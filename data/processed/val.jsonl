{"text":"The only reason I give this place a 3 stars is because of the service, and the fact that it's not the best place I've ever had a steak (that was in france 11 years ago). I came in alone the night before a flight, and the service staff was not really working for their tips. I sat at the bar alone, and I was able to order a drink and get a menu right away. After that, it seemed like a waiting game. After spending several years in Germany, where all you have to do to let the server know your ready to order is set your menu down, I went wrong and set it down and didn't say a thing. I'm a quiet guy, especially when I'm dining alone, but when I make eye contact with the bar tender several times while he\/she is making his rounds, that either tells me I'm just too quiet, or they aren't interested in serving a guy wearing a tuxedo t-shirt at a classy restaurant\/bar. Either way, I've worked many years in the past in the restaurant industry, and I know to never judge a book by it's cover. I think when I was finally able to order some food, the look on surprise on the bartenders\/servers face was either \"Surprise! This guy is gonna drink and dine and ditch!\" or Surprise! This guy ust wants to get a really good steak after eating nine months of crap in Afghanistan!\" Even so, after I got my food, one server asked ONCE how my cut of steak was, and the other didn't talk to me until I was done eating. Maybe it's just me, where I can go into a restaurant and expect the servers to have a conversation with a lone diner, or I just got used to the hospitality of some of the other restaurants around Nashville, but I don't think I'll be visiting this place again, despite how good the food actually was. Ambiance and feeling welcome have an impact on all your patrons, no matter how they're dressed, a single tuxedo shirt young man, or in a group of white collared corpos,","stars":3.0}

{"text":"We used Fox several years ago on a last minute local move.  While they did an onsite estimate, they greatly underestimated the time needed for packing and moving.  They had us sign a number of liability waivers which basically left them responsible for nothing.  The lead of the three staff members (all of which were local day laborers) showed up for the first hour and then left for a \"dentist appointment.\"  However, as I took the two laborers for lunch (as they had no transportation other than the moving truck) we saw the lead parked in another location in our apartment complex talking on the phone.  We never saw the lead again, however, he kept calling the two other staff and complaining that they took so long.  As Fox was hired to pack, they did not have enough boxed and had to use our U-Haul boxes and tape we had.  When we unpacked at the new location we found that the boxes Fox provided were cheap and many were torn in the move.  The Moving\/Packing staff did not know what wardrobe boxes were for and our clothes were stuffed in the wardrobe boxes with lamps and not hanging on the metal bars.  In fact, the metal bars were completely missing.  Nothing was packed with any logic.  Items in individual boxes came multiple rooms making it difficult to unpack.  We had a number of broken items, and a few items missing (i.e. a bottle of Crown Royal).  While we cannot prove that the Fox staff took anything, it is a heck of a coincidence.  From what the staff told us, Fox apparently takes about 50% of the quoted price for profit and then the remaining money is used for the expenses for labor, boxes and fuel (as Fox provides the truck).  As we are getting ready to move again we are looking for a moving company.  I see from the other Yelp reviews that nothing has changed, and we will not be using them again.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"We haven't stayed at too many independent hotels through the years. They are often second tier or lower from a review and cleanliness standard. This place is not like that at all!\n\nWe picked this hotel for a single night because we were seeing a concert at the Mahaffey and didn't want to drive all the way back home in Seminole County at midnight. There were some places that were closer to the theater but they were significantly more money and didn't really have better reviews. I super happy to report the gamble paid off.\n\nThe staff: Absolutely outstanding! Super friendly to a person and very knowledgeable. The desk staff was prompt and actually made eye contact and smiled. You'd be surprised how places we've stayed over the years were the counter staff behaved like teenage fast food workers and mumbled their way through the transactions. Not these folks! Real professionals. Even the cleaning staff was engaging and happy! And the bartender was a real bartender. So many hotels employ automatons and unqualified staff behind the bar. I believe his name was Christopher and he was fast, answered questions to all the patrons and smiled. He did this all while keeping a full bar very, very clean. That's a real bartender people! Very large craft beer selection as well.\n\nThe room: Ours was somewhat small but very clean. The king sized bed was more comfortable than most and the sheets were a higher quality than most as well. It's not really the type of room you hang out in unless you're in bed. The bathroom was tight but again clean and everything worked just fine. It had hardwood floors instead of carpet which we appreciated. Hotel carpet always worries me. You can change sheets but carpet is nailed down.\n\nThe building: I think it was built in 1933. All wood floors in the hallways make for a little more foot noise than usual but adds a lot of charm. These are the original or close to original floors. The parking is free but the lot isn't huge. Also don't judge the hotel from the parking lot view. You'll think you made a mistake if you do. The front porch runs the length of the building and looks an awful lot like pictures of Cuban porches. You want to spend hours out there. It's very wide and because the weather had finally cooled off some there were always folks out and about. Part of it is smoking so keep that in mind. The lobby is charming and the bar\/restaurant is the kind of place you'd go even if you didn't stay there. We didn't hang at the pool but the courtyard is very attractive. \n\nThey also have a free shuttle to take you the one mile to the bars, restaurant and events areas. Make sure you tip the drivers! It's how they make money.\n\nFor $60 or more off the price of the other places this is a no-brainer. Great staff and location!","stars":5.0}

The full custom closets were a bit expensive but everything else was real reasonable. But I'm sure the closets were reasonable if you were in the market for them.

When I called the restaurant to voice my concerns I was told there was nothing she could do and to call back tomorrow to speak with a manager.

{"text":"We purchased our couch on 8\/16\/2020 from Robyn Nemchik and have had nothing but issues since!! We were told the estimated delivery would be 2-4 weeks but becauee of covid, they are obligated to tell people 8 weeks. 8 weeks was no issue, as we understand that because of cov8d there are delays. However, I called the store over 6 times asking for updates on the delivery and was told different estimated dates everytime. However, we went into the store last weekend (10\/4\/2020) and were told that the couch delivery date was back on track and to expect to hear from them to set up delivery by 10\/16\/2020. Well of course we heard nothing and went back unto the store and were told that now the estimated delivery is sometime at the end of DECEMBER! Which is beyond frustrating as they have had our thousand dollars for over 2 months now and haven't called us a single time with any updates... and we are told different stories everytime WE call. Well today on 10\/10\/2020 we had the most AWFUL and traumatizing experience in store with the manager (i believe his name is doug) . We came in to see what our options are and coke to find out THEY ordered the wrong couch for us!! We have been waiting 8 weeks now, for the wrong couch! A mistake that qas made entirely by them!!! We weren't even aware of the color option that they went ahead and ordered for us. And the manager told us that because they placed an order for the wrong couch, we would have to start completely over with a new order... after waiting over 2 months!!!!!! And they said the wait could be up to 4 months for the correct couch to come because our order would start from scratch. The reallt traumatizing part of our experience qas when the manager (doug) refused to talk to my husband and walked away from him in the middle of the store and never sent another employee to help him. He walked away and said he didn't feel comfortable serving him. Yet, I walked into the store 10 mims later and led the conversation and doug was willing to speak to me (although he offered no resolution to the issue). He didn't feel comfortable serving my husband because he is African American, and felt comfortable serving me because I am white!!! This is blatant racism!!!!! We left the store crying and so upset for how we were treated and discriminated against. The worst part is that we received no apology for the HUGE mistake they made, and we can to no resolution. They told me it'd be 2-4 weeks to get a refund (which is absurd!!!) And this doesn't benefit me because I will not be able to purchase a new couch without a refund... when I paid in cash over TWO months ago, I should be able to get my cash back. In conclusion, I feel as though ashleys STOLE from us. They have had pur money for 2 months now, ordered the wrong couch (which never even came)... and now we have NO clue when pur actual couch would come. They are RACIST, IGNORANT AND THEIFS!!! I have been sure to tell everyone I know about this awful experience and plan to go to corporate and the better business bureau because we don't know what else to do!!! Terrible!!!!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"We had to get some food before heading over to Play for the Miss Genesis pageant so we decided to try out Clyde's on Church. I was a little worried about how packed it might be, but on Sunday at 7pm it was busy but not overrun and we were immediately seated.\n\nSo this place is very large inside. You have booths and tables throughout, ping pong tables in the front window, foosball in other areas, and it appeared even a patio. Booths were around the perimeter and there were some high top tables near the bar. Then there were lounge chairs\/couches seated around coffee tables made from pinball machines. That was pretty cool. Definitely large - you could get all your friends together here.\n\nSo we were really interested in eating. We waited a long time to get a menu...like long enough I considered leaving...but then we finally got one and I was mollified. The menu has a lot of items revolving around their smoked meat, but they also have other sandwiches, burgers, entrees, salads. I got the smoked bahn mi which was made with their smoked pulled pork, pickled vegetables, etc. and the boyfriend got brisket. We ordered some corn (like creamed corn with cheese) as a side and the BF had mac and cheese and gouda mashed potatoes as his sides. CARB LOAD! \n\nThe verdict? The bahn mi was good, although the bread was entirely too thick and big. I just dug the meat out from it and left the bread on the plate. Spice it up with some sriracha! The brisket was ok. The creamed corn was pretty freaking good as were the potatoes. Mac and cheese - meeeehhhh I have had better. It didn't have a lot of flavor, just really basic.\n\nSo I also need to mention the drinks. Naturally they have specialty drinks. But these were interesting as some of them reminded me of my college days. Hunch punch? Jungle juice? Gin and juice? Sweeeeeet! We proceeded to get hunch punch first (made with vodka, everclear, brandy, and triple sec). It comes out in plastic cups with colorful umbrellas on it and fruit pieces. Despite looking like total amateurs, the drinks tasted awesome. And they packed a punch! The next one we got was the John Daly with sweet tea vodka, citron, and triple sec. It also came out similarly decorated and was also really tasty. These are big plastic cups so you do get a lot of beverage for the $9. Plus, they use the good ice. You know, the Sonic ice. Interestingly, our waiter took our drink order but the drinks were brought out by someone else.\n\nOur waiter, Anthony, was the jam! We loved chatting with him and he had good recommendations for us throughout the evening. We enjoyed him immensely.\n\nOverall this seems to be a pretty solid place to come goof off, drink strong drinks, and maybe get some food. I suspect it might get a little rowdy and crowded on the weekend nights, but it was perfect on a Sunday night. I'll definitely be back!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This is the kind of bar that my grandfather would love. Good food, lots of \"old man beers\" and a fish tank \/ sports TVs to watch.\n\nOther old men agree, as this is filled with them. The music however, is not for old men with its Beck, Morrissey, and whatnot.\n\nThe roast beef sandwich is cheap and delicious. The golden brown french fries are good too. This isn't the place where two people should go to tie one on, but its great for a group of friends to have casual drinks and an array of party\/comfort food in a relaxed, spacious setting.","stars":4.0}

The patio dining is perfect, with local music piped in from WWOZ radio and plenty of room for any size group. The food here is superb and for extremely reasonable prices. I got 2 slices of pizza, an appetizer, and the delicious Limonata ice tea (iced tea with a scoop of Brocato's lemon ice!) for under $20 and had leftovers for a midnight snack. They feature daily specials with seasonal ingredients, and if you join their email list or Facebook group you will be showered with glorious coupons like free bottles of wine with dinner or 2-for-1 meals. Can't beat that, especially when they don't have to bribe me to go there! So glad I live close by.","stars":5.0}

My fellow Yelpers had eft pretty good reviews so I headed to Modesto Tapas. I called on the way and the lady added me for a last min reservation-(Saturday at 6:30 pm). As soon as we were seated, the entire place filled up. We were so lucky she was polite and gave us a last min reservation. \nI started with the seafood chowder. For only $3 it was a good size cup full of warm soup that was full of shrimp! As the evening progressed we had several other dishes, too many to remember the names of. However, the one that really sticks out is the goat cheese and mushroom with tomato sauce. It was very delicious. Every plate was delightful. The staff was friendly, busy, but friendly. The prices were very good. 6 plates for $42. Cant beat that!","stars":4.0}

Went with some colleagues the other evening and as we sat and talked about who's been here before (everyone), we also realized that of the 7 of us, none had ever had a bad experience at Berns. Whether it be in one of the 8 dining rooms, or the Dessert Room, we had all only been pleased. Service is exceptional and tonight was no exception. I forget his name, but our sever was helpful in wine selections and in choosing a cut. \n\nWe started with quite a few appetizers for the table: Oysters Rockefeller (creamy and perfectly succulent oysters), Steak Tartare (my fave of the evening with its zesty spices), Foie Gras (tender and flavorful, amazing presentation!) and crab cakes (beautiful plating and very meaty). \n\nThe majority of entrees are served with French Onion soup and salads, so had these, as well. I know it's a garden salad filled with fresh goodies from their farm, but I still got the Cleopatra (Caesar) dressing. I love it there. Thick and bursting with flavor. Honestly, if I didn't love steak, I'd get a Caesar salad. But, seriously, who does that at Berns'!?\n\nAnyway, for our entrees there was an assortment at the table. I had my 9oz Chateuabriand medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The cowboy onions don't do a lot for me, but the zucchini, squash and carrot medley was seasoned well and tasted great! I also had a bite of my colleague's Lamb Chops. Yummm!! Juicy and cooked to perfection!\n\nWe opted not to do the dessert room, but did do the kitchen and wine cellar tour. If you're a newbie, or even if you're not, I highly recommend this. It's always fun to look into the kitchen and see how they make things run so well!","stars":5.0}

Someone at the neighboring table kept pushing her chair right up to our table because they were so close. If we had shown up at the last minute, I could understand a table like that. But we had reservations for quite awhile. We did have great waitress - I wish I knew her name.\n\nAs for the food: The steak sliders were tasty as were the carrots. The carrots were a surprise suggestion by the waitress. The steaks were mediocre and too expensive for what you got. As this was a steak place so this was disappointing. We were excited about aligot. Where can you get aligot here? But we were served mashed potatoes, not aligot. The brisket macaroni and cheese was also just okay.\n\nSo sad that our experience was so meh.

When we finally got her attention, we asked for water because the spice level was super hot (which is how we like it) and we drank all of ours.. but the water never came.

I started by sampling a lil of (almost) everything on their buffet to see what I liked. To my surprise I really liked the Chicken Tikka Masala over rice. While this was my only win from the buffet they other nine people I was with enjoyed ALL of the buffet. \nWe were greeted with smiles, quickly seated and received prompt service. The overall experience was good, and why I gave a 4-star rating. While I will probably not return my co-workers are already planning their next visit.

We got the wings naked so we could just dip in whatever we wanted. Nice touch. They have a wing flavor for everyone - even salt and vinegar! The wings here, I felt, were better than Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\nFor $1 more you get two sides. I chose the fries and the chips. There was  enough food for 3 people after you included those sides...wow!\n\nThis place is in a hotel...so for what it's worth, most South Tampa \"cool guys\" won't venture into this place. Consider that a plus. \n\nThey have NFL Ticket here, so on a Sunday the place can be hopping. The service was very good while I was here. I was told to try the garlic & parmasean fries, but I decided to leave that for next time.\n\nIf you join their email club, they'll hook you up with plenty of offers. \n\nI can't wait to get back here to try some more items on the menu!","stars":4.0}

They can adjust how spicy do you want it to be. The rice dish isn't that much, but you can ask for more. I also love the Mango Sticky Rice dessert. The mango is sweet too.\n\nThe place is small. If you want to eat there with a group I would recommend no more than 6 people. Because of the small space and tiny tables and tiny chairs, bringing more people are going to be uncomfortable. \n\nThe waitress (I guess she is the owner) is very friendly. The wait time for the food is decent, not too long not too fast.\n\nThey also do delivery, which I've done many times too.

OK no biggie but the chicken was so good why not do some awesome fries too, its seems like a missed opportunity.  My wife had the stone fruit, heirloom and burrata caprese salad and while the cheese and tomatoes were awesome the fruits were a bit underripe.

The crab cake appetizer is amazing, with tints of cilantro and spices that puts your typical crab cakes to shame. \n\nI got the 24oz t bone steak. The steak was really nice, since you get to taste the different cuts. It wasn't out of this world, but it was a really good steak.

The leaves looked pretty close to the real things, especially the couple that were unfurling! \n  The taste of the terracotta pot and leaves were to be expected, a simple sugar taste. The brownies that were in place of the soil were great, I really enjoyed they were just simple brownie pieces, a bit on the dark chocolate side as opposed to the sweet side, not salted or anything else. As for the red velvet cake, it was the best part. There's not much to say other than it was great. The layers were done well, the cream was a perfect amount and great taste.

The location doesn't look like much either. If you can look past all that and enjoy the great cooking you will not be disappointed. I will tell you that I love Indian food but am not familiar enough with the culture to say what is and isn't authentic. So when we decided to go out with a group of Indian friends who were visiting in town we did not know exactly where to take them. They took matters into there own hands and told us that simply by looking at the menus they could tell us what place would be great. After 20 minutes of google searches for menus they decided this place was the best bet. And they were right! We started off with the vegetable samosa which was tasty when drizzled with the sauce it come with. We had the tikka masala appetizer which was perfectly seasoned, the buttered chicken was so flavorful and delicious and our friends introduced us to a new dish that  Is now one of my new favorites, malai kofta, which is a cheese based dish you must try. Overall,  whatever deficiencies they have on the service side are overcome by the execution in the kitchen.","stars":5.0}

It is really well laid out with a lot of space to peruse. The kids were quickly occupied in a back area set up for them and playing with an old school tabletop phone (they are totally intrigued by the hard-wire phone concept). Everything in the store appears to be quality and stylish. There are lots of homemade items as well as brand (eg., lots of Yeti). I found some cool canning jars, natural bubble bath for the kids;) and wife found some neat jewelry. If you are in the area or need of some homesteady supplies (they even have artisan feed!), I would recommend making some time to wander through this store!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Doubletree--Doubtful\n\nHave you ever noticed someone that doesn't belong in the community?  I have--several times.  And have you ever felt so terrorized and fearful of this person and his or her associates that you would never want them anywhere near you in your wildest dreams?  I have.  But, Fess Parker's Doubletree Resort (arguably a 5-star resort by all quantifiable (and yet certainly not humanistic) standards neither seems to be observant of their environment yet particularly concerned with their guests safety and welfare.\n\nAnd why do I say this, you ask.  As a frequent past guest who when I had the finances to do so, was known to spend WEEKS there at a time to the tune of sometimes $1000 per week or more, I thought I would be a good Samaritan and return a key that I discovered in the trash one day while recycling since I had seen this and other scary people in the area that I would not want them in my room or anyone else's.  Additionally, upon finding the key, there was no way to determine whether or not the person in former possession of the key knew that he or she had, in fact, lost it and therefore, no way to determine whether or not the hotel had been notified and made it an inactive key.\n\nSo, I walk several blocks away from the waste receptacle in which the key had been dumped for the sole purpose of returning this maybe inactive but maybe active key only to be told on my arrival that I am no longer welcome on the property and if I am to return to the property I will be arrested.\n\nWhen I attempt to explain that I was only trying tog do a good deed by returning a key to the hotel so that no one suspicious could enter a guest's room, I was argued with by the security guards who said, \"No, you weren't, you were harassing our guests.\"  \n\nWith no opportunity to defend myself or my reason for being on the property and with a verifiable history of spending a couple thousand dollars on the property, I  feel that his comments were inappropriate and unprofessional and for the cost of the quarters there, I will not consider \"harassing\" them or their guests in the future.","stars":1.0}

They recognize my family and I when we visit. They always interact with my baby, and she loves to \"people watch\" in this always busy restaurant! \n\nThe menu has typical dishes that a Mexican restaurant would serve. I typically go for a fajita chimichanga or asada tacos. If you like spice, ask for them to bring you the spicy sauces. They'll bring you three different thick, homemade hot sauces. So so good! My favorite is the spicy verde sauce. \n\nObviously since the name of the restaurant is Margaritas, I have to mention it. I love them! The 24 oz. options are usually a 6.99 special. \n\nOverall, we love this restaurant.

I spoke to a woman the next time who was apparently new, told me I had a one dollar credit. I said it should have been more because my whole order was wrong before and wouldn't order if that was all the credit would be. She said \"okay\" and hung up. I was really frustrated and called and talked to a manager, Kelly, who said I had a credit after all. I tried to order a pizza, which should have been free plus some because it was less than they'd messed up last time, and they said I went over the amount of the credit. I tried to explain that the time before my entire pizza\/pasta order had been incorrect so if I was going to be charged anything, then never mind, and she just said \"okay. Bye bye.\" I threw between 30 and 40 dollars down the drain last time I ordered there. I got no cheese on everything and they put cheese on everything, so I had to throw it away. I'm shocked at the lack of care they put into making orders in the first place, but even more shocked at the way they handled this situation. I will never eat here again, and I will never recommend them to anyone. Don't waste your money.","stars":1.0}

PJ's used to be a location for Remington's Steakhouse, and prior to that it was a Mexican restaurant, and who knows what else along the way. PJ's has been there for a little over 3 years, so let's hope that it's there to stay.\n\nThe basic layout of the place hasn't changed despite the various owners. There's an outdoor covered patio, along with an indoor bar area that has darts, pool and other sports, indoor and outdoor seating for the restaurant, and an outdoor stage area for the live entertainment \/ bands. PJ's has Open Mic nights for singers and musicians, Karaoke, and Trivia nights during the week.\n\nThe menu is a nice mix of classic bar appetizers with a few Irish specials like Scotch Eggs, Irish Bells, and Irish Egg Rolls filled with Corned Beef Hash. There's a nice mix of soups, salads, sandwiches, and burgers for lunch; and some heartier entrees for dinner including Corned Beef n' Cabbage, Shepherd's Pie, Bangers & Mash, and so on.\n\nBack in the bar you'll find plenty on tap including Guinness, Harp's, Smithwick's, Kilkenny, a couple of ciders, and more. You'll find plenty of traditional drannnnnnks like the Black & Tan, Snake Bite, and a Black Haze, along with craft beers, imports, and plenty to get you in trouble.\n\nFor lunch I had the Corned Beef Melt with a cup of Irish Potato & Leek soup.

To top it off, I found a twig in my salad and the manager said word for word \"I'm sorry the lettuce is organic and pulled fresh everyday soooo.....you might find a twig in there every once in a while.\" Hahhah Are you kidding me? The restaurant has so much potential, but the poor service outweighs the good food.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Amazingly, this restaurant lived up to the hype. We were on our way from Nashville to Memphis and my husband had read about this place, so we decided to check it out. Fortunately, we had read to call ahead to put our name on the waiting list. I'm so glad we did, because even though we called about 40 minutes before we arrived we still had to wait almost an hour for a table! We were there for Sunday lunch, so that's probably as busy as it gets. Still, you can call ahead up to an hour before your arrival. DO IT.\nI had the ham and eggs with grits. The grits were awesome, I wanted to lick my bowl clean. And the biscuits truly are perfection. I've never had such light, fluffy, buttery biscuits. Our server brought a plate of five to our table, and my husband and I each ate two and broke one into pieces for our 8 month-old. Then five more biscuits arrived and we ate four of them (and would have eaten the fifth except there was just no way to get any more food into our stomachs). Such gluttony, but so worth it. This was my son's first biscuit experience, and I had to explain to him that, sadly, it's probably all downhill from here for him as far as biscuits go. \nThe service was quick. Once we were at our table we were in and out in well under an hour.","stars":5.0}

Saw one couple go into the buffet on 3 different occasions so guess their taste buds were different than mine.\n\nCan get a much better buffet at my local Oregon casino.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I have never left a restaurant without ordering ever in my life but today I have. You shouldn't have to be made to feel like an inconvenience for asking for a table instead of a booth. It is also incredibly rude for the hostess who already made you feel like a jerk to shout out to the server on the way to a table \"this is your table by the way\" and then after seating you to then again go the server and loudly talk about you and your companion and the fact we had been seated out of the servers section. Just made us both feel like it was hostile and uncomfortable. The hostess was rude, hostile and seemed to lack basic customer service skills.","stars":1.0}

Today, they had Snow Crab clusters for $10.99 vs. normal price of $13.99. I also love getting my seafood steamed, such as catfish with Cajun seasoning for FREE - this way I don't have to dirty a pan when I get home.\n\nFor the most part, shopping their BOGO or items on discount is the smartest because it can def.

{"text":"Let me start by saying I have nothing against Pollo Tropical. I have been to other locations recently and they have been wonderful. However, this location can use some work. I went through the drive thru. There were two cars ahead of me and it took forever! I waited well over 20 minutes to get my food. When I finally pulled up to the window the man taking the orders looked sloppy, sweaty, frazzled, and just simply not clean. I hate to sound mean but honestly the man looked like he just needed a few days off and a good shower. It grossed me out a little bit to know this man had any hand in making my food. Well, I noticed a crumbled up bag sitting on the edge of the counter and said to myself I hope that isn't my bag. Sure enough it was my bag. It had obviously just been sitting there for the last 20 minutes since it was a small order. I asked the man at the window for sauce for my fried yucca and he looked a little annoyed and went to get some. It took him about 5 minutes to track some down. I decided I was not going to even eat that sauce as he had way too much time to tamper with it if he wanted to. I hope he didn't but who can be sure these days. So I finally get back to my work office to eat my food. No surprise my food was cold. The yellow rice was mushy. And my carton of fried yucca was half empty. I hate that this location is the closest one to my job! I am vegan and Pollo Tropical offers great vegan options. This location though is just not good! I don't think I will be back here anytime soon! Hopefully they can get there act together.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and had an amazing meal with one issue that ruined our night which is the only reason I am rating this 3\/5.  This was my second time at the resturant and we did the fixed menu for Valentine's Day and chose the San Sebastian which was $65 per person and 4 courses with 3 plates in the first and second courses, 4 plates in the third, and one dessert.  Before we ordered we started with a pitcher of sangria, the Temporada, which I highly reccommend.\n\nAfter receiving our sangria, our first course started to come out.  My favorite of the three was the cheese plate with the aged manchego and lavendar honey - it's a game changer, and the presentation of everything was fantastic. For our second course, the Scallops were my favorite, cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasonings.  After the second course we were definitely full and felt that about 6-7 plates for two people is definitely enough.  But then our third course came out and it was a great variety, in this course my favorite was the Berejenas which was seasoned eggplant, whipped goat cheese, and rasin\/walnuts.  Nevertheless, everything was very good and I would get each item again. Dessert shortly came out which was the olive oil cake - it was very light and different from a typical chocolate cake dessert.  \n\nEach course was spaced out with enough time, and the service was great as each person who delivered our food was friendly and explained what each item was.  However, it was up until we got our check that our experience was completely ruined.  I know Valentine's Day is a very busy night for restaurants, but you would also think that everyone would be on their feet and pay extra attention to detail.  My boyfriend had put his card in the credit card slot with the bill and we waited a very long time for our server to come back and run the card.  He then took the checkbook and said \"have a great night\" we were confused since he had yet to run the card, so when we came back we said we never signed a receipt and that we still needed to pay. First off, there were 6 card advertisements when we got the book back, which was excessive for 2 people. So he took the book again and gave it back for us to sign, at this point we were getting irritated because the credit card was missing, no pen, and no receipt to sign.  The waiter said he was running around as all his tables were closing out and insisted we did not give a card for him to run.  Well the server LOST our card! After a half hour of watching workers scan the area for which we knew they lost our card, a manager finally came over to us and said \"We lost your card\".  The manager handled this so poorly, she couldn't even explain herself let alone the reason for losing a card.  Being busy is one thing, but being completely ignorant to someone's payment and losing a credit card is unexplainable.  We then had to pay with another credit card and the manager said they would call and let us know if they found the card and that was it.  There were no apologies or anything to make sure that they could be as accomodating as possible.  Well it is Sunday and still no call from the restaurant as they said they would scour the place as they were cleaning.  Therefore my boyfriend is completely inconvenienced and needs to cancel his card and get a new one.  This is absolutely ridiculous and completely careless on the restaurants part.  The manager did not handle this appropriately nor did the server - yet we still left a 20% tip.  I'm disgusted with how this was handled and the fact that they were so nonchalant about the whole thing and did not even think to do anything to compensate us for waiting around and then losting a credit card.","stars":3.0}

At first we felt a little tipsy and a bit awkward but after settling in for a minute or two we didn't notice the slant at all! We had just arrived in New Orleans the night before and celebrated a bit too much so we weren't too adventurous in the culinary department! I had the Southerner and hubby had the Eggs Benedict, both pretty simple selections and both were outstanding!! Probably some of the absolute best gravy I've ever had with a very light biscuit and eggs cooked perfectly. Hubby didn't need extra Hollandaise or lemon which is probably a first! We shared a side of bacon and it was nice a crispy just like we both like it! \n\nOur service was spot on as well!  Very efficient and friendly yet super classy and professional. She kept waters full, delivered the food piping hot and had a smile every time we saw her.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving a 4 star review and not a 5 star is because they don't have any \"sweet\" offering on the breakfast menu. We usually like something such as a sweet roll or french toast to balance everything out so we were just a tiny bit disappointed when we found out they had nothing to offer.\n\nThe Royal House gave us the royal treatment for breakfast and we'll definitely be back next time!","stars":4.0}

I felt that the price seemed reasonable and they were kind enough to move some furniture that I believed they would simply clean around. I trusted them in my house and to me, that's everything. I will be using them again, no doubts. Also, the nice lady in the office called the next day just to make sure I was happy. I just really feel this is a trustworthy business.

{"text":"We tried coming to Koreana one time only to find, in the cold rain, crowds of college students blocking our way. So this weekend, after my day long yoga training, my fianc\u00e9 met me at Koreana for a much-needed refueling of spicy Korean dinner. Last time we couldn't even get inside, so I was surprised to notice that the interior is in fact far larger than the exterior implies. The place ain't pretty, much its clean and if you don't care about atmosphere than you won't care that it's kinda like a cafeteria setting - god knows all of the various college students that come here don't mind. Regardless, the bright and clean dining area was packed, so we opted to do take out and brought the following home: \n\nOjingeo Dup Bap (rice dish with squid, vegetables and spicy seasoning): the portion of squid and vegetables was, IMHO, quite small, but I was pleased with the level of spicy (could've been more, but I have abnormal levels of spicy tolerance). Vegetables seemed like Asian slaw, I would've hoped for large pieces of mixed vegetables, but at least the squid was well cooked and not rubbery - wish there had been a few more pieces of that, too!\nBeef Bokeum Bap (fried rice with beef, mix vegetable and black bean sauce): I didn't taste much since I don't eat beef, but my small bite of the vegetables really only had potatoes and onions, so I'm not sure what other vegetables, if any, there were. The black bean sauce is pretty good, though.\nKimchi Chigae (soup dish with pork, tofu, kimchi, and bowl of rice on side): SPICY, and tasty, there was definitely a lot of kimchi in there along with the chunks of pork, tofu, and slices of a fish ball (which provided some relief from the spiciness). You'll need that extra bowl of white rice to tame the flames on your tongue.\n\nThey gave us extra kimchi on the side, which was entirely unnecessary but delicious nonetheless. The prices are good, and each dish can feed one person (unless you're my fianc\u00e9, in which case, maybe get another dish). We both enjoyed the food, although our Korean friends say the quality is closer to street food than traditional Korean - but it's hard to find Korean in CC, so I'll take what I can get (esp for cheap!)","stars":4.0}
{"text":"My friend and I were excited about eating here for the first time, and even the difficulty of figuring out where to park and what door to enter, and being soaked by walking from the car to the restaurant, couldn't dim our enthusiasm.  Our waiter was delightful and the highlight of the entire experience.  We also enjoyed the singer. My friend ordered a tomato salad which she said was good, but our entrees were mostly disappointing.  She said the seabass over asparagus and carrots was just so-so and that her husband grills a better seabass.  My scallops baked in their shells were delicious but also too salty.  My entr\u00e9e came with a side of bacon wilted spinach.  In hindsight, I wish I had gone with my first choice, the tenderloin lamb with Chateau potatoes.  The waiter had convinced me to go with the scallops.  The glass of white muscadet I ordered was just boring -- I might as well have had water only.  But the truly disappointing aspect of the night should have been the best -- the desserts.  My friend said her cr\u00e8me brulee was very ordinary, and my choice, the semi-fredo chocolate vanilla (which was supposed to be chocolate mouse frozen with vanilla icecream) was terrible.  It was completely frozen and I could have used a knife to cut it.  Not flavorful at all.  I would have enjoyed an ice cream sandwich more.  I do regret not sending it back and trying something else.\n\nI don't anticipate eating there again for dinner, although I might try the high tea as a special occasion when a niece visits.\n\nMy only consolation was that I did not pay -- my friend did!","stars":2.0}
{"text":"This is a review for my Sips experience there. The staff was attentive and nice, which made me want to like the place more.

After my group came and we settled down, our waiter informed us about what the sips specials were. I ordered the cocktail they were offering that day. I forgot what it was..something with pineapple and vodka. First round of drinks came out, and I was slightly disappointed with my drink. It tasted like straight up pineapple juice, and there was just so much ice. I finished my drink before I even knew it (I am not an alcoholic!!). I ordered another one to give it another shot, thinking maybe they were in a hurry and made a bad drink. So my second drink comes out, and it was a bit stronger than the first drink, but still tasted very much like just pineapple juice. I left feeling disappointed with our sips destination for the week! Maybe it was just my drink. Next time, I'll try their food and other drinks.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Greek food is comfort food for a lot of folks and I was in a Greek food mood!\nAfter a quick online restaurant search, I decided on trying Spiro's.\nI was flying solo, minus my side-kick Fab Fianc\u00e9e. Now, that's amazing in itself, right?\n\nAt Spiro's, you walk in and proceed to a counter, grab a menu, place your order and then go find a table. Fair enough. The woman taking orders was very pleasant and kind. \n\nThey have a full selection of drinks in a cooler, plus typical soda fountain drinks with refills. Also, beer and wine. I got a fountain drink and settled in at a small table. \n\nIt wasn't a very long wait until a nice young lady brought my meal out to me. I ordered a large Greek salad plus an order of Dolmas or stuffed grape leaves with meat. More on the Dolmas in a moment.\n\nThe salad was quite large, I was wishing I'd only ordered a small, but I figured I could get a to-go box. \nOkay, so how was the salad? To some Greek purists, a true 'Greek' salad has NO LETTUCE. In that configuration, it may be called Horiatiki. And Spiro's has that available on their menu, listed simply as the Original Greek salad. \nI opted for mine WITH LETTUCE, called the Greek Salad on their menu. My salad came with Iceberg lettuce. There was plenty of it, that's not the problem. \nTo me, and again, a lot of purists, the only lettuce that should be used in a Greek salad is Romaine. Iceberg has very little taste or nutrient value, whereas Romaine pairs nicely with the other ingredients in the salad plus the dressing. I absolutely prefer Romaine in a Greek salad. Therefore, I was not overwhelmed with my salad. \nI will say, however, that their Greek dressing was very good, with a lot of flavor and balance. \n\nNow, back to the Dolmas. I love the organic earthiness of taking grape leaves and wrapping them around rice and meat. For just $2.99, I received a plate of six wonderfully juicy and plump, delicious Dolmas. I thoroughly enjoyed each flavorful bite!\n\nSo, where does all this put Spiro's in review terms? I liked that they have a full deli\/store area in part of the building. I LOVED the Dolmas. The Greek salad was just okay for me due to the type of lettuce used. \nMy only real problem?\n\nThe tables were less than clean. When I found my table, it was food-soiled, a newspaper on it, and more papers on one of the chairs. I looked around and the other available tables were food-soiled as well. I grabbed a few napkins, wet them and cleaned my own table. I saw several other diners do the same. A few patrons played musical tables until they found one clean enough for their liking. \nDuring my visit, I saw NO ONE come out to wipe the tables clean.\nThat's a shame, because the remainder of the restaurant looked to be pretty clean and tidy.\n(In hindsight, I should have mentioned this to someone, but they were pretty busy, and I really should not have to mention such a basic restaurant procedure).\n\nIn closing, a good Greek experience to be had, but there are some areas for improvement.","stars":3.0}

If you go on their Facebook page, you'll notice all the focus and emphasis is on their drinks. There's a good reason for that.

{"text":"I am literally the only person in my friend group who hadn't been here before, so it was fitting that I would have this wonderful experience on a packed Saturday night before we went to the Beyonce concert. Our wait was like a half hour but it was definitely worth it; we came around 6 on Saturday and started off with some drinks; or I should say the other girls got drinks and I got the irish coffee shake which was so magnificent that everyone else in my group ordered one too. The other thing I love about this place besides shoving alcohol into delicious ice cream things is that you can substitute any meat\/veggie burger into one of their burgers, even if it's for an additional price for everyone with dietary restrictions it works out so well. I got the texas ranger burger (grilled onions, poblano peppers, queso, on buttery texas toast-amazing!) with chicken instead of beef and it was so delicious I kid you not I shoved that thing in my mouth so fast I forgot I had eaten it. It was decently spicy too which I loved. I got a side of fries which were fresh and hot, with the chipotle mayo which was also slightly spicy and delicious. I will definitely be back because my friends' meals looked amazing (the bison burger, the buffalo burger, etc) and I want to try them all! Also more boozy shakes. Always boozy shakes.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I've had Paladar bookmarked for months and decided that the end of the mask mandate was the perfect time to finally visit.  It's an easy 10-15 minute walk from the Frenchman Street entertainment district.  The warehouse vibe is very hip.  The service was excellent from start to finish, which was commendable considering how busy the restaurant was this evening.  The cocktail and wine offerings are all you'd expect, and then some.  \n\nWe started with a Silk & Gravel (their version of an old fashioned) and the focaccia bread appetizer, which was very good, although some olive oil for dipping would make it even better.  \n\nThe roasted mushroom, leek, rosemary & fontina pizza was seriously one the best wood-fired pizzas I've ever eaten.  Yes, that good!  My date had the gnocchi, which was delightful, as well.  Loaded with chicken, edamame and pesto.  The table next to us had the pappardelle which looked even better than the gnocchi.  Next time!\n\nFor dessert we opted for the sinfully good, lightly-fried pound cake, with roasted strawberries and vanilla gelato.  Such a great, fresh and relatively light dessert.  Highly recommended!  \n\nThe mushroom pizza and strawberry dessert are reason enough to visit, but you'll find plenty to make the short trip into the Marigny well worth it!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"As you walk into the main lobby, you'll be amazed with how luxurious it is. Oddly, It reminds of hotels in Tel aviv, Israel . On the bricked sidewalks of Burgundy St. We parked our vehicle at SP Parking lot near New Orleans Street. I highly Recommend you drop luggage off with family at lobby before parking, It is a bit of a walk.   The check in process was easy and quick. Our group made a reservation a week in advance and requested early Check in, which was really helpful. The staff were very friendly and courteous.  There weren't staff to help carry luggage from lobby to room. Which didn't bother our group, it just made finding our room a little difficult. Behind the giant metal Security gate was a path between two building, that lead us to our little cottage like room. In front of our room was a courtyard with two two sets of patio furniture. Charming little area lol, 'Twas just the perfect area to chill, not far from our room and clean. The palm trees and shrubbery brought it all together. We'd hang out in the patio before exploring the French quarters.  Like the buildings around, our Building was pretty old. Unsure if it was because of the Moisture and humidity or if the building itself had all the original pieces from the early 1900's but pieces would come apart easily.  For those who have kiddos, be extra cautious because the buildings are fragile. The interior had a nice wood floor, with a single window with decent drapes. Wall outlets in various locations, which made it Phone charger friendly.  Two VERY comfortable beds which easily accommodates 4+. A huge dresser with a fridge inside of it, a closet and a t.v which we hardly used.  No complimentary waters so I suggest to stock up on a full case of water. The sheets were soft, wish a plush, cozy comforter. There is a closet to hang all your clothes with an iron and ironing board.  There wasn't a safe to store valuables.  While the city itself was hot, the rooms Air conditioning made rest possible. A nap was no issue after a hot mid day stroll. \u200d Equipped with all the amenities the Bar soap smelled like Sandal wood and a hint of Milk honey, no cheap shampoos or conditioners either.  Early morning check out for us was quick and easy. The location made finding breakfast easy where we had topped off the perfect trip at the Cafe Beignet.

The menu is eclectic with many items repeated at different meal times.  The beer menu is lacking and should have more local options, especially in St Pete where the choices are plentiful.  The prices are on the higher side.  The hummingbird pancakes are super sweet, but you get a lot . . . they can be shared.  My daughter said the bacon is nothing special and could tell it is made in advance.  The burrata is yummy and mixed with pesto.  The crispy avocado wedges is good, I wish the portion was bigger.  They are on the south fringe of St Pete.  They take reservations and can host larger groups.  We were able to get in on a Sat within an hour for a group of 10 on a busy weekend.

Although the restaurant is very tiny and always packed, the staff works hard to find you seating as quick as possible.

They have a bunch of different targets for sale as well as earmuffs and shooting glasses for you if you need them. They also have a bunch handguns, shotguns and rifles to rent.

I was expecting (with the website backing me up) that it was going to be modern whiskey flared barbeque restaurant.  We entered through the \"Bar Entrance\" which was where the confusion began.  Past the bar was a dining area filled with tables, but what was missing was a host stand. We picked a table and waited.  No one came over, no one acknowledged us.  We figured out after waiting five minutes that it was \"cafeteria\" style service bar on the other side of the restaurant.  The young guy serving the food was super helpful.  He explained the different meals and also told us if we would have sat at the bar, we could have ordered and had our food brought to us.  I was a little turned off that the place was not packed, the bartender saw us sitting there confused but didn't take the 20 seconds to walk over and explain the set up.  We ordered drinks after getting our food from the bar, and ended up really loving the bartender.. turned out to be super friendly and funny.\n\nWith all that being said... the food was decent. I got the pulled pork platter with a salad and mac n'cheese.  The side salad was HUGE, so I loved that.  I'm not a huge mac n'cheese fan but it was delicious (I'd pick it over the mac n'cheese from RUBB across the street).  The prices were reasonable and the size of the platters were perfect.  I think what saved the experience was the d\u00e9cor and concept that the owners were able to pull off.  The drinks were served in mason jars, each table had fresh flowers and there was complimentary rosemary water.  The ambiance was on point, and I would consider trying again simply for that reason.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"As a hardware aficionado, I am pretty picky about where I will go.  This is the old fashion hardware spot with a mechanical cash register from the 60s.  I only frequent places that are well stocked and have staff that are knowledgeable.  So this place qualifies on both counts.  That is the good news.  They also fix stuff like vacuum cleaners too.  They have some household appliances too.  Now a small word of caution.  This place is small and it is a hot mess in terms of organization.  They know where everything is but unless you like to root around in bins and on bottom shelves to find stuff, just ask.  I personally like this challenge and kinda get annoyed when service is over eager to help you.  This isn't a problem at Lee's where they definitely have a laissez faire approach to service.  The staff is nice enough when you talk to them but getting there can be a bit intimidating.  One dude seems to have a \"perma-frown\" on his face but he really was very nice when I needed help.

Dennis as bad knees or hips, (I can't remember which).

When you have your own business you do not make piles of money.  What you do is work your butt off!  Terri runs around that place like crazy.  I'd like to see anyone do what Terri does day in and day out, for all the years she has been there.  I've worked in restaurants both as a chef and as a server and had my own baking business.  I know what owning your own restaurant take:  Serious Energy!  Terri takes orders, delivers orders, keeps track of all the toast for everyone's breakfast, adds up checks, cleans off tables, buses tables, and stays on top of everything.  Plus she takes time to talk to her customers and bring the coffee pot around.  It's true that she is not a syrupy person but I can tell you this:  We have been going to this place for years and years.  When you really get to know Terri and Dennis you will understand some of the things they are challenged with and learn to appreciate them.\n\nMy favorite cook is Rooster.  You can see him through the kitchen window.  He's tall and wears a bandana.  \n\nWe don't go there too often for lunch but I was there last week with my girlfriend and ordered a turkey club.  I'm gluten free so I brought my own bread. There was no problem with my order whatsoever.   They didn't have any problems using my bread.   I've had the chili and it's VERY good.  The fruit cup is very generous and always has a nice selection of fresh fruits.  The home fries are made slices of potatoes, my favorite.  However, if you like hash browns they have them, too.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I began having mild symptoms that have been in connection with Covid-19 on Wednesday June 17, and therefore felt the need to get tested. We both work in health care and I work around a lot of compromised patients and staff on a daily basis. My boyfriend also had a flight already booked out of state for Father's Day a day or two later so that he could help out some family in need of assistance. Needless to say, we both wanted to know ASAP what our results were since we both had plans to continue working and he had travel plans already paid for. Our symptoms the day we got tested were again mild and could have been ANYTHING but they also could have been Covid-19... so we went to be safe. We found out that this TGH Urgent Care on Gandy provided Rapid Testing where you get your results back instantly. We had sought out this particular test because of everything mentioned above, and decided to head over there on Thursday June 18. This place does not take reservations or appts for Covid-19 testing which I understand some places don't and so we showed up at 9:30 AM to wait in line. When we arrived, there were already a good amount of people standing closely behind one another waiting to be seen outside. The line was half way wrapped around the building. I'd like to fast forward to standing outside in line now for 3 hours. It was now close to 1 pm. One staff member comes outside to check out the line and someone asks, \"Are there rapid tests still available?\" She says \"yes, we have boxes and boxes full.\" I assumed that most people there waiting with us that day were looking to have the same rapid test done for quick results. It's now 2 pm. We just made it inside the office! Guess what? We didn't wait 4+ hours to get inside to have the test.. we waited 4+ hours TO CHECK IN. TO FILL OUT PAPERWORK AND MAKE SURE THEY TAKE OUR INSURANCE INFORMATION TO GET PAID. One girl. One girl is checking people in. As soon as you walk in you can just see the sense of urgency that is LACKING. Why wait 4 hours to have us fill out paperwork that takes even longer to complete while we've just been standing in the sun for THAT LONG in close proximity to everyone who is here because they probably have Covid-19!? So after we have checked in, the front desk girl tells us to go wait in our car or go eat lunch since it's now past 2pm (\"but don't go too far since they'll be calling you soon hehe\") for another hour and that in an hour a doctor will call us individually to discuss why we're here and why we need to get tested so they can approve it. Then we would have to drive up to this outdoor tent outside of the office to get swabbed. Ridiculous right? But we're like whatever. Walk out, go to the car and drive not far off LIKE SHE SAID to grab a quick lunch at a drive thru. It has now been an hour so we drive back to the office to park and wait, thinking a doctor will call us soon for questioning. It's now 3:30pm. We get fed up again and go inside to ask when we will be called. This time a new girl is sitting where the other front desk girl was but still only one girl there to do everything. (People are still JUST checking in) Her name tag says \"in training\" on it. Awesome. She wasn't sure how to answer me so she goes back behind a partition to ask some staff who were laughing like they're in a break room where no one can hear them about where my boyfriend and I were in line. They quiet down and she returns to me, looks me straight in the face and says \"I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE ANOTHER 1-2 HOURS.\" Let me just skip another few hours later because I was livid. It's now 6:30pm. I get a call! It's Heather Greer, an APRN. She asks me a few questions like do I work in health care, do I have symptoms, and have I possibly been exposed to someone positive. All answers were yes. (Why ask me again when she can read my paperwork in front of her face that says the exact same thing) She knew my symptoms were mild and could have been something other than Covid-19. She knew I wasn't sure about being DIRECTLY exposed and she knew I needed to know ASAP to return to work and for my boyfriend to travel. I tell her we want the rapid test and we only came here for that and she tells me we can't have it. She said that we didn't fit whatever \"guideline\" for being able to have a rapid test done. IT IS THE ONLY REASON WE WENT TO THAT LOCATION. WHY WOULD ANYONE WAIT 9 HOURS FOR A STANDARD COVID--19 TEST THAT DOESN'T GIVE YOU A RESULT UNTIL A WEEK LATER!? YOU CAN GO LITERALLY ANYWHERE FOR THAT.

When I made the appointment I was told that the ceiling fans would be wiped down along with the air vents and I specifically asked if they could take care of some mild calcium buildup on the shower head. I was assured all these things would be done and none of them were. The shelves in the closets hadn't been wiped and neither was the exterior of the fridge or the bathroom doors. \n\nThe team lead let me know she broke a lamp in the main bedroom which I wasn't initially upset about it but upon returning from lunch and finding them gone with such a poor job being done and being charged the max price of $260 rather than closer to the the starting price of $173 I was upset and I unsatisfied. When I called to complain they immediately jumped to the excuse that it was because there was still furniture in the house (2 couches and a mattress upright against the wall,) none of my complaints had anything to do with the furniture or anything around it. They did offer to send another person out to re clean but I had to turn my keys in over the weekend and frankly it should have been a thorough cleaning the first time.\n\nIf you want a cursory cleaning go ahead and hire them, bit for that you could save yourself the money and do it yourself. Do a deep clean done right look elsewhere. I do not recommend.","stars":1.0}

To start, everyones drinks were unique and delicous. I opted for the watermelon mimosa, which was super refreshing!! I had a taste of the bloody mary which was fantastic (not typically tomato juice, the right amount of spice and complemented with bacon, cheese and other condiments). I had a bite of one of the cronuts (croissant-donuts) which was mind blowing. For my brunch, I choose something a little more savory. I chose the grilled cheese, which was filled with pesto, brie and mozzerella. YUM!! I was able to sub a side salad for the soup, which made it a little litter. The coolest part was the table side mimosa bar. We ordered 2 bottles of champagne and got plenty of juices to mix with (guava, blueberry, strawberry, watermelon etc). Overall, a great brunch, a great place. I will be back again!","stars":5.0}

Problems include:\n\n- Waiting for literally ten minutes to be helped because one employee was working on a takeout order and the other was trying to start the closing process ahead of time.\n- Complete lack of consistency in preparation. The menu is very small, but there does not appear to be any consensus on what ingredients are included. Most of the time the sandwich I order comes with slices of fresh mozzarella. Once it came with shredded mozzarella. It isn't supposed to have lettuce, but sometimes it does. They ask you if you want it cold or heated, but you have to watch like a hawk to make sure that this information is actually relayed to the person making the sandwich.\n- They have two kinds of bread.

The wait time to get a table can be a little long on occasions. The servers we had were very knowledgeable about the wine pairing for different meats and made great suggestions. While some consumers are disappointed with the portion size, I actually find it very adequate. You can actually enjoy your food and be satisfied, as opposed to thinking of ways to stuff it all in your stomach as to not waste any.\nThe Smothered fries and cornbread are a must try. they are so delicious! I have not yet tried a meat there that I did not find ridiculously appetizing. The ribs are amazingly flavorful, even the shrimp and grits rivals with some of the best seafood spots I have been to. The menu is diverse enough that even the pickiest of eaters will be satisfied. \n\nI think this place is surprisingly perfect for relaxed date nights, because let's be honest, most couples won't consider a BBQ joint as the classiest place ever when going on dates. At The Shaved Duck, you can enjoy a cool atmosphere while grubbing on a not so \"classy\" rack of ribs, with sauce dripping down your fingers and the whole nine :))","stars":5.0}
{"text":"My husband and his friend went here and couldn't stop talking about this huge amazing cobb salad. I thought how good can a cobb salad really be, right? So I finally went there yesterday and it was A-MA-ZING! It has the usual salad part of lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, egg and shredded cheese, but that's about all that was \"usual\" about it. It had loads of real thick bacon on it cut into strips, and a huge, and I mean huge, chicken cutlet that is so yummy I would have just eaten that on it's own. There was also crumbled feta cheese in there, which you usually don't see. I ordered this with the blue cheese dressing, and it was soo good. I would also suggest asking for some lemon and drizzling that on the chicken. Oh and there was sliced avocado on top of the chicken as well. You HAVE to try this. All this tray of salad and yumminess was only $8.99, which some people may think is a little spendy, but think of it this way, when you go to McDonalds and get a salad and any other \"inexpensive place\" you get a third of what the portions are at Jack's Cafe, and nowhere near the high quality ingredients for $7. I will definitely be coming back again and again!\n\nMy husband ordered biscuits and gravy and it was really good too. The second best in the world in my opinion. The gravy actually had good flavor which a lot of places it mostly tastes really bland. \n\nSomething else I would like to mention is that this place is totally different than the Jack's Cafe on S. Virginia. I don't know if it's owned by the same people, but to me it's a whole different animal. Definitely go to this Jack's Cafe on Victorian Ave in sparks!","stars":5.0}

The office is clean, and the children love the waiting games and prizes\/rewards. \n\n My biggest issue is that they FORCE Gas on kids every time they have anything done. My daughter got a small fill and some seals done and they wanted to charge me an extra $100 (after my insurance coverage) for gas...that she did not need. When I tired to decline the gas they berated me about her \"comfort\" and made me look like a terrible parent in front of all of the other patients because I choose not to give my children substances that are not needed. She was supposed to go back to school after a TINY fill and instead had to stay home because of the effects of the Nitrous Oxide after I gave in because they made HER feel like she was going to suffer greatly if she did not have it. In the end they did not charge me for the gas, but then made me feel horrible at payment for not wanting to pay for something that I had declined multiple times. \n\nI would absolutely recommend this Dentist to a parent that is fine with their child being un-necessarily gassed up for a fill.

{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but sad to say it fell short of expectations. Possible I just ordered the wrong thing. Got the tom yum noodles, which were alright. Pretty greasy, but definitely characterizable as tom yum. However, $17 (after tax and tip) for a plate of noodles with some mushrooms and tofu is pretty steep in my opinion. Service was fine. Located in the public market.","stars":2.0}

The adults can make the best out of it but for the most part it's for the kids. Lol! It was fun overall, to take pictures and enjoy time with your friends, spouse, family and kids.\nThere's no parking near by so you'll have to either park in a parking garage, find on street parking or find somewhere and pay and walk a couple blocks.\nPricing for these kind of venues can be a bit over priced. \n$75 for two tickets is a bit much just for what they offer. Doesn't really include much in that for two, no souvenir no noting. \nI do believe they may have packages for families or groups of 10+\nAgain really great for kids and a fun weekend for them to enjoy!","stars":4.0}

She said that they just found out about this bill. I could not believe that I owed for just having my teeth cleaned. She explained that at that particular time, I saw Dr. Jon and he is not in my dental network. I went to that office to have Dr. Kavanaugh as my dentist. I lay there after the hygienist finishes cleaning and flossing and when the dentist comes in to examine my mouth I have my glasses off and have always assumed it was Dr. K examining me. I was never told about the other dentist - and I'm sure that he announces who he is and I didn't pay attention. I was never told that a dentist who I never requested was out of network and that I was being billed extra. That was two years ago. I paid $20 and left without getting my teeth cleaned. I feel that this was very unethical and that they were not honest with me. On top of that, I was told that Dr. K doesn't work on Tuesday and that Dr. Jon was there this afternoon. I'm not going back to that office EVER! I don't like when people take advantage of senior citizens on a fixed income. Shame on them!","stars":1.0}

These are also the best lox I've had in New Orleans, nice flavor, great texture. You can get a half or whole portion of lox, and the portions are huge.

{"text":"We had a number of recommendations to go to Cochon, all of them from the same person. Since it was right around the corner from our hotel, we figured it was worth a try. The restaurant smells great and is both lovely and roomy. We were seated immediately and I was given a good recommendation on Bourbon, a Jefferson Reserve with one rock. \n\nWe ordered the fried gator and the blue crab rice to start. The rice was very tasty with a good balance of crab and the seasoning was enhancing rather than flavoring. \nThe fried gator was like a wet dream that buffalo popcorn chicken has.  Great flavor and perfectly cooked. \n\nI ordered the Cochon which is served over cabbage with the fried pork rinds.  Initially I was not impressed until I started getting these perfect bites of pork that melted in my mouth with a bark that added just the right chewy crunchy feel, balanced against the cabbage as well as pickled turnips. The turnips weren't particularly great but everything else was.\n\nMy companion had the short ribs. The waiter discouraged the folks next to us from having them which I consider a disservice as it was the best short ribs I have had. Smiley with a perfect bark, legitimately melt in your mouth. If it doesn't melt in your mouth then slow down.  She kept closing her eyes. The accompanying potato salad was modest and just right.  \n\nWe had to ignore the desserts for our own safety but they looked great. \n\nService was very good. The kitchen is open and they were fun to watch, energetic and clearly a good team. \n\nWorth getting out of the French Quarter for.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"It's been about a month since I had Flow King come out to correct this problem and guess what... the line already clogged, resulting in my basement flooding again, causing damage right after I had fixed everything from the previous flood. When I called Flow King to tell them the problem, they said that it was not their fault and a result of the heavy rain. Really?? I've lived in this house for a few years and have only had this issue recently. I even spoke with the manager who would not take any responsibility and said that it was not covered under any type of service warranty (even though it's been about a month) but they would come out for a minor service fee. With that frustration, I decided to go with someone else. Able Rooter diagnosed the problem and showed me that Flow King used a spade to puncture the clog just enough to drain the current flood water but not fully clear the clog. Essentially, they half assed the job to get it done quickly, but not correctly. This time the correct tools were used, and the main stack is clear all the way from my house to the alley. It is beyond frustrating to know that I went with Flow King and not only received awful,incompetent service and high pricing, but I also worked with a company that wouldn't stand by their work. I really hope the manager reads this review so that he can be embarrassed by the service they provided and know that I will be sure to persuade everyone I know not to use them in the future.","stars":1.0}

We did not get any drinks (shocking, yes) but will come back sometime since they do have some interesting options that look pleasing. We ordered the burrito Del Mar which was very tasty, covered in queso (yum!) and had a fair amount of seafood - which I appreciated since it was on the higher side for pricing. It was served with beans and rice, both were standard but good. We opted for 2 a la carte pork cochinitas tacos as well. We were surprised the a la carte tacos came with rice, which was nice. The pork had a good flavor, was slightly spicy, but unfortunately a little dry. The chips do not appear to be made in house, which is likely a downside for some. They are standard chips, not the thin crispy kind (which i prefer). My husband really enjoyed the salsa. I thought it was just ok. It did taste house-made but had a flavor I couldn't quite pinpoint. We recommend giving it a try and will be back to try some new items and a margarita someday soon, since the service was friendly and the seafood burrito was a win.

I have maybe only been back once in the morning since my last review so I have no idea if they fixed most of their problems.\n\nWhat I do know is that they got some solid people working in the afternoon. Whenever I go in after 5pm, I never have a problem. The people who work there now know how to chat and be friendly, but without ignoring customers who walk up (I have a couple of friends who work here and they will stop talking to me to help a new customer - something I totally respect. A lot of problems I've had in the past had to do with baristas who spent too much time chatting with friends). The food is also made in an understandable amount of time in the afternoon. \n\nIce coffee is still too expensive, though. $2.25 for a small?

While the bar is small, the cocktails were done properly and not with pre-mixed sirups and the rum tasted of a decent quality.\n\nFor the appetizers we ordered the turtle soup and the crawfish bisque. The soup comes with a little flask of cherry so you can 'sweeten' it to your leisure. Both were very flavorful with a good balance of spices.\n\nWe followed with the veal chop and the crawfish dinner. The veal was generous and cooked exactly as ordered (medium well), oooh so tender... Yum. The crawfish dinner was a sampler of 4 plates. The crawfish tails were small like shrimps, few were longer tha. 1 inch but I assume that's from the season (dec 30) but they were plenty and generous quantity and still tasty (not fishy at all). One of the samples was just a bit on the salty side but the other 3 were just right. One touch I noticed was that they spruced *fresh* chopped parsley (most French quarter places we want to sprinkle dried parsley, and that tells me a lot).\n\nAfter all that we were quite full and managed split a bread pudding. I grew up in a French town were every bakery sells bread pudding, and this was just as good. I was afraid that the whiskey in place of rum would not work as well but it was server with cream to mellow it and it worked perfectly.\n\nOverall service was in par with the price. Portions were on the generous side for a restaurant with this quality. My only regret is that we could not make a reservation for New Year's Eve.","stars":5.0}

My second time, my friends and I ordered sides of their vegan sausage. It was not my favorite and I wouldn't order that again. The biggest down side is that Green Eggs is cash only.

{"text":"So, I had a few hours to burn on my stay here in Indianapolis, and made a point of coming to visit their art museum.  I am so glad I did because it was a beautiful place to see.\n\nWhen I first got there, my initial impressions with the entance.  Beautifully landscaped, well maintained with amazing sculptures out front.  They have this display of snails going on throughout the museum that I loved.  Beautiful.\n\nI walked in and it was $18 admission for the whole place. I started with the outside garden area which was so nice to see. Plus, the weather was perfect.  After I cruised around outside, I was ready to head back into the air conditioning. The first floor has some stuff there, but not as much as the second, third and fourth floors.  I went up to the second floor and checked that out as well.\n\nI think my most favorite display was the contomporary display. It was awesome! They had a straw chair, a big foot, all kinds of funny furniture to look at and so much more.\n\nSome of the other art there were paintings, african art pieces, asian style art work and much more. They also have a cafe and a gift shop here, but I didn't get a chance to check them out.  If I am in the area, I would gladly return!","stars":5.0}

They are crispy thin \"cigars\" filled with just the right of cheese and are simply addictive.  The Maria Arayes are like quesadillas; not as great as the cheese rolls, but respectable.  I enjoyed the fresh little salad and fries served in advance of our entr\u00e9e, though it is strange to have fries as an \"appetizer.\"  The kebab sampler is very filling and worth sharing.

{"text":"Capital Grille is a pretty decent steak house.  Very business-like setting, very manly feel to the place.  Also conveniently located as a pre-show meal to performance centers like the KImmel on the Ave of the Arts, which is what drew me here.\nIn Philadelphia, I would say that Capital Grille is a step up from Ruth's Chris, Sullivans and Mortons.  It is on par with Smith & Wollensky's.  And finally is a few steps down from Barclay Prime.\nDid I have a good steak at Capital?  Yes.  Was it cooked to my specification & of a nice quality?  Yes.  Was it one of the best steaks I've ever dined on?  Nope.  Was it particularly memorable or special?  No again.\nSo what did I have?  Well I tried the French Onion soup which was a really good traditional French onion soup, the cheese especially was melted to perfection.  I also tried the fresh mozzarella, tomato & basil  salad.  Started out pretty good, but was a little too filling & was a bit bland all in all.\nFor my steak I ordered the filet oscar (oscar being topped with lump crab meat).  Like the rest of the dishes it was good, but not outstanding.  Your usual high quality cut of beef.  I became quite full while eating it & didn't bother to finish.  It wasn't so amazing I was willing to force it down my throat.\nWe ordered a side of potatoes au gratin.  These were quite tasty but outrageously hot.  It was a good 10 minutes or so until I was able to comfortably eat them.\nI do have to say that as far as the soups & salads go, the portions were of a generous size.  Now the sides are meant to be a larger portion because they are meant to be shared, but not so with the rest of the dishes like the salads & appetizers.  So, always nice to get a lil more bang for your buck.\n\nLike everything else at Capital the service was definitely good but not spectacular.\nSame with decor (actually, bug thumbs down to all the taxidermy!!), same with oh...everything at Capital Grille.\n\nIn the end, yes its a very nice traditional (business-y) steakhouse & while I wouldn't recommend against going, one visit was enough for me.  If I want to spend decent money on a good steak dinner there are places I feel are more worthwhile.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"The main problem I have with Sportsman's has been that I visited it with a group of people at 6pm on Wednesdays for years and nearly every time the service was so bad it was laughable (and we have many notes from the evenings about it too).\n\nWhat I learned on the patio over the years before our group left:\n\n1) If at a group, anyone pays and has to leave, you can expect service to stop to the table.  Your waiter will look occasionally to see if the rest of you are done.\n\n2) If seated and nobody has come to see you in 10 minutes they forgot you.  We ran the clock up to an hour and 15 minutes one time before going in to grab drinks, at an hour and 17 minutes we had a waitress.\n\n3) If it's 6pm \/ happy hour, you must order every drink you're going to want for the next hour at that point as you're most likely not going to get a second drink order in before happy hour ends at 7.\n\n4) No matter how you try to contact the manager electronically or by leaving messages, you will never get a call back unless you're wanting to rent the place out - we tried seeing if we could get an extension on the drink specials if we were bringing in an average of more than $200 a gathering, and were never able to get a second round of drinks due to nobody ever coming back out to serve us. Calls and emails went unreturned, so did our business.\n\n5) If you have a really good waiter, they will be gone and never back there the next time you're there.\n\n6) If you sit on the patio and there're 3 waiters working, you will be told that the reason service is so slow is that the 1 waiter you've got is also handling the largest table inside.  If you happen to go inside there will be one table of 6-8 people and another table or two of 2 people and no particular reason evidenced to why there's no way to get a second round of drinks before happy hour ends.\n\n7) If you have an event that will pay off immediately and not over the course of 4 -6 weeks in profits, you will receive a call in under a day.  Learned this when we had contacted them about how much money our group was spending and one of the group also contacted them for a private party for work.\n\nThat's about that.  The food is average, there're a couple of vegetarian options and they're ok but not good bar food.  on a 2-4-1 they serve you both beers at once, which means they're warm by #2 unless you're a hardcore alcoholic.  I, and the group I'm with, want to love this place (it was home for years in spite of the service) but we've consistently been treated like we're an imposition, and the place is always less than 1\/4th capacity when we're there so it's not like we're taking up space, and our bills and tips are high enough.\n\nThat's my review, mostly seen from the patio as that's the reason we went to Sportsman's.  We have not been back in a while.\n\nEdit 10\/20\/2010 - service was good, still don't know why we went back - get there before it starts to suck again \/ current good outdoor waiter quits.","stars":2.0}

You can probably tell which one I listened to today when I was in the mood for breakfast...\nI could have saved the $7 bucks that I spent on the pancakes, eggs, sausage links and coffee.... The last thing that any of this could described as would be \"served hot\".. It was possibly warm at best... The sausage was small, greasy, and tasted very porky.... kind of like they turned down the Grade A pork that the supplier suggested they buy, and served me the Grade D sausage..

As a new customer, no one discussed services or prices. I asked for a pedicure and gel manicure. The tech never asked or showed me how the massage chair worked. The soak was plain water. My feet were as rough at the end of the \"pedicure\" as they were walking in. While getting the pedi, a second tech started working on my nails. I'd waited until my nails were the exact length I wanted, to get a manicure. I told her they were fine, but she proceeded to destroy them right down to the tips of my fingers. I was livid. When she did the color, she stared at her cell phone the whole time, and the manicure was amateurish. The manager seems nice, but holding her staff accountable for their work, and trying to interest me in being a repeat customer apparently weren't as important as her cell phone or vacuuming. $50 plus $10 in tips, and an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back.

{"text":"One word: Buenisimo! \n\nKnowing this came from the same bloodline as Tinker Street, I was certain Festiva would be a great addition to the neighborhood. From the atmosphere to the waitstaff to the food and drink, Festiva is doing things right. \n\nIt's a pretty casual place, but it's nice enough for a Friday night date and classy drinks. The menu is small, but it's full of all the right things--denoting what's gluten-free, vegan and vegetarian (and plenty of options for those subgroups). It's a menu designed for sharing dishes, but it's not quite tapas style. \n\nFor two, we ordered the guacamole, and all the other reviews are right on target--some of the best I've had. It's sprinkled with pomegranate, fresh jalape\u00f1os and cilantro, and the chips they pair it with have the perfect crunch and are just thick enough to dig in for a big scoop of avocado and withstand the pressure. \n\nI ordered the sopes from the appetizers for my meal. They had a little heat already, and I added some salsa on top to add to the deliciousness. It was just enough to be satisfied but not completely full. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos. It says for two--and we shared the pickled veggies and the salsas--but he cleaned up the rest of the dish on his own. \n\nNow for the margaritas. I'd live on the Margarita Estacional if it wouldn't qualify me as an alcoholic. It was muy delicioso. The perfect combination of flavors, and the blood orange is a nice little treat at the end of the meal as well. Don't let the habanero scare you; there's no kick to it. The only way this drink could be better is if they offered it in pitchers.\n\nThe waitstaff was super friendly and attentive. The food came out quickly, but they didn't rush you through ordering or dining. The owner also spent the evening stopping by each of the tables and introducing himself--maybe because it was one of the first few nights, but it was a nice personal touch to the service.\n\nHasta pronto, Festiva!

Good coffee was also a must.

I ended up ordering the homemade granola and yogurt, a cappuccino, and a chicken biscuit- so a little good cat and bad cat.

My husband's breakfast club was very tasty (and messy). The side potatoes had very nice seasoning and we guessed cooked in some yummy bacon fat. The granola parfait had a lovely fruit medley. We both also really enjoyed our coffees. \n\nThe service staff was all very friendly and attentive. The only note I do have is: it is very noisy inside! They need to bring in some sound deadening elements to the space. \n\nAll in all, the food was tasty, the service was great, and the ambience was cool.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"My 1000th Review!\n\nI waited too long to eat. I'd been sitting in my stylist's chair and my tummy was getting angry with me, so that when I finally was able to get food I was grumbly and moody. I opted to head to the international mall and decided to try The Earl. \n\nI'm sad they don't have combos, so everything turns out to be really expensive, but the food is very good. I had a bowl of soup and a buffalo chicken wrap, of which I ended up only eating half - see if there was a combo that allowed 1\/2 a sandwich and a cup of soup, it would have been better and I wouldn't have wasted money!\n\nThough I did end up getting a better deal on a drink, since they were out of small cups, they had to give me the big cup for the price of a small. \n\nService was quick, the food was good, I'd give them another chance.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I've been here numerous times over the last few years. I am really pleased with my finds and have saved at least over $1,000 in that time. \nThe layout is easy to navigate and there's tons of stuff you didn't know you needed. The shelves and racks are crammed, so know you're going to spend some time looking. You never know what you will find. \nClothing labels run from almost generic to high end. The quality and amount of use still in it compared to the price is great; I've never felt like I got a raw deal. \nToys are wonderful finds, all sorts of fun blinky noisemakers to awesome learning ones. The toys I've purchase this far have all worked, almost as good as new or thereabouts. The only gripe I have is some parents treat the toy section like a playground, allowing their kids to go nuts in there. The staff is nice enough to not scold anyone or make them feel like they should leave. \nStaffing is fine. Seems to be high turn-over but I have no gripes. It's not Macy's, folks. I've been treated courteously enough, and I am very particular. They are very stringent on the items they buy. I've been surprised everytime by the things they chose to reject but I chalk it up to overstock usually. \nThey also have periodic sales and clearance specials where I make out like a bandit. Make sure to sign up for the email announcements. They also have a stamp card for purchases and things you sell, one stamp per  $10. Fill the card and you get 20% off next visit. Pretty sweet, all in all. It's my go-to for kid stuff.","stars":4.0}

The hostess was friendly and didn't make me feel out of place.\nI sat at the bar and was promptly greeted and given an ice water by Jeff. I am terrible at making decisions because I want to try everything. I narrowed down a few drinks and Jeff helped me decide on the #34 or #37 - can't remember. It was delicious, sweet and smokey - YUM! \n\nAgain, with the pizzas I could not decide. With the bartender's help (again) I decided on the egg, pancetta & sage pizza. There is no sauce, but the egg covers that. It is SO aromatic and the pancetta is perfectly fatty and delicious.\n\nThe crust was crisp, fluffy and utter perfection. The only pizza complaint I'd have is the white of my egg was runny and uncooked in parts. I just have egg OCD. Otherwise, it was heavenly.\n\nI had a glass of white wine with my pizza that was a perfect pair.\n\nIt isn't easy to get a great experience in a bar, by yourself at closing time. TGP totally delivered. I will for sure be back.\n\nA cocktail, glass of wine & pizza cost me $39 pre- tip. A little pricey to some, maybe, but well worth every penny.","stars":4.0}

I made a reservation for 12pm, but it wasn't busy. From the outside of the restaurant, you would not expect the interior to look the way it did. Inside, it was farmhouse d\u00e9cor with mid-century modern furniture, and felt like you're in a little village, in a cute way.\n\nAs for the food, the food was freakin delicious.

{"text":"I used to go here a few years back and never really had an issue. Last week I was in here and it Waac completely different. My mother and grandmother had warned me because both had gone here for years and stopped because of their I incidents. My grandmothers nails were filed so thin that they split straight down the center and my mothers big toe nail was cut on the side so far back that it created an ingrown and when they asked their nail tech not to file or cut, the nail tech proceeded to act like they did not speak english. Well my experience was similar. I've gone aNd had the owners  do my nails there and NEVER had a problem, they are actually amazing at their job. However, the staff being hired, not so much. Not only were my nails filed so thin that 3 split within the same day but now I have an ingrown toenail and NEVER had that issue before. The tech even changed the nail color I had picked without telling me and when I asked why it didn't look like the swatch she then acted like she did not know English. She was very rude and even when I would ld ask a regular question she had no response at all. I hope the owners start to find techs that care about their salon as much as they do because it will have a huge impact on their company if they don't. I have been in the beauty industry for the last 15 years and have seen a lot of salons effected because of a staff involvement.","stars":3.0}

It also became obvious as we tried to chat after our meal that they desperately wanted to turn our table. This is not a place for a leisurely meal with chatting involved. \n\nAdditionally our food left much to be desired. They put the red onions on almost all of their sandwich selections. It appears they don't know red onions are such a strong flavor it takes over almost all other flavors. My wife's and my fries were cold. My sandwich was very dry.

This pleases me as I don't have to deal with driving to the west end, traffic and parking issue with the West Edmonton Mall location.\n\nT&T Supermarket specializes in Asian consumables including; groceries, food, health care products and baking. The store is large and you will be hard pressed to not find what you're looking for, from Philippino, Chinese, Japanese, Thai or the like. I'm told by my Asian friends that it's authentic and the products are in keeping with traditional cuisine. \n\nOne of the things I like about T&T is the great selection of seafood, most of which are live in large holding tanks waiting for you to take them home. Now, my husband is a Newfie so fresh seafood is a must and this is one of the best places in town to get it! They also have a pre-cooked\/prepared meals in their deli section (sushi, Chinese BBQ, roast duck, etc.).

{"text":"Dr Holcomb goes above and beyond to care for her patients. I'm still in awe of my experience with her during Hurricane Barry. If you can imagine, the night before the storm is supposed to make landfall, I find several lesions on my 11 yr old. I panic because everything is closed!  I attempt to contact her via the patient portal but can't find my password. Luckily, I find an old email from her office and respond asking for an on call physician and HELP!! I thought at best I could take her to urgent care the next day but to my surprise I got a reply. Not just any reply, a response from Dr Holcomb HERSELF!  Just having your doctor respond, while she's caring for her family during a storm, speaks volumes of the importance of patient care to her. She ruled out several things by picture and told me how to care for my little one until the storm blew over. On Sunday, yes the weekend, she checked her schedule and told me there was a small opening where she could squeeze us in. I breathed a very heavy sigh of relief and my daughter is fine. I still think of her kindness and willingness to help us during an emergency weather event.  Sometimes doctors do their jobs but in Dr Holcomb's case, she actually takes care of her patients and their freaked out mothers.  My 11 yr old loves her office and said she's a \"cool\" doctor.  I can't thank her enough and I'm so grateful for the years of care and generosity she's shown.

We always get swamped on Sunday, but we always just order the same amount of bread as the rest of the days, so then we run out real early.\"\n\nMe: \"Um, okay. What can we substitute for that large then? Maybe a medium and a small?  I see you have different size bread back there, and I was really hoping for a large...\"\n\nHer: \"Um, I guess we could take three of the small pieces and make sandwich nubs. Let me check. \n\nHer: (To other employee): 'Do you feel like making a large out of three small pieces of bread? \n\nOther employee: (sitting there with a 'OMG, I have to work today?' look on her face) \"Not really.\"\n\n\"Not really\"?  Did I just hear you correctly?  \"Not really\"?  I order the sandwich, you make the G*@!#$%# sandwich. There is NO \"Do you feel like doing your job today\" discussion needed.  \n\nAnd by the way, how about reviewing your ordering process. If you know you run out of bread every Sunday... Work with me here...  Are you seeing where I am going with this?  \n\nOn top of that, my friend waited LITERALLY twenty minutes for her sandwich (when there were only three sandwiches ahead of hers, by the way) and when it came out, it was missing a bunch of normally included ingredients. Like peppers. And mustard. How worthless of an employee do you have to be to take twenty minutes to make a sandwich, and then forget a third of the things that are supposed to go on it. But it's okay, because they pointed her towards the mustard packets.  No \"sorry\", no \"we'll fix it\", just... point. Oh, and then giving her attitude when she asked where the peppers were that were supposed to be on her sandwich?  Wow. Just, wow.  I guess I didn't realize this particular beach hut was a division of WARC.\n\nI also noticed your tip jar was bare. Not surprising, based on your performance.

{"text":"Other than being way off the beaten path for us (all the way up in West Clay), Danny Boy was a great bar with a cool atmosphere and delicious food.\n\nIn addition to Danny Boy brews, the bar had many other taps (somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 beers altogether between the Danny Boy beers and the others). They have the tap list on a TV screen that scrolls through, so I got the impression they're able to keep it updated easily. The Danny Boy beers I had were all good -- crisp tasting and typical of their styles.\n\nThe food was very good as well. They have a sandwich option called a baco that is basically a puffed up flatbread with the sandwich fixings inside. I had the pulled pork version of a bacco and it was delicious but extremely spicy for me because of all of the jalapenos. Still, the flavor was really good and thebread was warm, toasty and buttery. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak baco and he enjoyed that permutation of the sandwich as well (though it was not very much like an actual Philly cheesesteak, rather than a very loose take on it -- still well done and worth getting a second time). We were struck by how hot and fresh all of the food tasted. \n\nThe feel of this bar is very industrial. Lots of metal and exposed duct work and what not. They also had garage doors on at least two of the walls that were open for the nice weather. \n\nMy only complaint about Danny Boy is the bathroom situation. The bathrooms are just two single one-person bathrooms, but they're unisex so by 10 p.m. on a Saturday night they were getting kind of gross. Not ideal. I'd rather have one relatively clean ladies' room than a choice of two bathrooms with the toilet seats up.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I just got a colour, foils and cut from Propaganda Salon - I'm new to Edmonton and was looking for an Aveda salon because I don't get an allergic reaction from their hair colours (whereas I do get headaches and burning, hot scalp from other product lines).  I chose this salon based on the other positive client reviews.\n\nI called this morning to see if I could get in some time this week.   Donna the receptionist called me back shortly after they opened for the day, and she was able to work me in for an evening appointment!   When I arrived, Donna greeted me and was very friendly.  She promptly took my coat and my information, and right away I was introduced to Cassandra (the junior stylist) and Gwen (the owner\/senior stylist).  Gwen and Cassandra consulted with me about my colour, then under Gwen's supervision, Cassandra applied the colour.  Cassandra was friendly, a good conversationalist, and careful and thorough with the colour application.  While the colour was setting, she gave me a (what I hope was complimentary) hand massage.  I also got a nice head and neck massage after the colour was shampooed out.  \n\nOnce the colour was done, Gwen did the actual haircut.  She is a very nice lady and clearly wants to help you get the look you want and ensure that you're completely satisfied with it.  She took lots of time tweaking the cut and would check with me to make sure I was happy - and she genuinely wanted to know and would make changes to anything I wasn't completely happy with.   I have super-thick curly hair - it's unruly and needs a lot of thinning and texturizing, and it takes longer than usual to colour and cut - I got there at 6 pm and by the time we got done the colour application and got to the cut it was already 9:45 pm!  Despite the late hour, Gwen gave no indication at all of being tired or in a rush - she took as much time as was needed and at no point did she make me feel pressured or like I was an inconvenience.  It was well after 10 pm by the time we were all done, and she still gave me a lipstick application and a bit of blush - just as she would any other client at any other time of day!   She also told me that if I had any issues with the cut or couldn't get it to lay right etc. within the next week to 10 days of styling it myself, that I could come back in and she'd texturize\/tweak it more.  It's so great to get a \"satisfaction guarantee\"!\n\nMy only complaint\/issue was the price - the total cost for the colour, cut and partial foils was $250.  My hair is thick and I do require extra colour product, but I was still a bit shocked by the cost.  In Lethbridge, AB, at the Aveda Salon, I could get the same amount of services for about $100 less.  But, maybe in Edmonton, this is not an extravagant amount for what I had done.  Considering the amount of time it took, too - more than 4 hours - maybe this is not an unreasonable fee.  Still, I thought it was a bit high, and honestly as much as I loved Gwen and love my hair cut, the cost might be a deterrent to going back in the future.  But if $$ is not an issue for you, I highly recommend Gwen and her staff.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Wow Gusto. Just wow.\n\nI had never had authentic Cuban cuisine until I saw that Gusto food truck parked on Tulane Avenue. I pay close attention to all the food trucks that line up for lunch weekly. What kind of foodie doesn't? And soon I realized that this was one I hadn't spotted before. Once I saw the menu, I was totallty in and ditched my sad meal prep of vegetables and lean meat. Listen, it was time to get gusto, baby.\n\nI love that they have a menu on their truck along with descriptions of what is in each dish in clear print. They also have an additional \"Today's Special\" menu, which boasts even more options.\n\nThe Cuban Sandwich was immediately on my radar to order. Homemade lecho (pork), ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard served on french bread? Count me in. And since I didn't want my new friend Cuban to be lonely, I ordered some empanadas so they could join the party. These Cuban-style meat pies can be filled with chicken or beef (I chose beef) and are served with crunchy plantain chips. The flavor of these two were crazy together. The Cuban is topped with these potato sticks that add an extra crispiness to the sandwich and the meat pies have a sauce on top that's so tasty.\n\nNot to mention, the portions are great for the price! My Cuban was $8 and for 4 beef empanadas, it was $5. They also serve beverages.\n\nOf course, my thirsty self was ready to hunt them down before my food was even ready and asked if they would be near Tulane Ave. more often; they said it's a possibility. Not to mention, the owners are super nice and friendly. We need that real Cuban flavor on the Ave, Gusto!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Very disappointed. I have been in the food and beverage industry for ten years and managed independent restaurants, banquet operations and hotel restaurants. \n\nAllow me to paint the picture for you of my experience on Saturday morning at 10am. My boyfriend and I walk into the restaurant to be greeted three different times by different servers since there was no hostess. As we wait for our table (understandable that there is a wait- brand new restaurant and it's Saturday morning) I notice that a booth with two women receive their food disappointed that it took too long and asked for a box to go. We get sat and order two coffees, a milk and two waters. The coffee and milk arrive. The waters took 10 minutes to make it to our table. I ordered the pancake combo (extremely excited to test out the sweet potato pancakes) and my boyfriend orders the steak and eggs. Thirty minutes into waiting for our order to arrive, I notice that a table of three guys who were in the restaurant before us still haven't received their order. That's when I begin to question what is happening in the back of the house (even though I can see that there are only two cooks in their open kitchen). I then overhear the blonde waitress behind the bar (I'm assuming she is chick one of two) telling a guest that her order was being made now because the printer keeps going offline and orders are not going through to the kitchen. Our waitress happens to come over and I ask if our order is almost ready because I have to be somewhere. She said we were next in line, she would go check and if I would like it boxed up. She comes back and says it would be another ten minutes so I tell her were leaving. At this point, the blonde owner behind the bar is aware of what just happened... She just lost two customers. Neither her nor the waitress made an attempt to recover what just happened. No apology or explanation or even an invitation back once they work out the kinks.\n\nI am not here to bash a new restaurant with an adorable vibe and farm to table focus serving our local vendors. Every new restaurant has kinks to work out. What I am going to bash is the poor service recovery and lack of customer service that should be at the forefront of a new business to ensure guests come back.","stars":1.0}

I love their club which is alway piled high with mouth watering turkey and a perfectly toasted bun. The one thing that has not changed-which is good, is the old fashion ice cream.

I have yet to find my therapeutic soul mate because the therapists are just that talented in their field. Nowadays it is hard to find people that genuinely care about their clients wherever you go, but from the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by lovely ladies at the front desk who acknowledge you and do the very best they can to fit your needs whether it be regarding the amount of pressure you want applied to your body, a scheduling conflict. Essentially, whatever you need, they will work it out with you and for you. As for the massage therapists, they have greeted me with warm smiles and a clear instruction on how each of them perform. They join you on your massage journey rather than just seeing you as a body that is bent out of shape. And every time I left? I felt like a new person ready to conquer the world!

The Island Escape was just one room with man made objects out of wood. \n\nWith that difference out of the way, it didn't detract from the fun and challenging time we all had.  They had lots of different puzzles and locks to figure out. Our host, Austin, was awesome.  He coached us \/ checked in when appropriate.

{"text":"This is a charming little Italian BYO on Girard near the El.  They have a prix fixe menu for $30, which gives you four small plates -- one antipasti, one pasta, one entree, and one dessert or salad of your choice.  You can also order each of these items a la carte, but the prix fixe is definitely the best deal.\n\nThe meal starts with an amuse bouche.  I'm not sure if it's always the same, but when I ate there this past week, it was a postage-stamp size square of bread with beets and ricotta.  They then serve bread with olive oil and ricotta.  \n\nI ate only vegetarian items here, but there are many meat\/fish options, including things like rabbit.  As an antipasti, I had the bruschetta, which were very nice - two slices were topped with beets and the other two with something sweet (figs? dates?  I can't really remember).  The pasta course was fantastic - I got the ravioli, which is stuffed with marscapone and covered in toasted almonds.  It was absolutely delicious and definitely the highlight of the meal.  For the entree, the vegetarian selection is eggplant parmesan (more or less).  I liked it but it didn't blow me away like the ravioli did, although I liked that the sauce included golden raisins.  For dessert, I had some sort of warm chocolate pudding, but I was too stuffed to eat much of it.  The meal ends with a free taste of sambuca.  Overall, the flavors in the dishes reminded me quite a bit of Osteria -- but at a fraction of the price.\n\nThe service is friendly and the restaurant's decor, while not particularly interesting, is warm and inviting.

My colleagues and I were regulars under the second owners (literally twice per week). Service was always great. Food was good. It was the place to be! The third owners came in and made some necessary (business) changes and only lasted a couple of months to my knowledge. This review is mainly on the current owners (or should I say management because I don't think they actually own the business). We went on a slow Tuesday. The food was mediocre. I was told blue cheese olives are an added cost (in a dirty martini)...in a not so polite manner. The bartender was asked about renting a space for an event. He told us they no longer do that, which is understandable but he said it matter of factly without mentions of anything else (they have an upstairs room). We asked for the manager so we could inquire about hosting an event--she did not come out until a message was relayed that we were unhappy (an overheard whisper from the bartender). She tried cleaning it up (explaining why they no longer rent out\/open the back space with the retractable roof) and mentioned upstairs is available. However, by this time the atmosphere was so unpleasant until I was certain I wasn't interested in anything else from them. We asked for our checks immediately. I could go on but long story short--I am no longer interested in business there. I don't know if these people are racist, elitist, lack customer service skills, something else, or all the above.

Bun not warm, bacon cooked well-well done, the burger wrong temp- well vs. medium.  I would have asked for correction, but I simply could not wait to leave.  There are many places in the area that will provide a better experience with much better food.  Unfortunately, Ted's has lost it's charm and flat not producing a good product.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Very expensive for taco's and burritos! The home made chips and queso are worth the stop for a snack. You order up front and you're given a number. We could have sat inside or out being there was seating for both available. We waited over 20 minutes for any of our food to come out. The meats in the tacos where flavorful but not what I would expect for a BBQ city like Nashville. The fish burrito was bland I felt. The little soft tacos could not hold up to the fillings, getting totally soggy and fell apart. The bright spot was the chips and queso. I would go back just for them, get a drink and sit out by the street.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"This place has a nice clean line to it when I walked in.  It took a while to see my server, Kyra, but she was nice and helpful in selecting between two appetizer dishes.  The mimosa took a while to come and she was very apologetic; however, I noticed that I was the only table without water and it remained that way my entire dining experience.  I enjoyed the crispness of the bacon on my stuffed dates.  It was the right blend of sweet and salty with the dates.  The sea scallops were broiled just right and I enjoyed them with the risotto that had just a hint of butter and salt.  I noticed that there was no salt or pepper on the table, not that I needed either.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp while just randomly looking for something adventurous to do. I have heard of something similar in poconos but driving from Philly to Poconos just for treetop quest was not something I intended to do, so I am so happy this place has opened up near Philly. \nAs soon I found out about it, I booked online reservations for the next day and it was extremely easy to find a spot and book online. You save $2 if you book online ($49) vs walking in ($51). These are the prices for adults over 18 years old and they have different prices for different ages. I didn't think $49 was expensive but it wasn't cheap either. We booked our reservations for 1pm, and we arrived a bit late and they had no issues with letting us in with the 1:30pm group. \n\nYou get to spend 2.5 hours there for 4 different levels of obstacles. 1,2A,2B, and 3 levels are mostly for kids and level 4 includes adults. Although level 4 doesn't really seem scary, it's just that the obstacles are just more higher up so if you're scared of heights, I don't recommend you do level 4. Level 4 ends with option of exiting before going through their most toughest obstacles or going though them. There was 4 obstacles at the end of the level 4, and these are the most challenging ones out of them all, so it's nice that you get an option if you wanna go through them or not. \n\nStaff is all young, and they are usually at the bottom center to guide you if you get stuck or have any questions. They will also yell at you if you're doing something wrong or acting stupid. They also encourage you and motivate you if you're scared. \n\nThe only annoying part was that once you start a level, you cannot exit out, or let others go ahead of you. We were lucky enough to not have anyone ahead of us or behind us so we were able to go at our own pace.","stars":5.0}

Short-rib was tender; however, the sauce was heavier than I expected, felt my pressure go up. Nonetheless I still enjoyed it. The arancini was nicely balanced--crunch on the outside with the savory inside. Furthermore the sauce that accompanied the arancini was refreshing and a nice accompaniment to the fried dish. I looked forward to the gnocchi, but unfortunately it wasn't executed properly. Instead of the gnocchi being the soft fresh potato pasta I expected it overcooked and soggy.\n\nService: 4 out of 5\nOur main server was sweet. Not sure why other people were bringing us out our food, which was incorrect. \n\nEnvironment: 5 Out of 5\nI appreciate the effort to separate guests and ensure folks felt more comfortable during the re-opening.

{"text":"I usually stick to local coffee shops to avoid chains like Starbucks because you can avoid the long lines and there are actually workspaces (kinda the whole point of coffee shops for me).

You wouldn't find this inside the city so I get to avoid street parking, limited parking, and time wasted looking for parking.\n2) No lines. There's a good crowd, but I never feel like I have to wait. I'm usually the next person from the moment I enter.\n3) Plentiful workspaces. There's a large community table, numerous bar and coffee tables, counter space, and couch\/ottoman table pairs.

{"text":"We finally decided to try out Wong's after being told by several people that they have the best takeout in the area. I had hoped they delivered but they do not so after a quick phone call and a five minute drive, I was picking up hot, fresh Chinese for an impromptu quick dinner. What I liked most about this place is that it is very, very clean, and the owners are very nice and are concerned about making a superior, quality product. \n\nEverything we ordered was different from what most people have gotten used to from a corner Chinese takeout place, and much of it was definitely homemade and made on-site. This is a great change from the majority of other places that just use frozen, pre-made stuff smothered in sauce to make it tasty.  We ordered wonton soup, shrimp egg rolls, steamed dumplings, and general tzo's chicken, and I was impressed by most of it. \n\nThe wonton soup was a bit salty but the wontons were wonderful!  Definitely made fresh and not prepared and frozen, and the egg rolls were nice and crispy, fresh and not greasy. The generals chicken was good, but sat above the sauce so we had to mix it and coat it all in a bowl before serving it, but I suspect this is because their sauce is made fresh and can get extremely spicy after several pieces. It's a refreshing change from the overly sweet sauce you usually find on that dish. The dumplings weren't anything that special, and it was a bit of a letdown after reading several reviews on here raving about them. \n\nOverall, we liked what we had ordered and will try Wong's again. If you are in search of tasty Chinese takeout and don't mind walking or taking a quick drive, this is totally worth a try.","stars":3.0}

They thought he was bit by another dog but couldn't say because apparently they weren't watching the dogs close enough at the time. Our lab had actually cut his leg on something very sharp and had to be stitched up. We gave the daycare another chance as they offered some free days to help cover the vet bill from the cut. A few months later, our dog was extremely sick with kennel cough and the beginning of pneumonia even though he had received the vaccine. When I called Hickory to explain that he would not be in for awhile, they responded with \"Yes, kennel cough was going around the kennels.\" We received no warning, no bulletin announcing that it was going around. We didn't even receive an apology that we had to go thru vet bills again. In less than a year of daycare, we paid $500 in vet bills because of Hickory's inattentiveness to the dogs and safety issues.

The food was delicious and very nicely presented.  We inconvenienced them once or twice with mis-ordering and dithering and they simply couldn't have been nicer.  Salads were lavish and pretty as well as scrumptious, kids' food was just right, appetizers generous and tasty, and one experienced member of our party deemed the Cubana sandwich better then any previously tasted anywhere, a pretty huge compliment.    We'd have liked it even more if the liquor license was in place, but with a wine source just a few doors down we couldn't complain, and the full license is just a week or two away.  The beer lovers were happy with the selection.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood -- family friendly and really quite delightful.","stars":5.0}

Decided to give this location closer to him another shot over the weekend, and I don't think I'll be going again.\n\nWay too many things were out of order. One of the limited number of stairclimbling machines was broken. The convenient bottle filling station wasn't operational. One of only three showers was also out of order. And even after I told them three weeks ago that the hair dryer in the men's locker room was not working, there isn't even a sign saying that it's out of order, so I assume they don't plan on fixing it anytime soon.\n\nThat leads to another issue. The staff seems completely disinterested in solving these issues. There were no apologies or anything. They just said okay, and I'm assuming they didn't write anything down in a maintenance log.\n\nI'm disappointed, but at least I can still take advantage of the much better location.","stars":2.0}

The owner said he had the same problem with another job and that it shouldn't have happened but he needed to figure out how to fix it.  He asked if I would be patient enough to wait 3-4 months to see if it got worse and that would give him a chance to also try to fix the last house with the same problem and make sure it works before trying the repair on mine too.  Well, what was I to say but sure.  \n\nHowever, I waited the 3-4 months and tried calling several times, only to never get return calls. Then my dad died and that was the last thing on my mind so I gave it a rest for two months while I mourned and dealt with his estate.  Moving on, I recently sent text a picture and was pleasantly surprised when he responded and told he would come out this week.  Unfortunately, I was once again dissapointed.

The variety of animals is extensive, with polar bears, giraffes, rhinos, tigers, and bears (oh my!), monkeys, meercats, on and on. It's a great place to spend the day and definitely check out the dolphin show (which is included in the ticket price), and the shark petting area (yes, you read that correctly). The shark petting area is actually one of my most favorite, just watching them can be entertaining. Then also the walrus likes to put on his own show once in a while. \n\nIn case you happen to go on a hot day, be sure to bring a change of clothes for the kids. There is a splash pad where they can go to cool down, a creative solution I think.. Maybe go to the splash pad after the petting area since, let's face it, some animals just smell, like, well animals. \n\nThen the more hidden but obvious gem would be the White River Gardens. It's included in the ticket price and you can see butterflies, wonderful flowers, and the grounds outside of the greenhouse are quite pretty and usually seem to be missed by many people since it's never very full. \n\nA day at this zoo is well worth it.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Here's the situation: when you get invited to fancy brunch, you go. When David's cousin asked us if we wanted to join her and a few other people for fancy Sunday jazz brunch at Arnaud's, I couldn't say \"yes!\" fast enough.\n\nI had never been to Arnaud's for brunch, but I knew that I was in for a memorable experience. We were seated in the big dining room and a small jazz band was making the rounds moving from table to table playing old favorites. The brunch menu is a prix fixe menu, and you get four courses. The price of your entree is the price you pay for everything.\n\nI started with the turtle soup. I LOVE turtle soup au sherry and Arnaud's version didn't disappoint at all. It was full of meat and quite tasty. This was a perfect way to start the meal. Next was the salad. This was a simple side salad that was a nice palate cleanser between meals. My entree was the Eggs Adrienne. This was poached eggs, grilled Louisiana country sausage on English muffins with Creole sauce. This dish was GREAT! The eggs were cooked perfectly and the sausage and sauce were to die for. This is the way a Creole breakfast should taste and I liked that I got a nice taste of Louisiana at brunch. The final course was dessert and I had the bread pudding. As someone who has gone most of her life avoiding bread pudding, I certainly have found myself sampling a lot of it lately. Arnaud's version is fantastic made with rum soaked raisins and served in a Bourbon sauce. It's really hard to go wrong with that.\n\nIt was David's cousins birthday and the band made her feel special by coming over and singing Happy Birthday to her. I love special touches like that. The atmosphere was very laid back and it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed a couple of mimosas and the brunch lasted for about 3 hours and the time just flew. The staff here really does a fantastic job of making sure that you have a memorable experience and we certainly did. Put this on your \"must\" list, whether you live in New Orleans or you are just visiting.","stars":5.0}

For dinner I was craving something really spicy and so I went with drunken noodles and my wife opted for rice with vegetables.  The drunken noodles were just the thing I was craving...and the spicyness too.  But beware the spice is not for the light hearted nor is it too hot if that's your thing.  My wife's dish was pretty good as well. \n\nFor dessert we got the mango ice cream and the only thing it had going for it was that it's homemade.

The crab had been cooked in scorched oil! And unfortunately the expiditer missed the missing dressing. Daughters mussels and andulle were cooked well but the sauce tasted like old bad memories of ragu. Tant pis!.\nHope sprang from the impending key lime and cooked key lime slices. The cooked was awesome! Fluffy and sweet. The standard, easy key lime slice was ghastly! The crust was raw flour and the combination of the raspberry (which was great on the cooked slice) with the cold version  tasted like floor cleaner had been an ingredient.

I'm in the printing industry and worse yet, I'm in color management. So I notice everything when it comes to color. My car is a cool gray. Grays vary a lot. They are hard to match.

We were warned that our meals could take up to 30 minutes due to it being busy, but in reality, our appetizers came out in 30 minutes, and our mains came out another 30 minutes later. I genuinely don't understand how the owners of this restaurant think it is okay to run a restaurant this way. Why should soup take 30 minutes to come to our table?? As for our actual meal, are you boiling one single small pot of water for each egg you poach? At one point, I looked around at the rest of the restaurant and only about 4 tables had their food. It started to get awkward when our coffee cups and juice cups were being cleared by the waitress and we *still* did not have our food. When our food finally arrived, we received an apology from the waitress for the delay, but.... I imagine she has to apologize all the time. A friend of mine ate here for dinner recently and they also stated it took one hour for their dinner to come out, and there was only about 3 tables full of people in the restaurant. What gives, Under The High Wheel?? I left feeling quite upset and like I wasted far too much time on a Sunday. I will say that the food was good, but certainly not worth an hour of waiting after being seated (then add in the 30 mins it took to even get a table).

The food here both pre-made and ready to eat again, the best mix of Italian and amazing whatever they have today.  \n\nThis store is different for me because of the cool little cafe inside, the bread, desserts and wine\/beer section.  \n\nThey just are a class act.

{"text":"My husband and I love going to the Hard Rock Casino in Tampa.  We are slot players and we can play for hours.  Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose....we probably lose more than win.  We go quite a bit and you have to keep in mind how much you are willing to spend.  Usually we go with about as much as we would spend on dinner, drinks and a movie.  We try to play penny machines.  You have to be careful, because some penny machines are $4.00 a bet.\nThe comps aren't the greatest.  We get great comps from Harrahs, when we travel...but, the Florida hard rocks give almost nothing.  For going so much, you'd think we'd be getting great comps.  Not a chance. That would be my only complaint, which as far as casinos go, it is a good complaint.  They are the only game in town, so I guess the lack of competition keeps the comps down. \nOnly the soft drinks are free, you have to pay for alcoholic drinks.  While this isn't the greatest, at least you get a decent drink.  \nThey have lots of entertainment and excitement. \nThere is the Fresh Harvest, which is a buffet.  The food is very good.  The Sushi Bar, which is separate is excellent.  The Council Oak is a steak place, very $$$ and I don't think it's worth it at all.  The Green Room is a sit down place and the food is good.  The Hard Rock Cafe has good burgers.  The Food Court is great.  Someone said it was gross....no, not even close.  Their pizza is awesome.  I am from NY and I love their pie!  The hamburgers are good too.  They aren't the greatest and I am picky, but when you are hungry they taste great.  \nThe rooms are just beautiful.  Big beds with down comforters...glitz in the bathrooms...and if you get comped with an upgrade...sweet.  You can't lose on the rooms. \nSomeone wrote about the bathrooms........al super, duper clean...they each have someone in there at all times cleaning up.  Everyone that works at the casino are extremely nice...they all say hello and smile.   I did have one waitress who was ticked off that I didn't give her a dollar for the coke...I felt bad and told her so, but she looked pretty mad.  The cokes are free, they expect a dollar.  If you are playing and your money is in the machine, then they shouldn't be rude.  She was incredibly rude...but, then again, I always tip the dollar....that time, I just didn't have it. \nYes, there is smoking.  There is tons and tons and tons of smoking.  Someone sitting right next to you puffing away.  If this offends you, don't sit down next to a smoker.  Not everyone is smoking, but keep it in mind.  Some people go with face masks on...I saw one woman lean as far as she could and was covering her mouth with her hand..........really?  Just move on.  I always think, who is there first gets the say.  So, if the smoker is there puffing away, don't sit next to them and expect them to stop for you.  The same goes the other way.  It's never a problem for us.....but, to some people it is.  So just know, there's smoking, it's allowed and if you go, there is plenty of it, so don't moan. \nOverall we love the excitement.  We are locals, so we know which machines usually pay or pay higher than others.  We usually head straight for those.  If you go super early in the morning, before 10 am, the place is yours.  After 10 am, all the buses come with the senior citizens.  Then the place is packed.  They leave around five, so the place is clear again.  Around 7 or 8 the place is hopping again, every night, every day.  It usually clears out again around 1am to 2am.  By clear, I mean you have a bit more selection of machines.  \nAlso, the place is massive!  Make sure you plan a place to meet up, if you seperate from friends.  Overall, enjoy the lights, the energy, the music....and I hope you win a little....if not,,,,,then just enjoy yourself and don't over spend. :)","stars":5.0}

This was a half step less that giving everyone the middle finger as they waited for their food. It was also horribly expensive.

However, I am a firm believer that if it takes a while for the food to be delivered, the taste should be justifiable. Let me tell you - as soon as I took the first bite of what I ordered, it was delectable and well worth the wait! Additionally, I found the price to be really cheap for the large portions of food you get. Four people attempted to eat two platters. We almost finished, but it was so filling that we just could not!\n\nI ordered the Gobbledown Platter and Double-Up Platter. The smoked wings are possibly the best I've had. The smoky flavor is out of this world, and the inside of the wings are not dry. I can enjoy them with or without sauce. As for the turkey ribs, there was quite a lot of meat in each one and they were quite tender. They pair nicely with the smoky BBQ sauce. I actually didn't care for the turkey tips much, as they had more fat than I prefer on my meat. The leaner pieces that I did eat, however, were still pretty good. The sides of coleslaw were decent. I was supposed to get 3 sides total with all that I ordered but I only got 2. By the time I got home, they were already closed. However, I called back the next day and they were kind and apologetic, and will give me credit for that side the next time I order. That's all I ask for so I'm pleased!\n\nOverall, this was a pleasant experience leaving my wallet and stomach happy. As a first timer here, I have become a fan of this place and will make my way here again in the near future.","stars":4.0}

As for the cheese, I went with the classic (I had them add jalape\u00f1os = delicious!) along with the roasted tomato soup. The best test is on the basics and they passed! Both my grilled cheese and soup were delicious. It was enough food to be both my lunch and dinner. The soup wasn't super chunky like others have said (after all it is roasted tomato soup not a bisque!) Overall I was really happy with my meal!\n\nWhy didn't they get four stars or five stars?

They're not \"out of this world, crazy good, gotta have em\" but they're solid and they will satisfy your wing craving should one arise.\nThe place has kind of a college happy hour feel to it (my iced tea arrived in a large plastic cup) which is fine as long as the happy hour patrons aren't there when I'm there.

{"text":"For many years I enjoyed Albertson's for certain offerings.  Then Wal-Mart and Target creeped into our area with their new grocery sections and Albertson's got almost totally squeezed out.\n\nIt's a shame it was not Kash 'n Karry\/Sweetbay!  They tried to adapt, but eventually failed and have now merged with Winn Dixie, leaving us with far less grocery shopping options in Pinellas than previous years.\n\nThen a few years ago I discovered 2 Albertson's still exist nearby!\n\nSo I make the occasional West Ulmerton drive to get those rare gems that made Albertson's GREAT!\n\nLet's get the bad out first...  All of their produce is overpriced, even more expensive than Publix.  Best off to just avoid this section entirely, but I always wonder why this is so?  \n\nThe rest of their dairy, frozen, or \"middle aisle,\" processed foods are like most all markets, meaning...  If not buying BOGO or with a coupon, expect to pay full price.\n\nAs for \"Why the WOW Here?\"  Both the deli and bakery areas are great!  Both always have genuine deals and more importantly, selections not seen elsewhere.\n\nThe real kicker is their FRESH meat\/seafood counter!  I almost hesitate to share...  (I don't want to wait in line any longer!).\n\nYou can get the best fresh fish, shrimp, or crab legs here.  Publix most often charges almost double.  Avid home cooks should visit here at least once!\n\nFinally...  It is their freshly ground beef that hooked me.  That stuff out of their fresh counter is even better than Publix's Greenwise.\n\nSo whether it is just for meatloaf, sloppy joe's, Italian meat sauce, Tex-Mex tacos, or just a humble, home-cooked hamburger?  It has a real BEEF flavor.  All else nearby is just not as great.\n\nIt's that very special Albertson's meat counter that keeps me coming back!\n\nAnd just one final hint.....  That soaked \"7-Up Yellow Bundt Cake\" in the chilled bakery case?\n\nYES!  It is all you imagine and then some!\n\nOk...

My meal also came with some mixed greens salad, but it salty (who puts salt on a salad -- even still who puts THAT much salt on a salad)\n\nMy wife got the Garden Benedict and while again the makings of a great meal were there, the inside of her egg was cold. (Meaning that they probably cook their eggs en masse and store them in ice water only to reheat them when order. For the price, I would expect them to make each entree to order, but I guess not? \n\nOn another mixed note, we both got pour over coffees. (It should be noted I can be a bit of a coffee snob) I asked our waiter for the kinds of pour-overs on rotation and she didn't remember them all off hand and didn't have the tasting notes for them either when she came back.

After reading all the reviews, I discovered there weren't too many great reviews.  Oh well .... we've been there and done that now and there's little chance we would return.\n\nFive of us ordered the corned beef and cabbage special.  We've had plenty of corned beef at many Irish restaurants in the past plus cooked our own. It's one of our favorite Irish dinners.   The corned beef has been almost always cut thicker, more on your plate, juicy and delicious. I've got to say this was absolutely the worst corned beef my husband and I have ever had.\n\nI thought the carrots, potatoes and cabbage were very good.  However, the corned beef was skimpy, cold, over cooked, dry and nearly tasteless.   It was cut about as thick as a piece of paper.  Thus, with it being so thin, there was no flavor left in it.

{"text":"This place was a lot of fun. I was very wary because \"choose a meat, then a sauce\" restaurants are usually a disappointment. But I can never resist a novelty. Happily, we thought the broths were terrific! Another reviewer complained about the sauce being bland and flavorless. I couldn't disagree more. We thought our broths - and all the rest of the food - were fantastic.\n\nI got the tom yum seafood and He got the szechuan fish \"meat up.\" We both really enjoyed our broths and my seafood was very fresh and lovely. He didn't realize that szechuan sauce is spicy and he didn't realize that by, \"fish,\" they really meant nothing more than some unknown white fish. Silly rabbit. Fortunately he enjoyed his very much and I actually had enough shellfish to throw some his way.\n\nWe did find the place very loud but that wasn't too big of a surprise for a place very popular w\/ Asian students from UCSB. There was a lot of happy yakking and hanging out. A whole group of students were playing a video game on their phones w\/ each other and the young woman next to me wouldn't stop gabbing on her phone the whole time she ate.  Poor bloke on the line must have been going, \"uh huh...uh huh...uh huh...\" the whole time. So don't go there expecting a quiet date night environment. Fortunately we weren't surprised or bothered.\n\nMinor gripes: the fuel was a little stinky when I leaned too close to the cooker. We were relieved to finally have our cookers extinguished. Also, the cookers raise the bowls up pretty high so that unless you're tall, it's a little awkward (which is why I was leaning in and getting a face-full of fumes).\n\nBig gripe: the Universal Seafood is supposed to include crab legs, but they're really just Krab (surimi) - you know, the pink slime of fish, extruded into shapes and then dyed and artificially flavored. That's fine, I'm not a total hater of the stuff, but if that's what you're serving, DON'T CALL IT CRAB LEGS because it's NOT CRAB LEGS! Call it Krab and maybe offer real crab as a more expensive add-on.\n\nFinal gripe: \"Uniboil\" is a horrible name! It sounds like something you really should see a doctor about. That mural on the wall is terrific - try to find a name that captures that sensibility. Maybe call it just, \"Simmer.\" Or, \"Steam.\" Or, \"Sizzle.\" Those words tell you what to expect and sound a little sexy at the same time.  \n\nFinal tip: Ignore all the photos people took of the AYCE menu options.  That was just a promotion they had at Thanksgiving. The menu is pretty straightforward: 1) choose a broth; 2) choose a meat; 3) choose noodles or rice; 4) add extras if you want them. We showed up very hungry, did not have any add-ons, and left a lot of food behind because there was way more than enough. \n\nSo think twice before ordering add-ons! In fact, there was so much broth that you could order add-ons to throw into your leftover container right before packing it up to take home. I'm not sure why people were bitching about prices. My $16 seafood bowl could have fed me for a few more meals if I had been inclined to take the broth home and throw some more stuff into it. Cheapskates like that are the reason our standards and expectations keep getting lower and lower every year!\n\nOverall, we loved the place and I look forward to returning again.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Make sure you check your account when you leave! I went to 308 last Friday to meet a friend who was in from out of town. I ordered an $8 glass of wine and my friend ordered a mixed drink that our server recommended. Hers tasted awful and so she didn't even drink it. No one else at the table wanted it either so she wasted her $9. My glass of wine was not even close to a full pour. In the group I was with, there were at least 5 current or former bartenders and servers. I asked them if I was crazy to think that it was a really small pour and they all agreed that it was at least an ounce if not more short. I'm no lush, but when I'm paying $8 for a glass of average wine, I'd at least like the full pour. When our server finally came back by I asked him if it was a full pour and he said \"no, it is usually up to here\" (and put his finger on the glass).. he just paused and looked at me and I said \"well i haven't had any to drink yet\".. he just said \"ok\" and walked off, not offering to fill it up or fix anything. I had also given him my card to hold, but told him in advance I wanted to pay cash. He said that was fine, but he just had to have my card. So after the 1 drink that I had,I asked for my check. He brought it (not appearing to have run it), and I gave him $9 cash (I probably shouldn't have even tipped $1 for the crummy service). When I checked my bank account a few days later, there were 2 charges from 308. One charge for $10 and another for $11. So now I'm having to go through the trouble of filling out an affadavit with my bank since NEITHER of those charges should be on there because I paid cash!

My friend got the Shepard's Pie...it was very good as well but he wanted a roll with it.  They gave him a roll but charged him a dollar for it....which I thought wasn't very cool. \nI visited for lunch a couple of days ago for a pint.  Me and my co-worker sat inside and I love the decor and feel of the place.  It does smell quite musty stale cigarette like but it is a bar! I got the Scotch Eggs and a nice Killian's.

{"text":"Oh, this place has potential. \n\nThe baked goods are delicious, the service is not excellent, and the business owners don't seem interested in improving what they are providing. \n\nAfter confusion about who to give my order to, I reached the register. I told the young man at the register that I would like whichever of the soups was vegetarian. He rang me up. When my food was delivered at the table, I specifically asked if the soup was vegetarian. Two women who delivered the food said it was.\n\nIt was not. They served a vegetarian chicken soup even after being specifically asked about it. \n\nI sent the soup back, and then had my meal interrupted an additional 2-3 times by their employees. Because their mistake necessitates them interrupting my meal to unpleasantly pseudo-apologize.\n\nSome excuses given:\n\"We have a lot of new girls working here.\" (I gave my order to a man.) (Also, you told me the soup was vegetarian when you delivered it)\n\"We ran out of the soup so we substituted another.\"  At this point I replied that I would have understood it if the cashier had told me that they were out of the vegetarian soup. \n\nI understand mistakes happen in food service, but the buck needs to stop somewhere. It's not okay to serve people food they have been specifically asked not to. I would not recommend trusting this restaurant with a food allergy or sensitivity problem. \n\nI hope this bakery can step up to the plate.","stars":2.0}

Hot sauce suggestions to optimize flavors was spot on! I was skeptical of the Habanero salsa but it was excellent. My shrimp tacos were the best I've ever eaten. Fresh shrimp crisply cooked with a Mexican coleslaw and pico de Gallo that melded their flavors perfectly.\nMy wife had Camarones Cuchilli with a poblano pepper and cheese sauce that worked with generous serving of shrimp.

{"text":"It was our last night in New Orleans and I felt like a walk down Bourbon St. was in order. I had already eaten some great food during my stay but wanted a last taste of some local Cajun cuisine so found Le Bayou on Yelp. \nThe place is decorated in a New Orleans tourist motif, which isn't a bad thing but made me feel a little concerned about the rest of the meal, especially the spices. Our waitress took a few minutes to get to us, but the wait was worth it. She was so friendly and immediately put on the southern charm and hospitality like she had just invited us into her own kitchen. We started with the Shrimp Ya-Ya, which is a delicious shrimp in pesto sauce with crispy garlic toast pieces appetizer. For my entree, I ordered the blackened redfish and was very happy. The seasoning was just right and the fish was tasty and light. By the time I finished, I wished I had more, but overall it was a good portion.\nSeveral times through the meal, our waitress stopped by to make sure we were okay. It wasn't artificial hospitality, but the real thing. While she had many other tables on this busy night, we felt like we were her biggest concern. That added a star and a nice memory of our last dinner in NOLA.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"The folks at Saxbys in Ambler hit the ground running last fall and haven't looked back. Some of the inevitable bumps along the way have been described earlier in other reviews, but seem to have been more than adequately accounted for by the owners and the staff are always improving. \n\nThe drive thru is a nice little novelty in this coffee shop's repertoire of services and accommodations. While some reviewers complained of a long wait for a simple order, I have had no unexpected problems frequenting it at various times of the day. Food here is made to order and drinks are carefully crafted to the customer's liking. Between the attention to detail that's required for a good product and the moderate to high volume of customers in line in the drive thru and inside at many times, the wait is more than reasonable. Starbucks locations with a drive thru have very comparable wait times- not sure why others were so surprised. This isn't a Dunkin Donuts or a fast food joint, after all. Bonus points for the dog biscuits they have inside the window for your pup!\n\nThe brewed coffee is good with a few roasts available at a time and the cold brew is smooth and tasty. The baked goods can sometimes be a bit dried out if they sit for a few hours, but don't hesitate to ask if they have any stored in the back for a fresher treat (my favorite is the lemon loaf). The sandwiches and salads are a bit on the pricier side, but are worth the money. The chicken avocado on ciabatta is delicious!  Another note of importance is that the staff are usually very friendly and accommodate customers with a smile on their face, even during a rush. The food, drinks, and service all come together to make for a great experience.\n\nThere are lots of outlets at this Saxbys and there is a variety of seating, so it's a great environment for catching up with a friend, doing some work, or having a small meeting. This location has consistently been fairly clean and tidy, as well.\n\nOverall, not a bad spot. It certainly outdoes some of the other Saxbys locations I've visited, although there is always room for improvement. I wish they were open later, if anything. Saxbys Ambler is definitely worth a try nevertheless!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Great spot for authentic German cuisine and a vast selection of Beers, Bierstube is definitely a spot I would recommend for a beer lover, a great night out with the fellas, or a nice spot as I used it for a Father's Day dinner!\n\nAtmosphere - Dark wood surfaces and German styled art deco pictures and painting adorn the walls of Bierstube. From the enormous beer list, a plethora of beer serving and tasting glasses can be found behind the bar for the beer lover you're going with. A few small TV's adorn the bar to show local sporting events or in our case, the World Cup, which had a few happy visitors there watching the game.\n\nWaitstaff - Our waiter was very good at recommending some great things to try (more on that soon), but the best idea he gave us was upgrading to the liter glasses of beer. Holy moly was I glad I was staying downtown for a while after dining here, definitely worth the price, but you will get a lot of beer so be prepared! Was very good about staggering appetizers vs. meals and catering to my dad's needs during our dining experience.\n\nFood - Right on point for what you would think for a German beer garden. We started carb loading with some German pretzels with a spicy brown mustard and cheese dip which was really good. Fresh, warm pretzels helped us enjoy our beers even better. We also got some french fries with a traditional beer deep sauce which were good, but I would have preferred another order of the pretzels. For dinner, my dad got the mushroom spaetzel, which was he said was really good, especially using the truffle oil in the fix made it really light and delicious. I went with a BBQ Pulled Pork flatbread. Much heartier then traditional flatbreads, came with thick chunks of pulled pork and a very savory BBQ sauce. Well worth the prices which were dramatically cheaper then I thought they would be for the quality you have down here.\n\nIntangibles - Right off of 2nd & Market, there's a lot of competition for your dining dollars down here. I didn't see any kind of dress code down here so be warned that some folks off the street coming in may not meet a 'dining' standard. Had to leave my seat at the bar before the meal as one gentleman spent a bit too much time out in the sun and smelled of it. \n\nOverall - Bierstube is a can't miss spot for dining if you enjoy German food. They menu is not as a big as the beer list, but if you're in the mood for an affordable great place to try, this would be one spot I would recommend highly in Olde City.","stars":4.0}

Maybe I'm spoiled by their excellent service (and they know me and know my order so maybe I'm just plain partial!), but this location has pretty slow service.  We were seated for several minutes before someone approached us with chips and salsa and took our drink order.\n\nAfter that however, things were fine.  The food was great (try the white queso dip!) and the experience enjoyable.  I love their soft chicken tacos, but I've never heard anyone say a bad word about their food when I was with them.

{"text":"Having never stepped foot in Reno, I was brought to the Peppermill frankly because I had a voucher that I purchased a year ago and it was set to expire by the end of December. From the website, the place looks impressive, even a bit majestic. In reality, the outside looks a little outdated (just like the rest of Reno), but more on that a later. I arrived there with my girlfriend and did self check-in. The kiosk makes check-in simple and soon after we were on our way up to our suite in the Tuscany tower. The room was a King Suite with, obviously, a king size bed, 42\" LCD TV, and the usual accoutrements you find in a hotel (Gideon Bible: check).\n\nLet me get the only critique I have about this place out of the way: There are several parts of this resort that are aesthetically outdated. The contrast is marked when you compare this to the newer Tuscany Tower. However, this miniscule eyesore succumbs to the list of positive attributes Peppermill offers.\n\nThis Hotel\/Spa\/Casino has everything you expect in a four-diamond resort. Romanza leads the pack by offering excellent Italian fine dinning. Spa Toscana expands three separate floors and offers guests the opportunity to receive a decent massage or just lounge in their fourth floor caldarium. There are plenty of slots, tables, and a poker room. For the health conscious (like me) Peppermill has a fitness center located on the first floor of the Tuscany Tower replete with the usual cardio and weight equipment you can find at any decent gym. At the check-in counter, they have an attendant that provides a clean towel, bottled water, and, if desired, headphones for the treadmill. At night, there are several happy hour events that occur along with Edge Nightclub offering a great club experience.\n\nEvery staff member I encountered was helpful, courteous, and professional. This spans for each inner establishment I mentioned above to the valet and the cocktail waitresses at the casino. Check-out was a breeze and valet was courteous in offering guidance on any inquiry.

{"text":"Found another independent business in Mt. Juliet where I can get a cup of coffee and sit down and work on good, free wifi. I've driven past this place a few different times but never really thought about it having coffee and wifi since it was just a donut shop. I recently pulled into the parking lot to turn around though and noticed a wifi sticker on their door and that they had expanded with more seating (not sure when that occurred). \n\nSo, today I came in to give them a try. I got a couple of donuts to serve as my breakfast and lunch and a large coffee. \n\nService was super friendly and very helpful. Nothing too extravagant for coffee, but they do have a variety of complimentary coffee creamers and free refills. Sometimes that's all you need, especially when you want to try and avoid the normal $4-5 for a coffee drink at other places. The donuts were tasty as well. A nice combo.\n\nWhile I was checking out though I noticed they also have hand-dipped ice-cream options with a variety of topics for you to add to your scoops. They also make made-to-order deli sandwiches with a variety of meats, breads, cheese and toppings. Another plus in my book if you're planning on staying awhile.\n\nThe wifi speeds were really good as well. Far better than you're normally going to get at your local chain brand like Starbucks or Panera. 22+Mbps down and 10+Mbps upload speeds. The tables and chairs are pretty standard and commercial grade, lacking in atmosphere from your other coffee shops, but fine just the same.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to work, give these folks a try. I enjoy supporting local, independent mom & pop places whenever possible. And remember, if you're going to go into an establishment and spend some time using their table and wifi, be sure and support them by buying more than the minimum. Show them thanks by supporting their business.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"First of all, we thought the alligator sausage was fantastic.  Unfortunately this was the only highlight for us.  We went here, based on the great reviews, while we visited New Orleans.  The worst part about this place was the service.  The workers seemed to feel entitled, especially the bartender with a mohawk.  We sat at the bar and this bartender gave us horrible service.  There were only five us in the bar.  When asked what was on draft, he didn't even know.  Even though they only have four beers on draft.  He was very pompous and arrogant while taking our first order.  It took him around 20 minutes to make our drinks which was only a beer and their house punch.  The alligator sausage arrived relatively fast and was delivered by the kitchen.  Again, this tasted fantastic.  But after finishing our drinks before the alligator sausage was finished, we sat, and waited, and waited, and waited some more for our drinks to be refilled or at least asked if we needed another.  We came here to drink.  We weren't able to as the mohawked bartender refused to even look at us.  After around 20 minutes of sitting there with empty drinks and an empty plate, we were finally asked in a very pompous way if we needed anything else.  Of course we needed more drinks, but by this time, we were highly annoyed by the service so we asked for our check which took no time to get.  He was very fast with getting paid.  Funny how that works.  \n\nOverall, we wouldn't return based on the service that we received at the bar and the general attitude of the service staff.  You'd think they'd want a good tip but apparently the wait staff is already wealthy.  Hope you have better luck if you go to SoBou.","stars":3.0}

In the past we were at least able to speak with someone over the phone but on this day, it would hang up each time. I'm driving during to the family emergency so I'm unable to go on their website. In the past they have called me back if they were experiencing phone issues. No call back. I receive an email that I've been charged FULL PRICE for a Brazilian and under arm wax! That's $75! It's about the principle. I've been a loyal customer even through COVID so for them to just completely ignore me is ridiculous. I have emailed MULTIPLE TIMES since that day and they have not responded. They did the same thing to my God-mother and didn't respond until she wrote a nasty review! I'm honestly sick of it. On top of that one of their employees manually entered my God-mother's card information to charge her for services she didn't even book. Plus she was out of town when it happened!

This place is amazing, and for healthy eating (whether a vegan or paleo lifestyle), this is the place for you. For the paleo dishes they use either olive oil or coconut oil, and the dishes they have created so far are really delightful. They are very accommodating in letting you know the ingredients for every dish, so for those with sensitivities, it's a heaven site in our little city.

Me & my wife overheard a conversation one of the girls was having with a customer. The young girl said, \"She makes us split tips with her. I don't know why if she makes more money than us\".

I've tried calling, but no one answers the phone there. Every time I go there, that old lady is always involved in some kind of confrontation with a customer. Is it really all the other customers that is the problem or is it maybe just her? She makes enemies with customers and also the employees. Wow, what a way to live life. I saw a customer's post on Facebook (picture below). How many customers are going to be left if you purposely piss off every single person that comes in? How dare she yell at the poor employee.

{"text":"I was invited to dinner at Napoli Villa for Christmas Eve.  It lies within downtown Beech Grove in a pretty building.  This was my first visit. \n \nWe were seated right away, even though it turned out we were a bit early.  Despite the nice look of the restaurant, the noise level was immediately irritating and got worse through the night.  I had a headache by the time we left.  There just aren't enough soft furnishings to absorb all the chatter.\n  \nI was uncomfortable with the table height, as it seemed quite low compared to my chair.  We were crammed close to another table and I could barely hear myself speak let alone the people who sat next to me.\n\nThe service was pretty good, despite the server forgetting a couple of items, but it was quite busy.  She did bring us drinks as soon as we were seated.    I would have preferred a draft, but the canned Wee Mac I ordered was good.  I was given a frosted glass to go with it.  The warm bread on the table was delicious.  I only wish they had brought more out, not that I really had room for it.  I would have made room for another slice though.  It was certainly freshly baked.\n\nThe rest of our party all had the antipasto salad served family style, but I along with one other family member had the garden salad.  It was okay, but mostly large chunks of Iceberg.  It was nothing to write home about.   I had a bite of the Caprese salad as well, and it was \"meh.\"\n\nOther than the noise, the most disappointing part of the experience was my entr\u00e9e.  I regrettably ordered the penne alla vodka.  I didn't think much of it at the time I ordered, but the server asked if I had a heat preference: mild, medium, or hot.  I asked for medium, but that is certainly not what I received.  It was so hot that I considered sending it back.  I regrettably kept it hoping it would grow on me.  It was awful.  \n\nNow I am a person who usually eats Indian food.  Usually, when I request \"medium\" at a place like that, it is too mild.  I never would have expected this amount of heat in an Italian dish.  The side of mushrooms I ordered didn't really seem to go with this.  They were drowned in butter.  I'm not certain if it was the salad, the pasta, the mushrooms, or a combination, but my stomach was turning by the time we left.   I only suspected the salad because the same family member who had the same salad I had was doubled over in the parking lot before I had even gotten in the car.  \n\nAt one point, I was headed out to smoke and an employee, perhaps a hostess, said, \"Where are you going?\"  It turned out she was making sure I wasn't going the wrong direction to the restroom.  I think she had good intentions, but the way she addressed me took me aback a bit. Incidentally, the restroom was very small.  Someone that came in while I was leaving the facilities commented they were surprised they were able to fit two stalls in the ladies' room.\n\nI feel terrible because I really wanted to like this place.  I know my family enjoy it and paid good money for all of us to have a nice time.  Between the noise and the flaming hot food, I was nauseated, and my head was rattled.  Nothing I had felt authentically Italian to me.  I somewhat enjoyed visiting with my family when I could hear what they were saying, but I could not wait to get out of there.  I don't think I would jump at the chance to return.  I would have to be much more careful choosing a meal and would hope to go at a quieter time.","stars":2.0}

The biggest thing missing in my mind were the coolers packed full of fresh produce, which to me was a signal of so many things and translated into a strong perception of freshness when looking at the food.\n\nThe second thing that jumped out at this location was the empty hot line, and on top of empty, the dishes in the case didn't exactly look like they were just put out. I know some sell out fast, but I've always known PE to always be on top of this, making sure when one goes out another is dropped in almost simultaneously. \n\nLastly, observing the staff for a minute, it was pretty obvious they weren't communicating at all, and that's likely part of what caused the issues in the case. The first person to contact guests in the restaurant also wasn't exactly friendly either, and that set the tone for the whole deal. \n\nIt's funny, my wife suggested we use the drive-thru and I told her part of the fun is seeing all the fresh food in the case and watching your plate be put together. Had we used the drive-thru we would have been sitting there waiting for the food to be made, and I can't imagine how long those that were there had to wait.\n\nI ended up making some selections I wouldn't otherwise have due to the limited availablity, and all in all, the food was good, but not what I have secretly craved in the past.\n\nSo to make this long story short, this place needs training bad. I want to love it, but at this point I'll gladly drive the extra distance to the other to avoid this experience.\n\nPlease Panda Express, come to their rescue.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Really great coffee, not as great seating, but if you can find a table it's a great funky atmosphere. They're coffee purists here--as is the trend--and I'm a big fan of their product. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to get a seat when I've come (maybe I just pick busy times?) which makes it a bit of a difficult place for something like a friend meet up. \n\nI love the concept. I love the location. I love the storefront space it uses. I even love the idea of the cowork space they have (by subscription) on the side--and would probably be on that side constantly if I lived closer. But I don't love how the seating always feels like survival of the fittest, fighting for a spot and feeling like I shouldn't spend hours there--the thing I'm looking for in a coffee shop usually. \n\nI'll be back for a caffeine fix for sure, but I really wish they had more seating.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This is my first time Brio and my immediate thoughts are it's not inviting enough with a sufficient ambience of an Italian restaurant. There was no music initially the waitress then noticed also and put some music on. The immediate appetizers were calamari and bread, the bread came with butter and not actual vinegar and oil the calamari came with fried peppers and I believe there were more peppers than calamari the white sauce negative. Now the main meal has come forth, And let me tell you, the lamb chops are amazing double cut did not skimp on the lamb chops at all very tasty!!! mashed potatoes and asparagus perfect and the ultimate caramel cheesecake is fabulous.... my favorite part of the night but hey I'm a fat girl foodie so of course I'm gonna love the cheesecake. The strawberry margarita which you can see in past posts I've had issues with tonight it was perfect, it was one of the best strawberry margaritas I had right below cheesecake factory.. All in all the server Lindsay was very accommodating and on top of things. She's great. Give her a raise. Will be back.

I think I saw four weddings while there -- from a very small one to a larger one and a few medium in-between.  Can see how this would be the perfect place to tie the knot!\n\nThe rooms are on the small side, but decorated in a beach theme in white and shades of blue, green, yellow.  Like the boutique shops on the first floor, but buy your bathing suite somewhere else.  A little on the resort high side.\n\nThe lobby area bar is so nice.  Open air, so easy to hang out if you're on your own.  Also really like the patio dining area.  Fresh, healthy options which were very tasty and not as expensive as one would expect at a beachside resort hotel.\n\nNice location, too, in that you can drive to Sarasota about an hour away or go to downtown St. Pete.  So some nice day or half-day trips if you want to check out some other things.  But it was really hard for me to stay away from the beach!\n\nFor the most part, a friendly staff.

Not all the ingredients are common to typical American dining but are paired together well for a delicious, light and nutritious meal. \nAlso, they take pride in their craft cocktails.

The dogs had full run of the back of an SUV with the seats down. Ruben and Marco did really well with our babies! Since we were driving up on the same day, we had a group text chat going. Ruben shared his location so that we would know exactly where the babies were at all times. Marco sent us multiple photos throughout the day showing that the dogs were safe and happy (they love car rides and making new friends!). Before the move communication with Happy Tails was positive, proactive, and honest. Overall Happy Tails made the stressful experience of moving across the country a much happier experience.

{"text":"Overall very good breakfast experience at this location.  We stayed at the Gaylord Opryland for two nights and ate breakfast buffet for two mornings here.  Besides some coffee shops with pastries, Cascade American Cafe is the only place open for breakfast early.  \n\nService is excellent though obviously there's certain individual differences among the servers.  For instance, our server for the first morning was very proactive making sure we were taken care of, frequented our table and even offered some hot drinks to go.  However, the other server mainly waited until we asked him to take care of our needs. For $25.00 breakfast buffet, you'd expect everything to be excellent including service.\n\nFood was very good--my wife didn't like the waffles since they were pretty  tough.  They might have been sitting there for a while since it opens for business at 0630 and we went there around 0715.  Omelette was excellent for me.  Fresh fruit selection was very good though cantaloupe was not very ripe and tasteless.  \n\nWhat is worth here is the atmosphere itself.  Listening to the waterfall and being surrounded by greenery and flowers gave you a very calm feeling for the start of the day.  What it lacks in certain food quality, it may make it up with great ambiance, then you don't feel like you are totally ripped off by the stiff price.  \n\nIf you stay in G-O, you should try the breakfast buffet at least once.

Located in the heart of the city, it is similar to other capitols that look similar to the United States Capitol in Washington. Indiana was the 19th State to enter the Union, joining on December 11, 1816.\n\nThis current building is the fifth structure (the fourth in Indianapolis - bonus points if you know where the first capitol was located) and was completed in 1888. It is shaped like a cross with executive branch offices on the first floor, the House of Representatives on the second floor's west east side, the State Senate on the second floor's east side and the Supreme Court offices on the second floor's north end. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.\n\nUnfortunately, the building is closed to visitors at this time but you can still walk the outside. On the property, you'll find a statue of Oliver Morton (governor of Indiana during the Civil War), a statue of Thomas A Hendricks (21st Vice President of the United States under Grover Cleveland), a bust of Christopher Columbus and a statue of George Washington.

{"text":"On May 27th 2009, I along with my sister decided to join Urban Active. Since my sister was once a member of this company, she was experienced enough to tell the urban active representative that we did not want to sign a contract and we wanted to have an option of canceling our membership any time we wished. So the representative agreed and showed me the agreement without telling me that it was a 24 months contract and asked me to sign it. It seemed strange because I didn't even get the chance to read the contract as a result of him rushing us thru the signing up process. He tricked me into signing a 24 months contract without letting me know. What he did was obviously a fraud. Later on we found out from the employee at Urban active located in Nolensville Rd in Nashville that I was not the only victim of this fraud and this individual has tricked many people into signing a 24 month contracts.\n \nOn July 2009 after about 3 months using the facility I was going to California for a visit and I wanted to cancel my membership. Urban active managers told me I had 2 options: either to pay $250 to get out of the contract or to pay $10 each month to put my account on hold. So I had no choice but to pay $10.00 to put my account on hold. So meanwhile they took about $40.00from my bank account without my permission. I went to urban active last week to sign up for $14.95 special where I came to realize the assistant manager told me I need to pay $140 to change my plan.\n \nThe individual who has tricked me to sign the 2 years contract- and who lied to me by saying that the contract was monthly basis with the option of canceling it at anytime - is no longer working at Urban active. Due to the illegal activity of this employee, I am planning a lawsuit against this company in Davidson County in Tennessee.","stars":1.0}

I knew we'd be going past Frescos so I suggested we stop there instead of PJ Whelihan's. We hadn't been to Frescos in awhile and I figured a nice salad or soup would be a nice change. I wish we had bypassed it and gone to PJ's! The place was as I remembered it -but extremely loud this time. There was a party of more than 20 who must have thought they were in their own private dining room as their shouting and loud conversations took over the whole space. We sat down and were promptly greeted by our waiter and I ordered a grilled shrimp salad. My son ordered a burger and my wife ordered a chicken kabob salad. Our waiter then disappeared and we waited. And waited. And waited. He never once came back to update us on the status of our order. I could however see him in the back talking and laughing with his co-workers. Finally after almost 25 minutes I got up and walked over to him and asked about our order. He said it would be right out. Sure enough 30 seconds later it arrived. Gee - thanks for checking! My salad was sort of wilted and the shrimp were tiny. My sons burger looked ok and was cooked correctly. The other salad was fair. The bill was $40 which I felt was overpriced for what we got .

We were there for breakfast, which is served 8am-12pm. \n\nMy daughter was less than enthused with the selection, as she has very picky tastebuds, but opted for the biscuits and gravy with soft scramble eggs and crispy, crispy x 3 bacon. I inquired about the huevos rancheros, which sounded delicious but not quite what my tastebuds were after, so I requested the 3 eggs over easy with homefries and sausage patties. My man ordered the house made corned beef hash. We were served a plate full of buttered sourdough toast, which came two of our meals, and told we could request more if we desired. \n\nThe presentation was exactly what you would expect for a diner. There was a bit of grease and the portions were plenty. The only condiments on the table were salt and pepper, so be sure to ask for the ketchup and hot sauce if you desire them. My breakfast satiated me and the sausage patties were thick and juicy. My daughter was pleasantly surprised at how the cook satisfied her bacon desires...it really has to crisp, not bend, and most attempt it and burn it...not this cook, he completed the difficult task masterfully. She was a happy camper. May man seemed please with his hash. \n\nI also had a cup of joe ($2) while I was there and it was better than most diners I regularly visit. Now that I'm a coffee snob, it's really hard to find a decent poured cup that is bold and has good flavor. This was good enough that I would recommend it to others. Overall, the food was ok, and I would be willing to come back and check out their lunch menu, especially since I heard they make a really good burger. The price point seemed right on for the portions and equal to other diners in Reno ($7.50-$9.50). \n\nService was a-ok; she was friendly and charming and helpful with questions, but she also forgot the creamer for my coffee, and the hot sauce for our plates...it's those little things that make a difference for me. \n\nI was surprised that the place nearly emptied out before the AFC Championship started. I was expecting the opposite to happen. The bar has two decent size flat screens and a third tv that were all easy to view from our high top.  They turn up the volume for the main event. The tavern also has some gaming at the bar. \n\nI didn't pay attention to the alcohol situation, just enough to know they have a full bar. Just might look into their Happy Hour situation and maybe suggest them to another Yelper for her event. \n\nSo, if you want to check out one of Reno's longest established businesses that still rocks, head to Brickies.","stars":3.0}

The agaves burrito is filled generously with seafood and has a spicy cream sauce I would smother on many things. I liked both burritos and would suggest the former for someone who does not want as much heat and latter for sons who needs a nice hot sauce on the burrito. The burritos both came with great Mexican rice. The agaves burrito comes with a great sweet salad with mandarin oranges. The mojado has a more traditional salad that was very satisfying.

I also broke nearly two decades of meatless living on their medium rare filet and duck breast. Those dishes were that tempting to me at the time - and that delicious to sample off of other people's plates. Totally made me understand barely cooked meat where I'd been baffled before.

{"text":"If you are interested in taking a step back in time and enjoy a welcoming atmosphere coupled with excellent menu choices, then this restaurant is a wise choice.  \n\nThe lack of indoor dining in Philadelphia restaurants prevents you from getting the full City Tavern experience but the restaurant has adapted nicely by taking advantage of the expansive outdoor dining area in the back. There is plenty of room to socially distance but still restore some normalcy in your life for at least a few hours.\n\nThe menu offers a number of excellent entrees, whether you prefer beef, poultry, seafood or none of the above ( I.e. they have a nice selection of salads and offer Fried Tofu). My personal favorites are the roast duckling and the Tavern Lobster and Shrimp pie, but their pork loin and filet medallion entrees are also always excellent (which my wife will attest to certainly).\n\nAs a starter, the complimentary breads and rolls are excellent. There are a number of nice appetizers such as the Shrimp Cocktail and crab cake appetizers, which are always good. There is also a selection of salads, with the Country salad being a popular choice.\n\nIf you like soup with a nice amount of spice, the West Indies pepperpot soup is second to none. I could eat that soup ever day and still want another bowl.\n\nFor dessert, there are a number of excellent choices such as the chocolate mousse cake, the raspberry torte with ice cream (Bassets ice cream which has been been a Philadelphia staple since around 1861) and other excellent choices. \n\nYou also can purchase beers based\non the original recipes favored by our founding fathers, such as the Alexander Hamilton Treasury ale or Thomas Jefferson Tavern ale ( my favorite).\n\nTo top it off, the owner, Chef Staib is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. He has a true appreciation for his customers and, if you have ever seen his Taste of History series on PBS, has a true love for and understanding of how wonderful food and our rich history are so intertwined.","stars":5.0}

And nothing decor wise has changed in the rooms or hotel itself. The beds are probably ancient too, it was the classic experience where you end up sinking in the middle of the mattress.

{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Carmel while on a business trip. She is practically a regular at Mimi Blue and put it on my list of 'must do' places - and rightfully so!\n\nWe arrived at lunchtime, and they were pretty busy. The bartender offered us a table in the bar area and brought us menus and water. \n\nKnowing exactly what she wanted, my friend made sure our server, Andrew, know it was my first time. After taking our drink order, he brought us a sauce plate. It was a dinner plate with tiny dots of the nine sauces they offer on the menu and some tasting spoons. Each was marked with a letter in grease pencil to coordinate with the sauces letter on the menu.\n\nAt first glance, the menu can seem a bit confusing, but it's well worth the investment of time to read through and figure it out. I chose to go with the 4 Balls ($13.50) - my choice of any four Meatballs, paired with any sauce and a few slices of Baguette.\n\nI cheated; I also looked at the 'Mimi's Plate' section to see how the restaurant had paired up meatballs and sauces to get some ideas. \n\nMy friend's go-to is the Vegetarian Meatball with the Spicy Cilantro Sauce - so that made my list. I also went with the Classic Meatball with Marinara ('casue it is a Meatball place), the Fried Chicken with Sriracha Aioli and the special which was an Asian style meatball.\n\nThe Vegetarian Meatball with the Spicy Cilantro Sauce was AMAZING. Now I see why it's her 'go-to.' It was like eating a Samosa - it was moist and tender and packed with flavor. The Classic with Marina was perfect - but overshadowed by some of the other unique choices. The Fried Chicken isn't really a meatball as it was a nice, moist fried chunk of Chicken Breast, and the Spicy Sriracha was the perfect pairing for me. The Special Meatball was the weakest selection for me. It was a nice Meatball, but IMO the Soy Glaze was a bit salty for my taste.\n\nMy friend also RAVED about the Fried Brussels Sprouts ($8.00) - to the point where we each got an order. Again, ABSOLUTELY fabulous - even if you don't like Brussels Sprouts, you need to try these. They were tender, crispy, and delicious.\n\nI also went for the Mac and Queso ($8.00). It's not really Mac and Cheese. It was a big portion of Penne Pasta draped in a creamy, smooth white sauce... until you eat it and you get a slight hit of heat from it. It was really amazing... \n\nI like to be adventurous and play with my food. So, this was a home run for me. I got to mix and match Meatballs and Sauces. \n\nThe food was excellent, the service was friendly and attentive too, and I wish we had one in St Pete!","stars":5.0}

You can make it a combo, adding a side order of fries and a drink.  But, if you're gonna go that far, you might as well load the fries with nacho cheese.  You're in college (or just act like it).  You have the rest of your mundane life to work off the calories and cholesterol (kinda like that high interest student loan).","stars":3.0}

She was extremely nice and we paid for our food and waited for the rest of or food to get finished (baked lasagna takes a bit longer, but was worth the wait). The GM was visiting that day as well,  he was very nice and the crew sounded happy and having a great time. I think no matter what you do being able to enjoy your time at a job is huge!

It's endearing.\n\nFirst I really would like to point out that it's probably one of the cleaner airports I've ever been in and in fact parts of Terminal 1 seem more like a mall than an airport. Every time I've flown in the past couple years it's never been atrociously busy or crowded - or maybe I'm just used to real crowds at LAX, my home airport for 25 years.  The last time I flew I got a taxi on an icy night in zero seconds and was home within 30 minutes of getting off the plane, I swear it. I've only flown with southwest, which I assume has it's own yelp reviews, but everyone has been very friendly and nice. \n\nMy only peeve is really with the security. Full body scan, really? Also driving in to and out of the airport always seems to change and is down right confusing. But neither of these things are really that terrible. If you're traveling you best just be patient and deal with it or you'll just create more misery, because lets face it in this case it's really about the destination and not about the journey there (flight there).","stars":4.0}

{"text":"A group of 9 guys hit up M&M for the clay shooting introduction. They were the only trap\/skeet\/clay shooting location that was happy to have a group come, rent shot guns and sell ammo. An added bonus - it was sporting clays, which was incredibly fun.\nSporting Clays: Think golf with a shot gun. You go around from station to station. At each station a thrower (mechanical device that throws bright orange discs) or two will toss up a target for you to hit. Each station has different challenges - tree cover, targets that roll across the ground called \"rabbits\", some that go fast and straight, or far out and high. Most stations you get two targets and two shells - as soon as you shoot at the first one, the second one flies up. \nWe went with the \"Introduction to Sporting Clays\" package. For $85 per person, we had one loaner (Beretta Over\/Under) gun per group, safety goggles, ear plugs, 50 shells per person, 50 Targets, a golf cart to drive around and an instructor to tell us what to do. Don't forget to tip the instructor ($5 per person was what we went with). \nOur group was larger than you want to do at once, so we split into two groups. We started with 7 guys, and two showed up late. The late comers were able to meet up with us after the first station, so it ended up working out okay - but I give props to M&M for being so flexible with that. One of the late comers didn't want to shoot, but was still give (at no charge) eye and ear protection so he could come watch. \nThe fun thing about sporting clays is how different it is from station to station. There was no clear \"winner\" in our group - while someone might hit 5 out of 6 shots at one station, they would only hit 1 at the next. \nA few things I learned: Be aware of how you're holding the gun. A firm placement in the right place will save lots of bruising. Shooting clays is both relaxing and mentally taxing - but very fun. Over\/Under shotguns are easy to use and understand. The kick isn't as bad as I would have thought, but only if you're holding it right - listen to your instructor.\nPost shooting we were happy but all a bit exhausted. We spent a bit of time petting the hunting dog in the lodge while everyone settled their bill for the day. I wish we thought to bring some snacks so we could have just relaxed their a bit longer. However, lunch was calling, so we were on the road again pretty quickly.","stars":5.0}

They estimated the wait as best they could and to our surprise, 10 mins later, we were seated at the only 4 top. A noodle bar miracle!\n\nWhat we ordered:\nBroccoli with thai sausage- loved this. \nFried chicken and pork belly buns- to my surprise, I liked the chicken better though both were pretty tasty and had a yummy pickled cucumber slaw on top that totally added great crunch. \nDumplings in chili oil- definitely good but I love Han Dynasty's more.\nThe Black Garlic Wings- the winner. Totally lived up to the hype. The were huge, crispy and delicious.\nBBQ pig tails- these were also great. I loved the sauce. It was sweet! \nNoodle dishes-\nRamen \nBrisket\nBoth of the noodle dishes were very good though I would have liked a little more depth of flavor with the broth. I also thought that the meat in each were a tad overcooked to my liking BUT that being said, i enjoyed both. I think I found myself being a little more critical of the noodle dishes since, well, it's a noodle bar. \n\nTo sum up, I was totally thrilled with my Cheu's experience.

We had been there a few days prior during a music festival to get drinks and chips so we thought we'd go back and try the food.   Upon arriving at 8, I saw it was busy but we expected it to be since it was a Saturday evening during another festival.   We were told to find a table and sit.   We found one on the patio, sat and waited (and waited and waited and waited).   2 servers passed where we were sitting and didn't even give us a look.   Finally when we were about to get up and leave one came over ... He took our drink and food order and left.   \n\nOther people were coming and going -- getting their drinks, and chips and salsa.   There we sat and again waited and waited and waited.  40+ min later I went over to the water who took our order and asked why we had not received even our drinks or chips and salsa as he had bought other tables their drinks and chips and they had arrived way after us.   He said Oh I forgot you.  I asked to see a manager since we had not received anything. I even mentioned cancelling our order since we had not received it.\n\nThe owner came over and apologized.   She asked what she could do to make it right.  She said that our order had just come out but they brought it back to the kitchen since we canceled it.  I said I had only mentioned cancelling and really wanted to see the manager first.   She said she would go get our order so we decided to eat since it was ready.  Note we still did not have drinks, utensils, or any chips and salsa.    When it came out the items were soggy,   The lettuce on my taco was if it was sitting under a warmer for a long time.   It was awful but I was done with them and done complaining.   We finally got our drinks and utensils and ate a little.    Note even though they only charged us 50% for each item,  my daughter said that she was not impressed and does not plan to return and I agree. \n\nAt first we were trying to be patient since there was a festival going on, but when you see other tables getting their orders after arriving and we had Nothng, not even a water, you realize that we did not matter to them.   We were not young or a large table so we were ignored.   I hate to complain but I want others to know what we went through in case you are trying to determine if you should try them.   I have read other reviews since and it appears that lack of service and food taste is common.   It will be a long day before we return since even after we did finally get our food the quality was sub-par.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"NEVER! NEVER! NEVER! EVER! EVER AGAIN!!! How dare you Parx???\nSo let me paint you a picture. My man and I were celebrating our anniversary the entire 4 day weekend of 4th of July. We came back from the shore a day early and wanted to continue the good times, so we came up with Parx. Now, it's 2 oclock on a Saturday afternoon on a holiday weekend. No one is in town. Also, it was about 95 degrees. I had the top off the Wrangler and we were a lil sweaty to say the least. When we pulled up into the parking lot, it was pretty empty as you can imagine. At this point the Boo mentions he's wearing flip flops and asks me if I think it will be a problem. I say \"Hell no, look at the clientele\". As we were discussing, a size 16 woman was walking by wearing a size 2 outfit, one guy looked like he just changed his oil, and a group of elderly folks around the age of 100 were flocking from their bus trip. I say \"They should pay us to be here today\". We go on with our journey for fun with a pocket full of ducketts and a positive attitude. \n\nWe were starving. So the plan was identify a place to eat, get some cocktails and gamble. So, when we walked thru the glass doors, we immediately made a right to look at the info board to pick a restaurant. We decide, and start to walk. This is when I was treated so poorly, I just stood there with my mouth hanging open. \n\nSo the \"Greeter\" a bitter, middle aged woman, with a power trip and a clear case of hatin, stops me and says \"Excuse me, we don't let men walk around like that, so I can't let you\". I'm like WHAA??? I don't understand. Looking confused she goes on to say \"Men arent allowed to have their underwear out, either can you\". Still shocked I said \"my underwear isn't sticking out\". She says \"I know, but the back of your shirt is folded up, you need to fix that before going in\". She uses a tone so accusatory, I felt like I was some street walker coming to Parx to peddle my goods.\n\nHere, being sweaty, the bottom of my shirt flipped up, showing about a half inch of skin. No underwear, no ass crack, nothing. Just a tiny piece of skin at the bottom of my back.  And let me say, I was wearing a full length, to the floor, maxi skirt, white sleeveless shirt, and fancy flip flops. Nothing slutty about it. But I was made to feel slutty. On a holiday weekend. When business was scarce. Before I got to spend a dime. Thank Jebus for little favors.\n\nWithout speaking, the Boo and I just turned around and walked out. Went thru the door feeling like an ass. What did I do to deserve that?\n\nAfter this, we drive across the street to Carabbas. We were so hungry at this point. We walk in and the hostess says \"I love your skirt\"! We just bust out laughing. We explained what just happened, and they were horrified. \n\nSince the incident, I sent Parx customer service an email explaining what happened and I included a picture of what I was wearing, front and back view. That was July 6th. I have yet to be acknowledged. Boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, Parx. You stink!","stars":1.0}

However, often during the year you have to schedule out months in advance because they are full. Then you get behind on your services. And when you quit, you have to forgo all of those services you couldn't use because they can't fit you in during their imposed time limit. \n\nFor example, when I called yesterday the girl answering the phone said that the next available is in mid July (it is June 11th). \n\nObviously there are not enough therapists employed to allow for timely bookings. Or they just sign too many people up even though they can't keep up with the demand. \n\nYou have to schedule months ahead. I can't do that because I am not a lady of leisure or a student. I am a person with a job, kids, etc. I can't plan that far out because I cannot know what my job or kids responsibilities will be in 5-6 weeks. And for me a massage does not take priority over those things. So I had to tell them to stop charging my credit card every month. \n\nPrior, during the year, the massage Envie staff called me twice to cancel my scheduled appointments that I had waited months for. \n\nSo when I cancelled my membership, (told them to stop automatically charging my credit card) they said I had to use up all of my services in a short time (around a month). So because they had cancelled my sessions and because you have to schedule so far in advance I ended up with around 6 services left to use up in a month or so. Well, that is impossible to do because you can't even get an appointment (as a program member) for 5 or 6 weeks!\n\nYesterday, when I tried to explain this to the massage Envie booking girl, she would not listen to me at all. I was being respectful and nicely trying to tell her what happened and why I had to stop the program but she had no interest in solving the problem and no apology that they could not ensure that I could consistently book within around two weeks. And no apology that they had basically stolen my money by not delivering services that they charged me for on my credit card.\n\nInstead, the receptionist acted as if I was being rude for taking up her time, put me on hold several times, interrupted me repeatedly, and never let me explain what had happened (that massage Envie had cancelled on me twice, etc.) \n\nThey will tell you that you can book timely but don't believe it, it's not true. If you are a busy working person without endless flexibility you may not be able to get all of those appointments in and be months behind. Then when you stop letting them automatically charge your credit card you have only a month to get all of those services in. And then they can't take you because they are full. \n\nIt makes no sense but they took my money for a year. And the girl doing the booking was so rude even after I had obviously been totally screwed. \nI think this is a case of \"you get what you pay for.\" It's a chain massage place, I probably should have known it would be like a \"fast food\" version of massage.","stars":1.0}

We sat at the bar and watched the super talented chef prepare all sorts of great food.  Wife and I had the Tres Colores salad - very fresh and lemony, with great anchovy flavor.  Light and crisp. Then we had the grilled broccolini - perfectly charred and seasoned; and house-made raviolo - a giant filled pasta with wonderful creamy sauce and mushrooms.  For the main course, we shared the braised rabbit with sweet potato gnocchi.  Since the chef noticed we had shared our dishes, he prepared the rabbit on two plates instead of the customary one for us, splitting the meal perfectly.  The rabbit was so tender and melted in your mouth, the sweet potato gnocchi perfectly light, and the sauce warm and comforting on a cold night.  \n\nWould 100% recommend this place to anyone and will certainly return when back in New Orleans.

I purposely ordered food that should not take long (soup, sandwich and side) and my kids' food also was fairly easy to prepare (spaghetti). After 25 minutes past the order time, our server apologized and said she had talked to the manager, and when she brought our food, said it was on the house. She was friendly, attentive and apologetic and she went well out of her way to make us happy, proactively, without us saying a word. It speaks well of the restaurant that they wanted to do this for us without us complaining. The food, by the way, was actually pretty good.

Whether this discrepancy is based on front of the house\/back of the house differences is beyond me, but the atmosphere of the front of the restaurant was loud enough to make me think that they need to offer dining ONLY in the other area of the restaurant. \n\nI'm not saying I wouldn't go back to Cabana, but it's definitely not at the top of my list for a revisit.","stars":3.0}

My tablemate ordered the same dish and received different colored fish: one lightly brown\/yellow and 2 dark brown pieces. It was probably due to frying the portions in different oils...old vs. new.

{"text":"Another birthday, another holiday, and another fine dining establishment checked off of my list. This place for the most part provided a good experience. The wait staff and the hostess were extremely professional. They made sure all of our water glasses were filled and would timely come by to refill them when they were near empty. The waitress patiently answered our questions about the menu and offered some good suggestions. Food for the most part was great as well. The presentation was spot on, especially the dessert. The entr\u00e9es were made with skill and was of a portion size that left you feeling satisfied but not stuffed. I ordered the scallop and grits this time around. The jumbo scallops were seared perfectly on the outside and had a nice tender bite to it. The grit cakes had a nice bit of charring that helped to keep their texture together and complemented the roasted carrots and parsnips. Personally, I would have been fine with 4 pieces of grit cake instead of 6. The 6 pieces pushed the entr\u00e9e towards a heavier feel. 4 would have lightened up the feel of the dish a bit. \n\nHowever, the one slight disappointment was how my mom's ribs came out. I absolutely understand that caramelized ribs with slight charring means flavor. But when the dish initially came out, some of the pieces were definitely closer to being burnt than just slightly charred. The burnt parts definitely left a bitter aftertaste that took away from the overall feel of the entr\u00e9e. However, I do have to commend the waitress for asking us if we wanted a different rib of which came out perfectly cooked. \n\nOverall, but for that slight disappointment on the ribs, I had a good time at this restaurant and would definitely want to come by again. I trust that my experience with the ribs was not representative of the quality or standards of this place. I just hope that they continue to uphold high standards for every dish that leaves the kitchen.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I have been using this lab for many years because it is near my house.  The service has never been good with long waits and no clear idea how long it would take.  So for my most recent visit, I made an appointment for 7:15 am.  It is the first time slot of the day.  \n\nWhen I arrived, I went to the outside door, and it was locked.  There was no sign that I could see telling me why.  I was about to leave when I noticed that people were coming and going from the outside door at the other end of the hallway.  So I went around the building and got in that way.\n\nI arrived in the office at 7:10.  The sign-in is now electronic and rather cumbersome in that if you make a mistake, you have to start over.  Having signed in, I saw my name as first on the list of people waiting.\n\nI sat there watching a slick TV production about how Sonora Quest was all about customer service and satisfaction.\n\nAt 7:25, they called in the person whose name was after mine.  When I went to the desk to ask why, a sullen young woman informed me that mine  was a \"long\" order and she had not finished entering it.  I asked for my health insurance cards to be returned to me.  She handed me the cards AND the paper for the tests.\n\nI returned to my seat and saw my name disappear from the waiting list.  Back at the desk, I was told that my order had been canceled because I had asked for my cards back.  To me asking \"may I have my cards back\" does not equal \"cancel my order.\"  Apparently it did to the sullen young woman.\n\nIt was now 7:28, and I was told that there was a sign somewhere in the office that said that there could be a 15-minute delay in appointment times.  I had not seen this sign; perhaps because my attention had been captured by the slick TV presentation touting how much the laboratory cared about its patients.\n\nI said that this was very bad service.  There were two male attendants this morning--a tall one with hair and a short one who is bald.  The short bald one, then asked each of the other people waiting if they had had bad service.  Since most of them had just arrived and sat down, they'd had no service whatsoever.\n\nOther than to either embarrass me or preen in front of the sullen young woman, I cannot guess what the bald man's motives were, but his actions were certainly unnecessary and did nothing to make anyone in there feel more at ease.\n\nIf you have a choice, pick a lab whose staff is pleasant and better able to accommodate \"long\" orders in the time allotted.","stars":1.0}

I'm a terrible shot, but I can't wait to go back and sharpen my skills.\n\nThe front-end staff were a little bit slack, ignoring me and my friend when we first walked in, but I was on vacation so I didn't mind. Once we got our waivers signed, picked our guns (I went with a 9mm, since I've never fired a handgun before) and targets (zombies!) we headed to the range.\n\nEven with ear defenders on, handguns are loud! Especially in the enclosed space of a firing range. I'll admit to being a bit startled by the noise until I was on the line firing my own weapon.\n\nIn the actual firing range area, the range master went over the safety rules and how to properly use the guns. I found that it was kind of a pain in the ass to load the clip at first, but I quickly got the hang of it and was soon loading my clips almost as fast as I was unloading them.\n\nThe adrenaline rush of firing a handgun is pretty awesome.

{"text":"This was the most outstanding and memorable restaurant meal of my entire half-century of existence.\n\nNot because of particularly excellent food, drinks or service--though all were good to very good--but because it was the first restaurant meal after staying in for three months.  Quite the feeling to sit on a sidewalk bench and have food magically appear in front of us again.  \n\nOur Mexican plates were good, absolutely traditional Tex-Mex with lots of cheese and sauce.  Good salsa and chips, and extra points for the warm chips.   The large margaritas came in those comically large goblets that are now so popular (or were). This wasn't top-shelf level but it was supremely satisfying none the less.\n\nIf you are looking for satisfying standard Mex that you would expect in any major city, this is your place.  \n\nCOVID19 NOTES:  We were seated on sidewalk picnic tables that afforded six foot distances from other patrons.  Folks passing by on the sidewalk came closer than six feet momentarily, but nearly everyone on Magazine Street that day was abiding by mask guidelines.  The wait staff was uniformly masked and gloved.  After we had been eating awhile, I noticed a cigarette butt left on the edge of our table by the wall.  Our server deftly picked it up, then peeled off his blue glove in one graceful move and captured the offending butt in the glove. I suspect he did that on the spot so we'd see it and be assured he wasn't keeping that glove on after handling a nasty butt.  I was so impressed with that deft maneuver I wondered weather he had a second job as a surgeon.  (Who, it's worth mentioning, wear masks to protect the patient, not themselves).","stars":4.0}

Because of the room we got seated right away. \n\nLet's get the less than great parts out of the way. After we sat, I asked for a bottle list. ( Isaac Newton's is supposed to have an extensive beer list) Waitress told me that she could give me a bottle list, but that it was so out of date that most of it would be wrong. SHe asked me if there was anything I specifically wanted, I said no- then I asked for a draft list- which I was told was written on a board behind me. The draft list did have a varied selection, however I would have preferred a list on the table. Also, it's kind of hard to enjoy an extensive bottle list, if you don't get to ever see it and explore it. Other thing is that the menus were a bit old and falling apart and the decor is just kind of whatever. The place has literally no vibe. \n\nFood was inconsistent. I ordered the mussels. I did not enjoy them. I found them to be chewy, grainy, and bland. My friend found her food to be a bit too buttery. \n\nNow the good stuff!\n\nThe beers we did have off the draft list were delish. We ordered the Brie wheel appetizer. It was delicious and amazing. It was Brie with pita and lingonberry sauce. Just thinking about it makes me hungry! We were literally scraping the plate. My boyfriend had the fish and chips. He said it was his second favorite fish and chips. Great batter, great sauce. Fries could have been a littler thicker and firmer. My friend had the crab grilled cheese. Even though she said it was buttery it was packed with crab and it was tasty! The Belgium fries that came with my mussels were scrumptious. \n\nOverall, good food- just inconsistent.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I stopped by Five on an impulse.  The last time we visited this space, it was Fabio's (where we often had supper years ago) and the transformation is quite marked.  We chose to have the prix fixe dinner with its excellent wine pairings and were delighted that eating every shred of the food and drinking every drop of the wine left us very satisfied, but neither over-stuffed nor tipsy.  The still young chef cooks with inspiration and care using the freshest local ingredients and treating them respectfully and imaginatively.  The attention to detail was impressive: the house-made bread was superb with the food and a tasty olive oil for dipping, the plating was exquisite, and the service was perfect. The mussels were cooked with well-balanced, satisfying flavors, the salmon tartare was lovely in a European way, the salads we chose were rare treats with locally grown sorrel and white asparagus respectively, and the broiled salmon entree was very fine with the fish cooked to succulence just beyond raw.  The only disappointment was  a pork tenderloin that seemed bland and dry, served with a polenta that was also bland. Sometimes locally sourced meat is surprisingly trickly to cook.  We applaud serving local cheeses, but feel Five Bistro could be more selective and offer just the best variety from each farm rather than several different kinds.  Some of these cheeses still need to develop further to be really dilicious.  We recommend going with the chef's wine pairings: there were no false notes here.  And service by Jennifer was exactly right: formal  without being snooty, friendly without being intrusive, and very knowledgeable.  All in all it was probably the most delightful meal I have eaten in St Louis, all made and served by people half our age.  This augurs well for the future.","stars":5.0}

When a house we wanted through Tricon was gone, the lady assisted us in being the first to apply for a different one. Our only qualifications were had a fenced in yard, and in Tampa Bay. \n\nWe move into the house just to find out that the yard is not fully fenced in, only 2\/3rd's of it. This was our only reason for moving was for a yard for the dogs.

{"text":"I went to American family care in Smyrna Tennessee to get medical clearance for my cosmetic surgery I thought all went well until couple days later I went back to see if they sent my labs over they acted as if they didn't know what I was talking about or where my labs were sent. They told me that I needed to come back the next day when the doctor that I had seen was there I had no time to wait because there is it a certain time that your medical clearance Has to be faxed over to your cosmetic doctor.  I asked to speak with the manager they told me that all their managers were out with Covid and that I had to contact a manager at another clinic so they gave me a number to another clinic which was Nashville south in Antioch Tennessee. The ladies at the front Desk were great and so were the doctors but they still forgot to do a PTT lab on me so I got poked like three times and my blood drawn yet to find out they still missed a test. it's very upsetting and it's a waste of time. I contacted American family care to find out if I could go straight to LabCorp and get my blood drawn and they told me no I have to come back to them pay the 175 again and then be billed later on by LabCorp. something just didn't sit right with me so I contacted LabCorp in Murphreesboro on my own and they said sure you can come on down and will do your labs here an fax then over..  I don't know if American family care south was trying to get more money out of me Or if they just didn't know what they were talking about. \nall I know is I will never go back to American family care again and I wouldn't advise anyone else to go there either","stars":1.0}

They were aware ahead of time that it was his birthday and everyone who came in contact with him wished him a happy birthday.\n\nThe waiter walked us through everything including the history, the food, the recommendations. We started with the charbroiled oysters which were awesome. Our cocktails were also great. I had the 8oz filet and my boyfriend had the ribeye. My bf did enjoy his ribeye but he felt mine was the superior steak...which it was. \n\nWe finished the meal with the maple duck bacon friend ice cream which was creamy, delicious and fun! I think the nicest touch was that the owner himself brought my boyfriend a \"gift\". A Box of truffles in a box that had a bow on it.

{"text":"This was our second visit to Omiza in Doylestown. We planned this as our joint anniversaries dinner for five.  Last time we ate in the main dining room and had sushi and other fare.  This time we decided on Korean BBQ.  We had reservations on a Saturday and were seated promptly. Our server, Albert came over and gave us an overview and took our cocktail orders. The cocktail menu is well curated with interesting combinations that follow a \"Family\" theme.  I chose The Elder Son, others tried Wife 2.0 and Man's Best Friend.  The pink color of Mans Best Friend was striking.  We ordered a few sashimi and sushi appetizers and put in our order for the Korean BBQ. Two Omiza's Butchers' Feasts plus Crispy Pork Belly and The Snake River Wagyu. Each of the feasts serves two.  Food arrived and each platter was clearly explained. Ribeye, Filet and Short Rib on one.  Chicken, Ribeye and short rib on the other.  The Crispy Pork Belly arrived in a cast iron skillet. We started cooking after the Beef Tallow fire show, where they grease the grill with a chuck of Rib Cap.  (Oooo, Ahhhhh). About halfway through, Albert checks in. I ask about the Wagyu.  He pauses and indicates it was on the tray with the other meats.  I beg to differ. He goes to kitchen and returns, assuring me we already ate it.  I ask for a manager.  Manager defends server and kitchen but only after I start to create a fuss, relents and delivers an order of Wagyu.  We cooked and ate the Wagyu last and savored it.  We realized later, after leaving that the Wagyu thing was INTENTIONAL and not a mistake.  We have a picture of the platter before we started eating. No Wagyu in sight. I appreciate that they offered to provide the order for this $50 portion. That's right, 14, half inch cubes for $50 and they tried to convince us we already ate it.  The place is nice, the prices a little high for the area but its a great experience.  I gave the three stars because everything else was very good.  Wondering if anyone else got phantom Wagyu?  Hope to get a response from management.  BTW, this entire situation could have been reversed by not being defensive, not declaring that we were wrong and making up for it in some way.  The total bill, including tax and tip was $430.  I will probably not go again. Trust is important.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Normally I would be excited about Sorrento's. Unfortunately this wasn't one of those times. When we walked in, it took almost five minutes to actually be acknowledged. The restaurant was only half full, so there shouldn't have been an issue with a courteous \"hello, we will be with you in just a minute.\"  The salad was as bare as a baby's butt... a little red onion, croutons, and seasoning couldn't have hurt. Then came the appetizers. The bruschetta wasn't bad, but without any onion or real seasoning, there was nothing to rave about. The Caprese... that was a disaster. Sliced tomato drowning in olive oil, a piece of garlic here and there, and the scarce mozzarella was obviously low end. Had the chef bothered to google a pic of how it should have looked, he would certainly have been mortified. Now on to the main course. We ordered eggplant parm, and chicken parm. The chicken parm was run of the mill, a bit like it was from the frozen section of the supermarket... especially with the fact that the chicken was very dry (something that a parm should never be). The eggplant parm on the other hand was decent. The eggplant was sliced thin, the sauce was not overbearing, and there was enough melted mozzarella that I wasn't totally disappointed. However it could not live up to previous visits. Overall, I think tonight's chef has given up on life. Hopefully this is an isolated incident?","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Another pretty good Sunday brunch find. This was not my first choice, but the idea of a $16 all you can eat Sunday brunch buffett reminded me of my early days at places like shoney's and a little place called Grandy's in a little town called Gainesville in a little state called Florida. So Copper Kettle it was!\n\nThe place was jamming when we went in, and they just had to close thee patio because of the 3 day deluge of rain that was about to set in(why anyone settled in this place a few hundred years ago is still beyond me, tornados, floods, paralyzing inches of snow, abusive heat and the worst allergy season ever. Someone should have told those assholes to pack up their covered wagons and keep moving). So, there was a bit of a wait, but nothing too tricky. Then we got seated and the server told us to go get it. The spread had a bit of everything, little pastries, smoked salmon, a variety of pasta\/chicken\/cold salads. They had a carving station, goat cheese fritters(awesome), poached eggs, rolls, the list continues.... O and I can't possibly forget about the hash brown casserole, cracker barrel should just stop serving their version, this shit was delicious.\n\nThey also had waffles and omelets to order, I had some sort of crab omelet and the lady ha some waffles for dessert. Now, on to brunch dessert buffett(dessert for brunch, how delightfully unnecessary). They had a bunch of little cakes and pastries, but they had a bowl of something called \"dirt pie\" apparently a southern delicacy of pudding, whipped cream, Oreos, and some other diabetes causing shit. This was next to a bowl of some sort of raspberry cake, whipped cream thing. One scoop of each on top of each other combined for the perfect brunch dessert I like to call \"Ricky bobby's wet dream\". Only hiccup, they briefly ran out of plates, but hey shit happens. This place is definitely in the Sunday rotation now, which is up to 2. C'mon nashville, get your brunch together son.","stars":4.0}

The rice is always fluffy, beans are not too soft or hard, chicken isn't overcooked, and the queso and quacamole are always prime.\n\nI typically get the craft 2 and choose the 3-cheese nachos and small burrito. I say small, but that's only in comparison to the full size one, which consistently reminds me of the size a small infant might be, wrapped in tortilla swaddling. Qdoba is nice because all the ingredients taste and feel fresh, so even though they serve you a lot, it doesn't feel like a ton of calories (I said \"feel\" - I did not look up how many calories are in my usual meal.) \n\nIf anything, I recommend ordering a side of chips with queso - they're slightly salty with a lime taste.

My wife had a really delicious spicy jambalaya with enormous prawns. That dish had a huge portion and was packed with flavor and heat.

{"text":"First off, I want to say this. I was so upset by my experience at Kin that I knew I planned on writing about it when I got home, however I was surprised to find that the business has yet to have any comments about other customer experiences, so I created a listing for the business to have a future opportunity to prove me wrong.\n\nCovid made many businesses adjust to how they did business, and since they opened up in the middle of Boise being shut down, at home meal kits were a staple of kin, and instagram was a great way to find out about their rotating monthly menu options. A few of my acquaintances had tried and enjoyed the home kits, so when my friends said we were going to Kin for dinner, we were all pretty excited because of the hype that had been built up.\n\nHype quickly became disappointment when we pulled up the menus to find that their physical location only offered appetizers under the \"bar food\" section. All the wonderful meals we had heard about were not available to the presently hungry patrons who arrived at a dinner hour. This could have been an oversight on our part if we had looked on their website, but the hype was real and we had believed it. We ordered our cocktails and I looked closer at the menu and found something I had never seen in another restaurant.\n\n\"An optional 2.8% service charge to support employee health insurance and PPE will be added to every check.\"\n\nMy friend asked, \"Why do they say it's optional?\" I responded with, \"It's optional because you aren't required to pay it, but do you want to be the person that tells their server that you don't want them to have insurance, even when their employer should be providing it for them. By saying it's optional, it guilts you into doing the right thing so the owners aren't obligated to. It's the same thing as paying an Idaho minimum wage of $3.35 to servers and expecting your customers to pick up the other 80% of fair wages.\"\n\nI asked the server if they offered full meals, and instead of owning the restaurants decision to being more dedicated to cocktails and apps, he tried to give a longwinded explanation on how the owners have good relationships with the farmers so they want to support them with their menu, but he never actually said anything about not offering entrees, rather, he skated around the concept. It's perfectly fine to do cocktails and apps, just tell me and don't give me excuses to try and order a dozen apps so I can be full on overpriced small portions. \n\nBy this point, our cocktails came, and to my surprise, my wife and I had the same drink, however hers showed up in a tom collins, and mine in a pint glass. This may seem like a minor thing, but consistency in a restaurant is huge for repeat business. If the glass sizes are different, the cocktail ingredient ratios aren't consistent, and you can't expect a repeat experience. This detail got me curious, so I looked at all of our plates, and realized they were all cheap mismatched dinnerware that looked like you can get at DI for .79. My friends said, \"Maybe they want a mismatched vibe?\" I responded, \"Maybe they wanted to save every penny they could and wanted customers to front as much of the cost for a half hearted experience, but maybe it's just dishes that don't vibe.\"\n\nThe check came (with the 2.8% already added) and I paid for the overpriced drinks and we left. Here is my takeaway. Three hours later, I ate somewhere else, but I'm still annoyed at how much  of a lazy approach this was to dining. The dinnerware is an indication of the types of decisions the owners make to cut costs, the addition of the 2.8% is another indication that the owner is unwilling to provide his employees benefits from his earnings, the attitude I received from the server made me feel like I wasn't good enough for the restaurant, and the cost of drinks was ridiculous. The only reason I'm not giving a flat out 1 star is because my drink was decent, which you should expect out of a cocktail bar, but I have no idea if it will be good if I go back, and that's why I won't.\n\nIf this is post-covid downtown Boise, I'm out.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Date night at The Chef's Table was so incredible! There are only a few seats there, so definitely make reservations. (You can't make them online, so just give them a call to request!) \n\nTapas are by far my favorite way to dine, and perfect for a romantic meal. Add a front row seat to all of the culinary action, a candlelit space, and you have yourself a pretty special dining experience, one surely to impress!! \n\nWe started with some creative cocktails, but of course. 'Talk To Her', made with butter washed run, and black tea with orange and peychaud bitters was a standout for me. 'Broken Hugs' is delicious too. It's lighter and refreshing. Hubs is a fan of the spicy 'Matador'. The aged manchego with granny apple slices and lavender honey, the mixed olives and the thinly sliced Serrano and jamon were perfect lighter first bites we ordered while sipping. That honey is so delicious and sweet. It balanced the tart apple and savory cheese so well. \n\nWe were given complimentary tuna spread with tasty flat crackers that also started out meal off on the right foot!\n\n*You can't go wrong with one of their three sangrias or imported cava or brut though. \n\nMust haves are obviously patatas bravas and the gambas al Ajillas (garlic shrimp). Don't be surprised if you find yourself order a second helping of either! Fan favorites for sure! \n\nPlant based dishes that should NOT be overlooked are the Berenjenas con miel, perfectly fried eggplant fries with rosemary aioli and spiced garlic honey! Holy moly, these are so good!! The Setas, seasonal mixed mushrooms with truffle oil are seemingly simply, but are to die for!! They are absolutely drool-worthy!! \nThe Coco de Alfachofas flatbread with artichokes, black truffle and manchego is pretty great too! The truffle was very present! \n\nThe crispy open half shelled lagosta (Maine lobster) and tender vierias (diver scallops) are both excellent mains. Super fresh, well cooked and very tasty! I love and appreciate that can order these half, which gives you the option to taste this, and still have room for other dishes as well. \n\nFor dessert we had a trio sample of their desserts...tres leche, decadent chocolate cream filled cream cakes and a traditional hazelnut cookie. Everything was super delicious but the chocolate, oh, yesssss!! Dreamy! It just oozed our! \n\nOur service at the counter was stellar!!

Not much flavor overall but a whole lot of salt. Home fries are often overcooked and extremely brown. Eggs are okay. I give them credit for usually knowing how to make an over easy egg correctly. I am thankful that my friend has gotten tired of the scrapple so I don't have to come here and choose from the relatively disappointing menu. This place is really just your run of the mill diner without being called that.","stars":2.0}

The first visit, we opted to sit at the sushi bar, and we were served by the most awesome young man. Tony knows his stuff, having learned the art of sushi making in Japan. The sushi was excellent -and having worked in Japan for many years, we know our sushi!  Today, on our second visit, we opted for the Thai side of the menu. We asked for Tony and he came out to greet us. He asked us what kind of Thai food we liked and recommended a dish for me - the Tofu and Eggplant with Green Curry. Loved it!  For my husband, he offered to make a special, off-menu dish. It, too, was spot on and excellent!  The Thai Iced Tea is very, very good, too. The service has been attentive both times, and all the staff is very friendly. Although it was busy this afternoon, service was quick. As we left, every single staff person offered a goodbye. The restaurant has very nice decor and everything is always impeccable. Thinking back on today's experience, I realized that we never even opened the menu and got an amazing meal.

Would have been 45 minutes for a table if we waited so we opted for the bar seating area which was fine.\n\nWe chose a high table top adjacent to the bar and next to a window (perfect for people watching lol).\n\nWhat I loved about this place is that they offer flights of beers for roughly 12 bucks.  I think all breweries shouls have this option so you can sample the fare!  They offered a seasonal flight as well as the house flight.  Each consisted of eight small sample size beers  Though I love flights I was underwhelmed unfortnuately by the beers offered at this brewery.  Many of them lacked the flavor and consistency I was hoping to enjoy.\n\nOn the plus side the food and service were great!\nWe staretd with the pretzel appetizer which was good.\n\nFor my entree I had the mahi mahi pan seared salad!  It was a full size mahi mahi steak cut in half prepared medium rare and was DELICIOUS.  I ate the mahi first and had the salad as a separate dish lol.  There was also a mahi mahi dish (without the salad) that cost considerabley more.  I can't say for sure what the difference is but this salad seemed the better option!\n\nThe waitress was very helpful and friendly despite being busy and discussed each of the beer samples she served us.\n\nOverall: good place to eat but in my opinion if I wanted craft beer I would likely go somewhere else.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. So let's start with where you from? Im originally from the NO but haven't lived there since the late 80's so every chance I get to go home I do but thats only about once per year. I usually eat a lot of \"real New Orleans\" food out my families kitchen or the corner type  Cajun Seafood Stores, but this trip was different. This was the food tour trip and Silk Road was a lunchstop for me and my bestie on day 3.\n\nSo let's start with the place. It was virtually empty inside but has nice dining area that felt pubish in decor. Heavy dark wood.  my bestie wanted to sit outside where they had a few small patio table on a walkway in front. I was really resistant at first but she swayed me and honestly it was one of the best parts of the experience. They have some plants and Ivy that provided some division from the street which was not very busy and the temperature was great prob mid to upper 70's.\n\nwe started with Mango Mimosas. Not a fan of Mimosas in general so that was just average for me. (The waitress was a good saleswoman) Next, we had the Korean Chicken Wings, Crab Cake, and the Simosas. The crab cake is DELISH! 5 stars but it's spicy, if you don't like spicy food dont order the CC. The Simosas, Bestie enjoyed and I tasted one and it was good but it is Vegetarian so personally not as good in my book carnivore here. The chicken wings were well cooked and seasoned but the korean title is slightly deceptive because it was more of a sweet soy glaze and didn't have any of the usual red peppered paste Korean sweet and spicy elements.  bestie and I both ordered the butter chicken and man  it was good too and a reflection of the Creole\/Indian Infusion. But the star, the star of the show was the Mango Cheesecake!. I should have gotten one to go! It was indescribably delish! Service was great and we had plenty food to take with us. would def return on my next trip if only for the cheesecake and a drink on the sidewalk.","stars":5.0}

We went as soon as it opened up and everyone pretty much walked in the rides.. the later you go, the more people. \n\nThe rides and stores open up throughout the day.

On the other hand I do stop for my early morning coffee. When they open at 6:00 a.m., there is a large variety of items to choose from, very little is unavailable. The regulars come and go within 15 to 20 minutes addressing one another. It's a pleasant morning experience.\n\nPanera has a generous and user friendly customer reward program. After a few purchases you earn free food and for your birthday a sweet treat.

{"text":"I am so sorry to do this but the place actually deserve 3 plus stars but the dishonest server led me to give one star, details are as followed! \n\nWe went for an early dinner around 6PM. The place is mediocre, nothing fancy but the hotel where we were staying had given a good feedback about this place. So we went in, the place was pretty empty at this time, there were may be two other tables with customers. We ordered the mix grill as an appetizer. Usually, grilled appetizers such as theses come out piping hot and you usually have to wait a few minutes before you can even touch it. But our mixed grill came out just a bit warm, like it was cooked earlier (most likely, I am pretty sure, left over from lunch buffet (take a look at the picture)) So with my over communicating personality, I politely asked the server lady if the mixed grill was left over from lunch buffet? Obviously, she wasn't going to tell me the truth... But instead of lying straight out, she could have just blamed it on the kitchen & bring me freshly grilled mixed grill..\n\nUpdate: changing to 3 stars, went back for lunch buffet before leaving town.

{"text":"After reading about Dennis Foy's history, my wife and I decided to give D'Floret a go.    The food was so perfect we wound up making a reservation for my parents and purchasing them a gift cert.  The dining room is small but romantic and the outside courtyard is quaint and comfortable.  The prices were very reasonable especially for a BYO.  \n\nThe menu had so many enticing items I was hoping the food would be good so we could return to try more.  Well it was!!!  We started with the crab tian and potato gnocchi.  The amazingly fresh crab was simply tossed a fresh aioli and crisped under the broiler.  It was heavenly!  The cloud like gnocchi were the first I have eaten since my grandmothers where you can actually taste the earthiness of the potato.  That paired with the wild mushroom sauce and reggiano made for a perfectly balanced dish.  The two together had us moaning.  For entrees we had the pan roasted Snapper with tomato concasse and the dry aged sirloin with mashed potatoes with english peas.  The snapper's skin was perfectly rendered crispy while keeping the flesh moist and sweet.  The skin was like a potato chip and so, so good.  It was over a bed of farm fresh tomatoes and chive oil.  Again, simple and flawlessly executed.  My wife's steak was perfectly seasoned, seared and cooked to medium rare.  It was such a good quality cut she actually ate the fat.  The potatoes were light and creamy and the peas were fresh not frozen.  We didn't have dessert because we were stuffed to the gills and enjoying our wine.  The only con I see here is the wait staff is a bit young and inexperienced which is why I give 4 stars.  I could see the people in this area being a little turned off with that type of service but the food makes up for it.\n\nIn a showcase interview I read with Dennis Foy about D'Floret he said \"I'm cooking more simply, but bringing out more flavor in my ingredients\".  Dennis is sticking to his word and pulling it off with perfect technique and execution.  Why this place doesn't have a waiting list is beyond me.  Pack some great wine and get to D'Floret!!!","stars":4.0}

The best thing about coming here was the recommendation for a different restaurant for dessert (what Mexican\/taco place doesn't have desserts churros....tres leches.....come on!). My suggestion is completely skip Bakersfield and try the dessert recommendation Caf\u00e8 Intermezzo one block south toward the river. We didn't even take pictures not worth the storage on my phone to be honest.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this little bistro we tried it last night. The menu is pretty limited so we asked the server (he appeared to be the father of the chef) if they had salads or bread. He said no yet two tables that came in after us had ordered a large salad that they split. One table had garlic bread. That was very odd since we inquired about both. The bill came and the amount was wrong  and on top of that we were charged tax twice. We had to explain to both the server and the chef, who I think is the owner, some basic math. The issue was resolved. \n\nRegarding the food my wife enjoyed her dish but I was not happy with mine. I had the pasta carbonara and added the chicken option. The chicken was somewhat dry and lacked any seasoning. \n\nIt is doubtful that we will be returning.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"oh maggiano's, what HAPPENED to you?!\n\ni haven't been to a maggiano's since i moved out here. so it's been almost 3 years since my last rendezvous with what i remembered as a glorious italian chain restaurant.\n\nback in the day, when i would frequent the maggiano's in LA or OC, i remember a $11 pasta dish and half a $9 appetizer could last me three meals. the plates were large, oval-shaped and overflowing with copious amounts of pasta. it wasn't amazing pasta, but for the price and portion size, it was really an unbeatable deal. and they have penne pasta! magnificent.\n\ni came here with a few friends after a long day at valley forge. i was expecting the same kind of food i remembered from 3 years prior. what i got completely knocked me off my feet in the worst way possible.\n\n1. there was a wait time. like half an hour! at 4pm in the afternoon?! what the heck?! do families and youngsters really have nothing better to do at that time of the day?\n2. upon being seated, there were clearly a bunch of empty tables. why then was there such a long wait time? we didn't HAVE to sit in the booth that we didn't even request\n3. not that i eat any of it, but the bread that's supposed to start out the meal took the longest time to get to the table. like it appeared only a couple minutes before our entrees did\n4. my usual penne pasta dish had increased $4 in price\n5. when the dish came, it was at least half the size of plates i remembered, if not smaller\n\ni guess maggiano's really took a hit when the economy plummeted. i really hope these downfalls are just specific to this particular location. i'd be sad if maggiano's nationwide got demoted to a typical crappy italian chain restaurant.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Have passed by here many times so my wife and grandson and I decided to give it a try. The place was pretty busy so we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. No problem because we had our desert first at their ice cream shop across the street. The decor is industrial, comfortable and pleasant with a well stocked  bar as well as their own ice cream display which is bigger than the one across the street. The grandson and I both ordered fish and chips which were as good as I'd ever had even on the coast. My wife had a steak salad which was huge and tasty as well. I usually don't expect much from pub grub but this was exceptional food for this type of establishment. The staff was friendly and accommodating as well. To top it off the manager was out on the floor making sure everything was going smoothly and leading the way for his staff. I appreciate and admire that kind of service which is so rare.

{"text":"I frequent World Cafe Live, both upstairs and downstairs, often. They usually have great music. The sound is better downstairs, but that's to be expected, since that's where the bigger acts play. The ambience is nice. The servers are pretty attentive for a music venue; I have yet to have a truly bad experience with the waitstaff.\n\nTheir beer selection is all right. They have a rotating Victory tap and usually a Dogfish Head tap, so I'm pretty happy. They even had Hop Wallop on tap, which is a fine, fine beer. The beer prices are pretty standard for Philly. However, the fancy drinks are pretty ridiculously priced. I once got a Strawberry Shortcake drink, and although it was delicious, it wasn't quite worth $10. Also, the well drinks are $7 or thereabouts, which is pretty outlandish. I think they use middle-shelf liquor, at least, and not Vladimir or Banker's Club. The food is okay, but a little expensive for what they offer. The veggie chili was okay, if maybe a little thick. But $8 for a grilled cheese seems like highway robbery to me. I know I'll be back here, but probably just for beer and music.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes.  Everything about this place is great.  It is by far the best Italian food in Tampa, and from what I have experienced from the four times I have been to this restaurant, you cannot go wrong with whatever you order!  It is tucked away in a strip mall (per typical Tampa) and is pretty small.  They typically do not take reservations, so while you are generally okay Sunday-Thursday, I would try to get there as early as possible on weekend nights (they open at 5:30 and any time between 5:30 and 6:00 is okay usually).  \n\nThese people are true Italians!  They have Italian accents, it seems to be family owned, and they are so freaking nice.  One time I went on my birthday and they gave me my meal for free, which I thought was very kind.  \n\nMy favorite dish has been the pink lasagna.  It tastes incredible!!! I took part of it home and reheated it the next day and it was even better somehow.  I have also tried the lobster ravioli (amazing) and the beef carpaccio (also amazing).  \n\nTo sum things up: Great people, great service, great food.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"There was three of us that decided to gather here for a small birthday gathering. I was super excited to try this place, as I've had it bookmarked for awhile. I arrived separately from the other two, I actually walked right past the door thinking it was all part of Corso 32 (which does have a sign). I walked all the way to remedy before I realized that I needed to turn around... As there is no signage on the door, the window nor above the door where most signage is, this is important for me to share as much as if you are mobility limited like me, I'd suggest to have someone to drop you off at the door. The parking can be hard to find if something is happening at the arena, that night happened to be a playoff game.\n\nThe food itself was delectable, arrived quickly and the girls were very happy with their wine choices. Tip for those that are trying a few plates to share, order a meat choice to go with whatever else you pick. I suggest this as there's more bread that comes with that selection than say the cheese or egg choices. Believe me, you definitely want more than enough bread for all choices you're sharing as some played would be classified as good enough to lick the plate clean. Whatever you do, make sure you have room for the truffles at the end. OMG. Melt in your mouth awesomeness. I'm still dreaming of them, thus me writing this review.\n\nThe place had really interesting decor and definitely a fun gathering spot. However, if you're looking for a quiet place to have conversations this is not the place to go. As its a small venue, you tend to be talking quite loud to be able to communicate even with a small group. Granted, when we did switch to a table it got a bit easier to talk but then we had to always watch how we sat as it was easy to accidentally bump the person behind you. Service was quick and polite but it lacked a bit of the basics like making sure we all had plates, filling water regularly, asking if the girls wanted more wine or bread before whisking away with empty item. It got to a point we felt like we had to do quick strategizing every time we wanted something, by placing the empty item in a visible area but close enough to us we could slow her down before she vanished again. The bill was pretty high at the end but again the food was fantastic. Definitely worth trying again but I'll be a bit more aware of events happening downtown next time I try this location, as I think the fullness of the venue played into some of this experience.","stars":3.0}

We were a group of four and were seated at a tiny table that we didn't think would comfortably fit all of the food and drinks we were planning on ordering. There was a significantly larger table, also seated for four nearby so we asked our waiter if we could switch tables. Our waiter told us \"that's not my section.\" We then asked if it was still ok for us to move because we felt our table was too small. He told us that he would have to \"make a deal\" with the waiter from that section and let us know. We gathered that meant that he didn't want to lose out on the tips from our table and so we waited. When he came back he said that the waiter from the other section agreed to let us take one table from his section and add it to our table to make it bigger...tacky, annoying and unprofessional, but we obliged...\n\nWe first ordered the fried alligator as an appetizer. It took about 30 minutes to get to our table...the alligator was lukewarm and poorly seasoned. \n\nA friend ordered the chargrilled oysters and complained that some of them were cooked and some of them were raw. \n\nI had the fried shrimp, catfish and fries for my entr\u00e9e. The shrimp and catfish were both BLAND! I mean absolutely no flavor at all. The fries (which were basic frozen fries from a bag) were also served lukewarm. \n\nThe check took another 30-40 minutes to receive.\n\nOverall it was absolutely the worst meal and service that I experienced while in New Orleans and ironically, it was the most expensive!","stars":1.0}

Given our experiences, we were sceptical about Tableau, but we were in for a surprise. Starting with the warm bread, and the Demi Royale (the crab ravigote, truffle crab claws and shrimp remoulade were all equally amazing), then we go the shrimp and grits, and the grilled gulf fish curry, again both these dishes were perfect.

{"text":"This place was only \"OK.\" \n\nSean and I stopped in one night after hearing the mac n cheese was good and that they had decent burgers. I really like the decor of this place. Good job on that. But the menu is definitely all over the place. I wouldn't expect a chain restaurant to only sell African food though and somehow be successful (although African food is pretty much freaking amazing...and not just Ethiopian food, mind you!) so maybe they could be...but IDK.... I don't mind the variety if it's all at least 3-star quality, maybe even 4!\n\nBut all I tried was mac n cheese. It was only \"OK.\" 3\/5 stars for sure. It reminded me of the lean cuisine mac n cheese from the frozen food aisle. Which isn't bad, but why would I go out of my way to come here when I could just buy frozen mac n cheese? It wasn't sharp enough IMHO.\n\nSean had a burger. It was a little overcooked and they forgot the bacon. I also had a beer which was fine...pretty hard to mess that up. \n\nService was alright. The waitress we had seemed nice but it looked like she was secretly pissed off that she had to wait on us. I was trying to explain that Sean doesn't want pickles on his burger and she was just nodding her head but looked like she didn't really care. It was...weird... but the food came out fast and she didn't mess up my order, so I really can't complain. \n\nThe hostesses were really friendly, which is good because it's the first aspect of service you get as you first enter an establishment.

The bartender was extremely short with her descriptions of the beer they had on tap and the food they offered on their menu. I almost felt like she wasn't even interested in me being there as she was on her phone the ENTIRE time. It took forever to get my food, which honestly, was so dissatisfying. I took a few bites and pushed the plate aside hoping that the bartender would ask if everything was ok. Nope she never did. She just removed the plate from the way. Hello, a sandwich that had 2 bites taken from it, and you're not going to ask if everything is alright? Finally, I asked to speak to a manager, and she said with an attitude that she was the manager on duty. I was baffled, anyways, I paid my tab and ran the hell out. \n\nI'm also sure that when the owners read this review, she will deny it all occurring.

Even when it is crowded, there is often a place to find a seat.  The drinks are very good, with some specialties that you do not often encounter at your local coffee joint.  We really dug the Black & Tan, which is 1 part Cold Pressed Coffee with their Draft Latte on top.  MMM, it was a delicious and also did the trick of helping perk us up during that mid-afternoon lull in energy.","stars":4.0}

The bread was extremely soft and fresh.  The oysters and shrimp weren't just breaded, but seasoned well.  You also had the option of getting your entree blackened or fried.  One person at our table got the blackened catfish.  It looked awesome and she had nothing bad to say about it.  There were also fried catfish, alligator sausage all shrimp po boys at the table as well.  All looked very good.  It was just what the doctor ordered after an afternoon of drinking.  \n\nAnother friend of mine got the Jambalaya pasta.  The sauce and pasta were delicious.  They were not skimpy at all with the shrimp and andouille sausage.  \n\nService was great.  They were prompt and the food was hot!

Doesn't really have that \"Old World\" feel anymore.\n\nFood itself was good, but it seemed like *everything* was salty. Lasagna fritta came out quickly, but had a really salty taste to it and not much sauce to it. Breadsticks and salad were fine - about what I would expect. I had a seasonal offering (spinach and ricotta filled ravioli with shrimp) but again it just tasted too salty. Otherwise it was fine, it wasn't overwhelmingly so but enough that I could taste it.\n\nAll in all the new updates are very much in favor of this location, I don't think it would have been 4 stars had I review before.

This time we showed up REALLY early (sometime after 4pm) and waited in line (we were 1st in line this time) for the 6pm show. We didn't go online to get tickets because you really need to do that on Mondays from what I understand...and they sell out super fast due to limited number of seats.\n\nBut, this time we actually were able to get inside. we ate, drank, and enjoyed the \"in the round\" music. It was very enjoyable. The food was \"okay\"...nothing great and ditto on the drinks. But, we had fun and enjoyed our PACKED (yes, it was crammed inside) show.\n\nFor people who are coming in from out of town (like ourselves), expect to stand in line outside in whatever type of weather it happens to be that evening, and if you are lucky enough to get inside for a show, then plan to be packed in every seat. However, the staff handles the capacity pretty well once you're inside.\n\nI still feel that the owners and staff could do so much more to make the events more enjoyable and less stressful for the customers. They need to get on top of their notoriety that the Nashville show has given them and get some help with crowds.\n\nI'm glad we were finally able to get inside and see a show!","stars":3.0}

{"text":"This service rocks!! We have two dogs that are more like our kids then family pets. With that said, my husband and I have not taken a vacation for YEARS. I have been terrified of leaving our \"boys\" behind in someone else's care. Kennel boarding has never been an option for us so our vacations have been limited to places not too far from home where we could bring the boys with us. Leaving for two weeks and going outside of the country put me into panic mode.\n\nI started researching sitting services a couple of months before our trip and came across tons of companies. Most of the websites offered the same services, price ranges and glowing reports from existing clients. Nothing that really stood out so I started sending emails asking initial questions to narrow down the choices. Even had a couple of these companies come to the house to chat in person.\n\nKaren arrived at our home with one of the professional sitters who works for her and I liked them both immediately. The bigger test would be to see if Sassafras would let them in the house. He is the oldest and extremely protective of me and his territory. The first few minutes were a little hairy but that was our fault. Karen and Marjie took control of the situation immediately and had our second dog Douee wiggling his butt and looking for kisses while Sassafras carefully sniffed out the situation.\n\nI had several pages of questions for Karen including what her solution would be if there was a severe hurricane headed our way in which an evacuation was called for. Walk and Wag had a plan in place even for that eventuality. I hired them before our visit ended.\n\nI wanted to make sure that someone the dogs knew and trusted would be here at a minimum of twice a day. We also booked a middle of the day visit every third day just to let them out and have some extra playtime. Douee has severe allergies so feeding time can be a little more complicated then just putting out food for both dogs. He also has a torn ligament and required medicine twice a day. Sassafras is notorious for his Houdini like escapism so coming into the house requires a couple of extra steps to make sure he doesn't get out.\n\nKaren and her team handled every request with attentive care and lots of affection! (I sort of felt like they almost didn't miss me when we got home) I would hear from one of the sitters at each and every visit throughout the day. Even had pictures sent.\n\nI cannot convey how comfortable I felt by day 2 away from home. My husband was worried that our vacation would be one long stretch of me worrying about the dogs. If I'm truthful I would say that his concern was totally valid. YEAH! Not the case!\n\nIf you are considering hiring a professional sitting service for your fur babies please give Walk and Wag a call.  There are plenty of companies out there that promise to give the kind of care you are looking for while you are away. \n\nWalk and Wag with their team of professional dog sitters will provide every single service they offer! Every single time they visit your home! Call Karen today, you won't regret it :))","stars":5.0}

The service was friendly and quick, everything was clean (stop by the bathrooms, they're pretty cool) and I didn't have any complaints.

{"text":"Where do I start with my horror story. First, I was unable to get the two cars I had initially picked from their lot for some reason. I was just told I couldn't take them. Probably maintenance issues. Then when I finally got the right vehicle, the tire blew out on me on the middle of the highway on the first day. Roadside assistance was taking forever so I put in the spare tire myself. I then drove back to the airport and made it there around 2am in hopes to exchange the car but they didn't open till 4am (they are only 24 hours for car returns but as you can tell I found that out the hard way). After sleeping in my car for two hours someone finally helped me with the exchange. He was a nice guy but he said i needed to pay $35 for the blown out tire since i didn't purchase insurance. I guess it's not really his fault since he was just following policy. But the incident wouldn't have happened had they properly maintained their vehicles. Anyway, while trying to get another car to exchange, again I was told that the car I initially wanted was not available... 1.5 hours and 2 cars later they finally had a vehicle that met the standards to take out for rent. At least that last vehicle didn't give me any issues. Never renting from here or dollar for that matter ever again\n\nUPDATE: I canceled the additional driver on my second day renting but I was still charged for the remaining days. Furthermore, I filed a claim with an outside insurance company about the blown out tires but they need the incident report plus other documents to proceed. I called dollar customer service but they said i need to contact this location to resolve my problems but they do not pick up the phone. It has been two weeks so far, and yes I left plenty of voicemails, but received no call back from this location.","stars":1.0}

I just personally don't care for very uncooked meat. Just my little personal opinion.\n\nDessert Station SUCKED!!! First off it was crammed into a corner after the coffee station and right beside the 3 piece band. This event was for 200+ people and we waited in line for 15 minutes to arrive at ONE TABLE with 3 Choices of barely two bite desserts!?!?!?! Strange But True.  OK, it could have been the organizer's fault that the choices were so sparse and limited. It could have also been the organizer's fault that the tables were set up as they were. \n\nBut the planner's at Harry's should have made suggestions to avert these two problems. No one likes paying top dollar, even for a charity event, and then waiting in line for 15 minutes to get a two bite dessert.\n\nLastly, Who's brillant idea was it to build a ladies room for the LARGE ballroom with only three stalls??

{"text":"I respect Kelly's skill for certain hair colored customers but NOT ON BRUNETTE ones. Or maybe she was tired from her weekends and i am the unlucky one. ALL TH BRUNETTES, DO NOT GET YOUR HAIR DONE from her...\n\n1. I made an appointment today for a balayage hair style. She charged me for a balayage hairstyle but in fact, she performed highlights on my hair. \n\n2. Speaking of which, she was supposed to color new root hair based off my previously colored hair then highlight it with the light golden\/blonde hair. She insisted that the girl in the photo has natural brown hair. THAT'S NOT TRUE MAN. She had her black hair and dyed her entire hair with the golden brown and then highlighted or or balayage whatever to make the look. Regardless, Kelly kept insisting that she is right.\n\n3. Speaking of her insisting, I initially considered our miscommunication natural, so i suggested her if there will be another way to accomplish the hair look i wanted after her highlights. She said \"no it would be really hard\", like my opinion did not matter. So i said, we will see it at the end since she is the professional stylist. \n\n4. The highlights did not turn out not even lighter than my existing hair color thats been dyed two years ago.\nWhen i had my hair dyed, it took the previous stylist to dye it \"brown\" no more than an 1hour. KELLY took around 2hours to do the \"highlights\". So, I am so confused why it took her two hours to get the result like this. \n\n5. Other than the performance, she was not around me for about 30-40mins so it was like the \"dead\" time for me to realize that it is going to be not even close to what i wanted when i walked in to this hair salon. I dont need somebody to babysit me-i just wanted to express my concern because i realized that she was only highlighting my hair. \n\n6. She did not explain anything she was about to do. She did not even question or confirmed what i wanted. She did not communicate that much almost until the end which was quite awkward for me\n\nIt is really shameful that she did not want to take any responsibility to help me satisfy not even close to 50%. I told her i like how she did my hair but frankly, i did not ask for this hair. \n\nAll I WANTED FROM KELLY who i thought was a skillful stylist was to either help me walk out of the door with satisfaction or charge me less for the mistake she made for not understanding her customer's need. I was ready to pay for the listed price for her as long as she explained and guided me through the appointment.\n\nI got a multiple response from Studio K review and i dont think they are quite interested in really understanding their customer's needs. All she explained to me for that 2.5hrs about the hair was literally, \"okay.\", \"what do you want?\", \"i cannot promise you\". But she did not give me any single solutions or a guidance on how to look like what I wished. Very ARROGANT and VERY CARELESS.\n\ni had to come back on Yelp on 25th of March, and I am still unhappy with my hair and thanks to her unprofessionalism. Lol. Just make sure to go to her when she is in a good mood to get nice hair.\n\n27th of March.\nI am still very unhappy with her lack of communication with me and her performance.

I was surprised to see other items such as fish, salad and wings! Good to have a variety I suppose! Our waitress was friendly and personable as she was quick to offer us drinks! We settled on Gourmet burgers and fries! Bottomless fries I might add! Who has room for that!? My goodness! Bottom line, the service was great and so was the food. The reason for the four star rating is because the restaurant could've been a little cleaner. As soon as we sat down my purse immediately connected to a piece of lettuce residue probably from the patrons who occupied the table before we got there. The floors needed attention as well.

The crust is amazing and seems house made from scratch. The toppings were loaded and fresh. The sausage had a lot of flavor.

If it's your first time there and you placed your order online it's pretty confusing. I went  to the 911 address location. I asked a worker what line should I get in if I placed my order online. She didn't know so she asked someone else. She then told me to pick it up from across the street. I'm not a Nashville native and it being my first time there I asked her if she could point out the building for me. She had a nasty attitude and talked to me condescendingly just for asking for simple directions. What a moron. My vision is also not the best and it was at night. Smh. I went across the street once I get in I see my name lit up on this billboardlike monitor. I tell the cashier I am picking up and give her my name. She asks me for a copy of my email confirmation. I have never even my life had to provide a receipt for a pick up order. Maybe if you didn't broadcast who placed the order a better system would be to just give the person their order once they gave you their name. I had to go back to my car in the rain sweating out my press out (*rolling my eyes*). Do better. Customer service was nonexistent. The pizza was decent nothing special. I will never return. I get better customer service at Wendy's. That same night I went to Wendy's to get a drink because with the mental frustration I experienced at S&H I forgot to order my drink.

{"text":"Oh it's the best in Tucson, I can tell you that. \n\nBeen here twice first trip had a reuben, and if you like reubens you will LOVE theirs. Definitely a carnivore's sandwich grilled perfectly and the toppings were fresh. But with tax it's around nine bucks which seems steep for a sandwich, even if it's the best reuben I've ever had. Love that sandwiches come with a pickle and cookie too, such a nice touch. \n\nSecond trip I had one of their own creations the hilary. If you like turkey with a little spice you've got to try this. The panini bread was sensational and the combination of smoky and spicy was great. Sizewise this is much larger in length than the reuben, but again nine bucks for a sandwich seems steep. \n\nWhat I can't stress enough is just how good their bread is. I don't know where its from but you could swear its made there hourly its so fresh and so good. I know Tucson is a smaller town without a long deli culture, but I've never been to a sandwich shop that took their bread this seriously until today and wow is it a suprise when you try one with some outstanding bread. \n\nI'm really debating five or four stars. The sandwiches are out of this world and very filling, definitely more than twice as good as any chain and even some of the other shops I've been too. But is it worth the price?

While standing outside you can smell the waffle cones which they make at the front of the line. Nothing beats a fresh waffle cone, am I right? My friend I both (without knowing) got a half scoop of the salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks & half scoop of the dark chocolate truffle (made with coconut milk) on a waffle cone. Both really good, but the peanut butter was everyone's favorite. Our other friend got the goat cheese with cherries (he's a risky one), and loved it - he said it tasted like cherry cheesecake.

{"text":"As a regularly visiting cyclist (I live less than a mile away), I often ride from the Landing to Chain of Rocks and back. The pedestrian traffic is light, the route is safe, and the time spent each time has become a benchmark for my performance.\n\nThe North Riverfront trailhead is immediately north of the Landing, where you can park a car, and during certain times of the summer rent a bike. \n\nThe trail hugs the Mississippi riverfront between the St. Louis Landing and the Chain of Rocks bridge 11 miles north, crossing the flood-wall a few times for contrasting views of the river and the industrial underbelly it serves. The surface is mostly smooth paved asphalt about 8 to 12 feet wide with a paint-line divider for safe traffic in both directions with ample room for passing. There are occasional bollards to prevent vehicle traffic, so heads up. The majority of the trail is flat with only a few points with minor inclines, until you get closer to the Chain of Rocks bridge. After crossing Riverview road to bypass the water treatment plant the trail winds over two hills that require a little sweat, but what goes up... gets to speed back down.\n\nA few notes for new visitors:\n* some combination of time of day, temperature, and wind may make some sections of the industrial rather smelly -press on, it will improve\n* use the crosswalk signal at Riverview road and look before you cross -drivers may be ignorant of the red light\n* much of the trail is on the levee, exposing you to wind and sun\n* the wind is *always* gustier on the way back, it doesn't matter from which direction you began","stars":5.0}

The fries were thin crispy and delectable. The fish ruined the entire meal. Allow me to explain.\nPan-crusted should be on top, what they do is basically put the fish between a grilled cheese sandwich without the bread and pan fry it. The cheese is so oily and greasy and heavy, forget tasting any fish. I couldnt scrape the cheese off the fish as it was fuzed front and back onto the fish. If the fish was simply pan fried lightly on top it wouldve been a flawless rendezvous, and the cheese tasted like crisp golden cheese toast parmesan chips, yum, but mixed and paired with the fish was a huge, huge mistake.\nI am almost certain if i ordered anything else I wouldve loved it, anyways, a very solid place with reasonable prices, diverse menu, its just that I chose the worst mispaired item. \nTheir other sides like rice pilaf and cole slaw were also great.\nPaid $130.00 for 4 people all inclusive, with a couple of stellas, tip, tax, and leftovers.\nEach fish plate was $17.00","stars":4.0}

I've never done a ghost tour before but I definitely will do another one after this. Julie was super knowledgeable and so friendly and even a little funny. She is a vessel of knowledge when it comes to Santa Barbara and it's history. We were in a little big of a bigger group about 15 people . I kind of wish it was a smaller group but we still had a blast. She takes you around the area and tells you stories about the history of each place you visit and ghost stories along with it. \n    Whether you believe in ghost or not Julie just might make you a believer. She had a story about a ghost not Ameliana I believe her name was and how she'll say hi by turning on some lights and by goly some of the lights turned on. I dunno if it was a ghost or not but it was exciting either way. The tour is 90 mins long and I definitely recommend it. She even does a wine tour.

{"text":"We stopped by Batch on a Saturday afternoon, in part because we had a friend in from out of town who is a big whiskey drinker. They had picked out Batch to visit. My husband and I enjoy whiskey, so we decided to give it a shot.\n\nThe good stuff first: they have an extremely extensive whiskey menu, including some of our Irish favorites (Redbreast and Teeling). Although I often enjoy whiskeys neat or on the rocks, I was in the mood for an Old Fashioned. I had the OH Old Fashioned and enjoyed it.\n\nThe patio is right on Congress and was a fun spot to sit and people watch.\n\nThe not as fabulous points: all available seating was uncomfortable. There were steel high top chairs with no cushions inside and slightly lower versions of the same uncomfortable chairs outside on the patio. Even if everything else had been off the chain, my husband and I couldn't have possibly sat there for more than one round of drinks.\n\nThe bartenders\/servers were the biggest disappointment. When I come to a place like Batch, I expect to servers\/bartenders to be interested in talking about whiskey. At the very least, it would be helpful to get some recommendations\/guidance. When we asked our server for recommendations (both on the cocktail side and for a flight of whiskeys) he shrugged at us and said, \"Everything's good.\" Thanks man--super helpful.\n\nEven once drinks were ordered, service was slow, even though the place was not super busy. Aside from not having any recommendations and not wanting to talk about whiskey, servers were the level of friendly that I would come to expect from a big city (LA, NY, Chicago) and not Tucson.\n\nWe did not order any of the food, as we weren't hungry and it seems mostly like a gimmick.\n\nIf there is a particular whiskey you can't find anywhere else, this may be a good place to visit. Otherwise, there are lots of friendlier places in Tucson to get a drink.","stars":3.0}

I heard about the event thru FB and have wanted to go for awhile, but this past Tuesday was the first time I could go. The Jazz musicians change each time and so do their food menus. They have a good selection of Martinis and Beer for this event (not craft beer it seemed). Music was great and they band was very talented (piano, sax, flute, drums, vocals) great Jazz vibe. I have never been to the Skyline Club itself either, so it was cool to check out. The GM of the Skyline Club came around to check on us. He noticed us wondering around and checking out the views after the music was over and ended up walking around with us, describing the local art they had (currently Indy 500 related) and gave us his card for the future if needed. Great views, it's on the 36th floor of One America. They have a small menu. We tried 3 oysters ($1\/oyster), just to try out. I got the Burger and my boyfriend got the chicken wings, just something to munch on for dinner while we listened to the music. Burger was great, but wished it had more of that Garlic Aioli sauce (so good). My boyfriend enjoyed the wings and really liked the Tropical Mango martini.

{"text":"Also having driven and flown cross-country, the train is definitely my favorite means of doing so. The downside, of course, is that it takes about 3 days to get from NYC to California, plus another day to get down the California coast to southern California. But it's far more comfortable than a plane, relaxing, and a very social travel experience--people are willing to chat and play cards and such in the common areas. They also announced all of the morning football scores on Sunday, and gave updates on the 49ers score for the last few minutes (it was the only game still going at the time). There's no Internet, which seems to me to be a mistake on Amtrak's part--people would gladly pay a few dollars more to have Internet, even if just in the lounge car. I had my phone, and tethered my computer to its Internet, so it wasn't a problem for me (although there are definitely big chunks of the trip without phone or mobile Internet access).\n\nI went in the Fall, which is my favorite time of year, and is a great time for this trip. There are leaves changing most of the way. You go through fields, see farm animals, the Donner Pass and Donner Lake, lots of tunnels, and I felt a lot closer to all of it than I do when I'm on a multi-lane highway. There's plenty of room to walk around, and several stops each day for a quick walk outside for some fresh air (you'll probabaly have to head down the platform because most of the people who step  off the train are doing so to smoke).\n\nI traveled coach, which means sleeping in a seat. The seats have the size and legroom of airplane first class, and recline quite a bit, but I've definitely had better nights of sleep. I traveled on the weekend, so I think the train was unusually crowded, and I expect this is why I wasn't able to get my own pair of seats, which would have made sleeping easier.\n\nThe sleeping cars, which I wandered by because I wanted to check them out, were miniscule--basically 2 seats facing one another (it didn't even look like the seats reclined) with a bunk above--I think the 2 seats turn into the second bed. The sleeper cars have shared bathrooms, just like coach, although they have bathrooms on the upper level with the rooms, whereas the coach cars have bathrooms downstairs.\n\nDuring the day there are plenty of seats in common areas, so I was able to spread out and have a table and bigger windows.\n\nThe train was very well outletted--there seemed to be one for each coach seat, plus a similar setup in the louge\/viewing car.\n\nI didn't eat much train food because before I left I read reviews and talked to people who have done long train trips, and I brought most of my food with me. I also got off at pretty much every stop at which we were allowed to disembark, but only one place had a store, and that was a little train station convenience store with little more than is available on board, although there was more juice and milk and the prices were a bit better. On the train there are 2 food options: the dining car, with full, sit-down meals and a fairly rigid schedule and seating setup (required reservations), and the lounge food vendor downstairs in the lounge car. The former basically has one option for each of a variety of bases--chicken (which I heard was rock-hard), veggie pasta, steak, and pork chops. The latter had a pretty wide selection of soda, some beer (seemed to offer pretty much just Bud, Corona, and Heneiken, even though the train goes through the Sierras and ends in San Francisco, which has tons of microbreweries), milk (2%, tiny container), and microwaveable food (personal cheese pizzas, hot dogs, burgers).\n\nThe staff also left a lot to be desired--I get that they have to deal with obnoxious, unhappy people all the time, but I have to point out that they work in customer service. A lot of passengers talked about how surly the staff was. They are extremely rigid and unreasonable and rude. I think they'd get a better response and make things easier on themselves and everyone else if they were nicer.\n\nOn the other hand, the engineer was really friendly, and the tour guides who joined the train at Reno and stayed until Sacramento were quite good. The tour guides are volunteers from the California State Railroad Museum, and share lots of interesting historical tidbits, as well as pointing out some nice photo ops.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy I did it, and would do it again if I happened to have the time, but I don't think I'd take the extra time off of work to do it again soon--maybe in several years. Coach was fine. And I'd definitely bring food again.","stars":4.0}

I had one of the best chai tea lattes I've had in a long time! \n\nThe cafe is set up with the regular cafe on one side with the cat room on the other. There is a wall dividing with windows overlooking the cat room with a bar and stools. The cat room has a variety of seating options, as well as different toys and ledges for the cats. They all seemed to be having a good time playing with the people who were in the cat room. You do need a reservation to go into the cat room, but even if you don't you can always sit on the cafe side and still enjoy watching them play. The cats come from the Humane Society and all are available for adoption.

If it's not too hot and humid, it's worth waiting for a table on the deck.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The Perfect Place :)\n\nThe space itself was adorable - super aesthetically appealing. It was clean, cute, had bright fresh colors all around, hardwood floors, and even had a breakfast\/reading nook. It was perfect for us and our dogs.\nThe entire staff was super sweet and accommodating.\n\nPerks: Flatscreen TV (with plenty of channels), a strong shower, room service, close proximity to a dog beach, cafes, shops, and Santa Barbara. Washer, dryer, and vending machines on-site.\nTip: They offer wifi, but with a small nightly fee ($2.99\/basic, $4.99\/premium).\n\nWe will definitely be returning OFTEN :) It's super affordable, and met all of our needs.","stars":5.0}

How in the world is it possible that one meal can have so much freakin salt but somehow still taste like a shoe? I've had frozen burgers from the grocery store taste better. Guess what? I would have enjoyed anything on McDonalds menu better then the overpriced, overhyped crap I got at the so called \"Burger Palace\".

I do have to mention if you like your noodles on the saucy side, you may want to ask for extra sauce instead of \"regular\" amount of sauce (which is a choice they give u at the kiosk).

Went a bit downhill from there.  We waited a really long time for our entree which was the wagyu steak. The waiter came and apologized for the long wait.  When we finally got it, the plate and vegetables were very hot, but the meat actually cold and tough.  Felt like the items were reheated in a microwave and then the cold steak put on top.  Not acceptable for a 44 dollar dish.  Our waiter sent over a manager and she did take it off the bill.  We had waited so long and didn't want to wait for a replacement meal .

{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner, almost. My partner had the dry aged New York steak an off menu item recommended by our server she said it was fantastic! I had the lamb porterhouse, it wasn't lamb, I might call it Hogget if I was feeling generous but I truly believe it was more Mutton grade, tough, stringy with large bones. Whatever flavor was there was lost with grilling it on an unclean grill. It was cooked to perfection but tasted like stringy beef not lamb. Very unfortunate and definitely not worth the $55 charge.\n\nSave your money on the St. Elmo's world famous shrimp cocktail. Just grate a horseradish root into ketchup just before serving and voila, secret sauce! That was a joke it was fine but it seems people were just looking for the horseradish hit and not the texture or flavor of the shrimp.\n\nAll in all I still wasn't upset until the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I ordered was served. Overly aggressive torching reduced its potential glory to a burnt tasting top with two blackened spots, it truly should never have left the kitchen. After laboriously removing the top and tasting the custard, oh wait did I say custard? Whatever the product used to make the 'custard' must have been a egg substitute or by product as the interior completely lacked any egg flavor. Even worse it wasn't cold anymore due to the overly aggressive burning it received. No notice was made of the uneaten dessert by the waiter until after I paid and brought it to his attention. \n\nNot deserving of the $220 price tag for two with appetizer, salad, dessert and tip. Definitely off my list for places to dine in Indy.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I always need a wheelbarrow whenever I leave this place, but I always leave with a smile. The food is fantastic and caters to all kinds of preferences. This all-you-can-eat adventure starts you off with a menu with a HUGE selection of appetizers, meat, seafood, and options of either BBQ or hotpot or both. Though the price is a little steep, they do offer free meals to those who celebrate their birthday at the place (only on the day of, they will check ID). \n\nYou can either select the single pot, or share with the dual pot and have two broths side by side. My personal favorite is the pig bone broth, and the tomato broth. Both very light and goes with all of the ingredients you can choose from. Whether you like veggies, or you're all about the meat, you get to choose exactly what you want, how much of it you want and the food comes out so super fast. Before your meal even starts, they bring out small side dishes for you to start snacking on, all very good choices and can change up depending on the day. The layout of the restaurant is pretty modern and the tables are always nice and sleek. They repeatedly check on you in case you want to order more and they bring out hearty portions so that you don't have to constantly ask for refills. They also consistently change grills into new grills, and refill on broths if they notice it getting low, I love how attentive they are. There is a mini sauce station where you can help yourself, mix and match to your heart's content. \n\nIt is always busy when I come by this place, but it never takes too long for me to get seated.

{"text":"This started as an exciting trip to Busch Gardens in Tampa. I'm not from Florida but I have traveled the world and have visited many  theme parks. \nToday, 23 November 2021, my husband, son, mother-in-law and niece started at Busch Gardens around 2 pm and we bought the express pass ($69.00 each) to skip all of the ride lines because it's my husband and My vacation before we both start our next military duty station. We started off in the Emporium and bought super cute refillable cups. As we walked the entire park, we found that all of the rides were \"temporarily closed\" except the ride Mantu, to our knowledge. All of the refillable stations were closed and the one we did find had a long line and didn't open until 4 pm. The three disrespectful girls that were working at this beverage stand next to the swan garden sculpture and Iron Gwazi (which didn't open until March 2022) have no customer service skills. My husband approached the stand and asked if they refilled the water cups there and with attitude one of the girls shoot her head no. He shook it off and went back into the line with my mother-in-law. Finally it's there turn, they approach the counter once more my mother-in-law asks \"What products do you have?\" The girl behind the counter, with attitude says water. So, my mother-in-law asks if they have sprite and the girl just said \"water\". My mother-in-law said,\" Y'all don't have anything else?\" She shook her head saying no. We have water. My husband walks back up and says \"ma, they have coke, I'm looking right at it.\" The girls response was, \"well if you knew that then why'd you even ask?\" My husband told her his mother was asking and she wasn't telling her.  I understand there was a long line (as these girls who were working this station kept saying in front of all of the customers) but they literally just opened the stand and already complaining for everyone to see. As Military, it's hard to believe that there are such unprofessional and disrespectful people out there when literally all they have to do is go to work, put on a smile for a couple hours and sell prepackaged beverages. Other than this, the park was beautiful and there were plenty of photo opportunities. We got our caricature drawn around 7 pm and the lovely artist did an amazing job, I can't wait to hang it up in our house,Thank you for that experience. She was so kind and very professional. We made the most out of our trip so it still turned out amazing but it only takes one bad experience to ruin a good time and that's unfortunate.

The bar is full service, which is convenient if the sit down part is busy- you can sit at the bar and enjoy some snacks and mimosas while you're waiting! The food itself is incredible. The chef makes breakfast foods exciting and gourmet. I had the chicken and waffles and it was to die for, the chicken is fried in duck fat for a full 4 hours and melts in your mouth while the waffle compliments the salty taste. My father had the eggs apolline, which was a creole take of eggs Benedict with spicy sausage, crawfish tails and just the right amount of seasoning. The wait staff is also one of the reasons why this restaurant is the best I've ever been to. They refill drinks when they see your levels are getting low, but they do not hover or rush. I spent about 1.5 hours eating and drinking and talking, and after my plate was taken away, I sat and talked and enjoyed the bottomless mimosas for an additional hour or two with no one asking me to wrap it up- everything is completely take your time and enjoy. The staff will not give you your check until you ask for it, which adds to the no rush vibe. I could not be happier with this restaurant- the interior is gorgeous, food unparalleled, and wait staff impeccable.

{"text":"Sometimes, taking a different road can lead you on an adventure. One day while driving along Binford Boulevard, I got the urge to turn down 71st Street and see what was around the area. Of course, the upscale Kroger sits on the Northwest corner, but the street is also lined with small buildings and strip malls. It was in one of these, nestled between a bar and a barbeque joint, that I saw a sign reading \"Long Thanh Chinese & Vietnamese Cuisine\".\n\nAlways on the lookout for new restaurants, I  remembered the place just this afternoon and decided to set out on a food adventure. Long Thanh does have Chinese food, quite a reasonable sampling of entrees such as Moo Goo Gai Pan and General Tso's Chicken; however, it was the Vietnamese I was after. The only other patron enthusiastically recommended the Rare Pho, a rice noodle dish with rare slivers of beef in a hauntingly delicious broth, declaring that I had stumbled upon the best Vietnamese food in Indianapolis. While I need to go back for the Lemongrass Chicken (or Beef) and some Vietnamese Pancake before I confirm this, I will say that the pho was excellent. Served with a plate of bean sprouts, lime wedges, and stalks of cilantro and Thai basil (which should be ripped up with the hands to release the herbal fragrances and flavours), I doctored mine with some fish sauce (you may have to ask for it, but try it!) and pepper paste. \n\nThe thing about a really good bowl of pho is that you should feel really good after eating it. And after this one, I felt great - satisfied, not overly full, and like my body was thanking me for not shoving something processed into it. The price of $6.75 was reasonable as well.\n\nI may go back for lunch tomorrow. David, whom I gather was both the owner and chef, and his wife were both friendly and gracious. While I'm not going to say this is better than King Wok (Na Han Kho Do?), it's certainly wonderful Vietnamese for a good price on the north side.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Amis is delicious.\n\nNo really, the whole restaurant is delicious.\n\nGet the squid ink pasta with chorizo- it's creamy and perfect. It's black and will probably make your smile a little silly looking, but as long as you share it, that's fine. Both you and your dining mate can have black smiles for a little bit. The bits of chorizo add just enough meat flavor to offset the otherwise too luscious nature of squid ink. \n\nThe bruschetta bread is great: it's thick and grilled with just enough olive oil to add a nice juicy crunch. The imported buffalo ricotta is creamy, but that's about it. It's fluffy, but there's not much flavor.The salami, similarly, is fine. It's cured meat, and the beet jam is pretty good. If you put the salami on the buffalo ricotta, then you've created a great appetizer. The mild saltiness of the meat combines nicely with the otherwise undetected sweetness of the black pepper ricotta. \n\nAs for dessert, you'd be a complete idiot not to indulge in the tartufo al bacio\" chocolate and hazelnut semifreddo - even if you're allergic to nuts. Basically, you've got some sort of semifreddo mousse\/ice cream blend speckled with hazelnut halves covered in a dark chocolate fondant ganache. It's a hill of succulent indulgence with the perfect sweetness offset by the perfect bitterness of the dark chocolate.","stars":4.0}

Half price wings this Tuesday night so I definitely got myself some wings, but I also made sure to sample the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with baked beans. The wings were super crispy and were flavored with the traditional Nashville Hot Chicken seasoning. The exterior was dry, which was surprising, and the wings were super crispy. There was also a hint of sweet to them. The pork was delicious served with a side of BBQ sauce to go on my sandwich. The sandwich also had coleslaw and bacon on it. Everything is better with bacon. There was no imagination in the original bun. Wish I had something a little more like a hoagie roll for the bun but it still worked. \n\nThe misstep of the evening was the mix up almost resulting in me not getting my wings. Thankfully that was quickly rectified. Would definitely come back and recommend to friends.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"When I have a hankering for Vietnamese- which is almost weekly- this is the spot I visit. Why? Because the restaurant is clean, the staff are friendly, and the food is consistently good. The best part for me are the hours. It's open a little later than some if it's other local counterparts, which fits better with my crazy schedule. \n\nI like to order the veggie Pho and add sliced beef to it. With any Pho, I like to taste the broth before I dress it up with lime, herbs, hoisin and sriracha to see if it's good\/fresh. And here, the broth is always good without adding anything to it. So... CHECK! I also like to get the Crispy egg rolls. It comes with a piece of lettuce. What I like to do is wrap that lettuce around the egg roll, dip it in the sauce, and crunch on it! Mmmmm!!!  Takes the egg roll to a whole new level. Their Bun is also very good. When I order Bun, I go off menu and order a combination of pork, shrimp and yes, egg roll. Hey man, if it were against the law to love good egg rolls, I'd live in jail. And these guys have it going on with their egg rolls. \n\nOther delicious menu items include the Chicken Pho, the Rainbow Drink, any broken rice dish, and for desert- the Sticky Rice Custard Cake. So good! I give it a 3 only because I've had Vietnamese in other states (and countries) that have absolutely rocked my socks off, and unfortunately, I have to compare this place to those.

{"text":"Attempted to eat here during dining days. No need to rehash the details of that debacle as many others have already done so. However, my biggest issue with the experience was not so much with the weird bait-and-switch menu changes, but the way in which the restaurant staff handled the situation.\n\nUpon realizing the dining days menu was not as advertised, a friend asked to speak to the manager. After being left to wait for several minutes, we were approached by the visibly nervous hostess\/manager (really?), who was completely unapologetic and fumbled through a series of lame excuses:\n\n1) They had to submit the menu to the Dining Days organizers back in February.  Interesting, as a friend and I noticed that another restaurant had made significant changes to their posted menu on the Dining Days website only a couple of weeks before the start of the event. Why, Marigold, could you not have updated your menu similarly to reflect the extensive changes?\n\n2) At the time they created the menu they could not have foreseen what proteins and produce would be seasonally available by the time Dining Days rolled around. Shenanigans. Many of the options that were listed on the online menu were present in identical form on the ala carte menu, which by the way we were\"welcome to order from.\" Really, Marigold, you'll allow us to purchase items off the ala carte menu for nearly twice the price of the advertised Dining Days deal. How thoughtful and generous.\n\nFurthermore, when the hostess called to confirm my reservation earlier that day, there was no mention whatsoever of the menu changes - although by that point they had to be aware that customers were upset with the situation given we were several days into the promotion. Clearly they were hoping uninformed folks would show up and, despite their disappointment, shell out the extra cash for the ala carte menu items since they had already made the trip. \n\nIf you're not willing to suck it up and absorb a slight loss in profits while attempting to gain new\/repeat customers, why even bother participating in Dining Days at all? So shady. We were thoroughly disappointed and left with a very bad taste in our mouths despite having not actually eaten a thing. I don't care how good the food is, I will not be giving these folks another shot.","stars":1.0}

It is nestled in a tiny stretch of storefront businesses along Pershing. From the front, it's pretty unassuming. But when you walk in, it opens up to a well designed, modern, polished, and clean d\u00e9cor.\n\nI canNOT rave enough about the staff! By far the best I've encountered in a long time. I wish I could remember both the woman and man that we chatted with for dinner, but I have to say they impressed me so much in their coordination and anticipation of any of our needs.

{"text":"Two wood tables, two cool guys and a pizza oven.  That's all it took to have a great experience as I tagged along with two friends who frequent this place.  Pizzeria Beddia is a tiny little place that only fits two rectangular tables in the dining room.  Instead of finding the surroundings restrictive, things felt cozy and I was impressed with the sparkling cleanliness of the restaurant.  \n\nOur party of four ordered two pies and we were pleasantly surprised when told that pie #1 would be ready in 15 minutes.  I was informed, prior to entering the restaurant, that on busy nights it can sometimes take over an hour for an order to be ready.  We stepped out to buy some beer at a bottle shop around the corner and quickly returned to find a table for four set for us and our first pizza coming to the table as we took our places.  Prompt, friendly service.  Nice.\n\nWe went with two toppings on the first pie, mushrooms and anchovies.  I like anchovies but find that some places tend to overuse them and it can overpower the rest of the pizza.  We didn't have this problem here as the spread of anchovies seemed just right, allowing for a nice taste with each bite and complimented perfectly with the fresh mushroom topping.  The pizza is appropriately thin crusted with perfect amounts of mozzarella and tomato base. Served piping hot, each crispy bite was a delight.\n\nFor pizza #2, we added a little zing and went with toppings of pepperoni and pickled chiles.  The pie came out about 5 minutes after the first one and was every bit as pleasing.  The fresh ingredients made each bite a delight and the peppers added spice but, happily, didn't overpower the rest of the pizza.  In short, these guys know what they're doing when it comes to crafting a pie.\n\nPizzeria Beddia sits in a bustling part of town and my friends who frequent the place tell me that when there is a longer wait for the pizza on busy nights, the thing to do is go grab a beer at Johnny Brenda's or Frankford Hall and make a night of it.  There are no surprises here.  You place your order, the staff tells you when to come back for your pizza and you come back to have, what may be, the best pizza in the city.  The food is a little pricey but I walk in expecting that from a place that exceeds my expectations when it comes to quality of food and service.

I told them to forget it that I would go elsewhere and the manager came out to tell us that that is the way the eggs were supposed to be.

I tried to communicate this while at the salon but felt it was a downhill battle and would rather cut my losses.

The service wasn't bad either.\n\nNow for the only con: our drinks. My hubby had a regular margarita- on the rocks. The waitress asked if he wanted salt & he said yes  - it came to him with no salt. His drink was not good. I ordered the Sunset, I believe (the one with muddled blackberry). And mine was not good either. Both drinks were just bad - not too strong, not too weak - just plain bad. I think his had too much artificial syrup of some sort in it, and mine was either poorly made as well or just an awkward blend of flavors (sounded good on the menu!).  \n\nWe would come back for sure- because the food was great -but we'd just stick to water!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Very unexpected experience. The place has morphed into a high-end culinary adventure, very similar to Palate in Newtown ( about 5 miles away). Exotic food in small portions, although not as microscopic as Palate. Very untraditional choices served in unexpected ways. Some people likely will love this but had I not been with friends who selected the place, I would have left after seeing the brief menu. They serve \"small plates\" and \"large plates\" with differing choices. The small plates are quite small but the large ones are adequate. Short ribs were very good, hangar steak was tough, halibut was nothing special. Sides are essentially non-existent unless you order more \"little plates\". There are no salads  available except a creamy fruit dish they call a \"salad\". Interesting experience but not my cup of tea. Perhaps those who are trendier than I will like it. If it were in the city or a more avant-garde location like Princeton the dining room might have been more than half-full on Saturday night. For most people I suspect this is a \"one and done\" kind of place.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"All you can eat hot steaming main lobster for $19.99? You can't beat that!!! \n\nA group of 10 of us came for dinner at around 6pm on a Sat. We waited for about 30 minutes - which wasn't bad at all. During our wait, we signed up for the boomtown card to get the buffet discount (usually 24.99 but 19.99 with the card - there is also an Express line for 29.99 - no waiting). \n\nAfter being seated we ordered our drinks (included in the meal) then head to the buffet line. \n\nFOOD: \nLobster - very efficient line. The server mentioned that if you only want lobster, you can go straight to him and not stay in line. If you stay in line it only takes 2-4 minutes to reach the lobster. The lobsters are probably 0.5 lbs each - but hot and delicious. Some had tons of roe!!! \n\nRoast Beef - Flavorful and delicious. If you want them to grill it up to cook it more - you can ask. I also liked the sausage and mash potato\/gravy. \n\nAsian Food - I liked the potstickers and chow mein. My friends said the kung pao was good too! They also had the standard fried rice and broccoli beef. \n\nOther favorites - Corn, salad bar ( salami\/italian salad, fruit salad, pasta salad, standard salad toppings..etc), some had pizza, and pasta with clams, and lobster bisque. \n\nDessert - I really enjoyed the bread pudding. Others had pie with ice cream, caramel roasted banana, cream puffs, fruit tarts, carrot cake..too many to list. \n\nDid not try items cuz I was too full- roasted red potatoes, pasta with cream sauce, ham, about 4 different types of pizza. \n\nOur group ate about 40 lobsters and got our money's worth.

The meat that was used was some bottom shelf sliced spam generic brand. The olives were not good either.

Now that's just the service. The actual pizzas are the kicker, the dough is usually not proofed (which basically means it hasn't puffed up from the yeast and that jazz) the employees just grab hand fulls of stuff and throw them on the pizza all in the middle! I use to work at a papa Murphy's and they're supposed to measure out the ingredients. That's what you pay for!!

{"text":"Came here for a wedding this past weekend, and I have to admit that I was blown out of the water with how beautiful this place is. You wouldn't think so from the surrounding area, but stepping inside is a whole new ball game.\n\nUpon walking in, you are greeted by servers (I think?) and given directions on where the bars are, where each food station is located, and where to sign our names for the bride and groom. It was definately nice to be shown where things are instead of hunting around for everthing. Tons of tables to stand around to eat and a few chairs to sit at as well if you're tired (during cocktail hour). There were also very large bars and you didn't have to wait long for a drink at all. The rooms were huge! Didn't feel cramped at all. And when they opened up the curtains to the main ballroom area, it was absolutely breathtaking. Whomever set up the rooms did a wonderful job.\n\nThe food was catered by cescaphe and it was AWESOME. They had everything from lobster tails (yes, they had lobster!) to pasta to salad. I loved the pasta station and the seafood station the best. The crab legs and the lobster risotto was my favorite items. They also had servers walking around with appetizers as well. I only sampled a few of them, but from what I sampled, it was delicious. During dinner, you had a choice of Filet, Sea bass, or rack of lamb. Mmmm!!! So many wonderful choices. Then later on in the night, they had a breakfast\/dessert bar. OMG, how cool is that!? I got to eat breakfast at 10pm! They had funnel cake, chocolate cake, pancakes, omlettes, etc etc. You name it, they probably had it. So good.\n\nIf you are looking for a large venue to throw a party, this is you go to spot!

In fact, the pacing of our drinks\/food arriving was relaxed. \n\nGiven that a food order is required for seating, I was worried about the food quality, but we really enjoyed all the items we tried.  In fact, my two companions said it was their favorite meal while in New Orleans.  The atmosphere is lively and the musicians (Royal Street Windin' Boys) were outstanding; in general our 1.5 hours here was an awesome start to a great evening enjoying the music on Frenchmen Street.\n\nThe Food:\n- The mac & cheese: do yourself a favor and just get it.  Creamy goodness, with a perfect bread crumb topping.\n- Tofu Rice Bowl: a surprising delight.  You MUST order extra kimchee when getting this dish.\n- Fries: crispy and flavorful with feta cheese.\n- Fish Tacos: good, but not their specialty.\n- Pork Belly: I personally don't eat pork belly, but my companion said it was tasty.\n\nDrinks:\n- The Muse is a lovely cocktail (I'm a gin and St. Germain lover).\n- The Spagetti Western was fabulous....and boozy.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Great tire repair experience!\n\nI picked this location (despite the lackluster Yelp reviews) because it was very close to where I live and I was concerned the tire would go flat if I drove too far on it (fortunately you can inflate a tire with a bike pump + elbow grease, so I didn't have to get my car towed or drive on a flat). Service was fast and efficient as a walk-in customer, Mike the manager was very friendly and took the time to explain to me how the tire would be repaired when I asked, and they also honored the free flat repair coupon that is posted on the Tire Choice website (bonus!). There was a large comfortable waiting room with free coffee, TV, free wifi, large couch and chairs, magazines, and bathroom.  Appeared to be a big, new-looking facility which can accommodate many cars at a time. There is the ability to make an appointment online so I would do that (for non-emergency situations of course) to reduce waiting times. I will be going back to this business for my other needs in the future.\n\nI mentioned to Mike the manager that the reviews on Google were GREAT, but Yelp reviews not so much.  He told me that their corporate offices only care about Google reviews so they don't encourage people to review them on Yelp.  So if you want a more balanced picture of this business, check out their Google reviews too.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Pros: the staff here are super friendly and maintain their composure during very busy times.\n\nCons: it often takes 10-20 minutes to get a regular or iced coffee if you order at the counter. Also, some of the staff seem to have a knowledge gap when it comes to drinks and such.  One guy was unsure how many espresso shots were in a drink and another person didn't know which sugar free syrups you had and just said \"I think it's only vanilla\" he didn't bother to ask or check.  However, the most frustrating thing is the QA with some of the products.  The last few times I have been in there the iced coffee was practically see-through it was so light. It seems like they added too much water to it.  I've been drinking black iced coffee at Starbucks for about 20 years, at locations all over the country, so I'm not just being a Karen.  I've actually had to ask them to replace it with cold brew, which usually looks better.  \n\nI want to give them 5 stars because most of the people are nice overall, but some of the service aspects are lacking.  Hope they fix these things.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"First visit to Fleming's and did not leave a huge fan sadly. We sat at 5pm. First ones infact. Everything started out good. Server was pleasant. Ordered the filet\/lobster. Server said they had a wonderful lava cake for dessert that takes time to make, so he would check on us midway through the meal to see if we wanted one. Our meal came out and was very good. Though My well done filet came out medium well. Not an issue. It was still very tasty. Well unfortunately for us, midway through our meal a family of 8 were sat and that was basically the end of seeing our server. I was almost done with my steak and really wanted to order the lava cake, but our server was engulfed in a conversation with the big party about where he was from. Minutes went by, they were all laughing , and all I wanted was to order this dessert he raved about that would take 15min to prepare. A busboy came by to clear our table and asked if all was good. I said it was not because I wanted lava cake but or server was still chatting to the big table. He apologized and said he would tell him. Still nothing. The manager came by to see how the meal was. I told him it was great up til we lost our waiter to the large table. I explained I wanted the lava cake but at this point we had been done eating almost 10min and were not about to wait another 15-20 for the lava cake the server raved about. The server finally showed up and apologized. I said I was looking forward to the lava cake but would not wait because we had to go. He gave us a small box of truffles as an apology which was nice, but not what I wanted. So I left unhappy with my first experience. Maybe I would have accepted it better had they been busy. They were not. There was no excuse for that. I feel pricing is high very being everything is a la cart.  The dessert dilemma was the only reason for the 3 stars.

{"text":"Crowded. Noisy. Slow service.  But I don't care, because this was a fine meal from beginning to end.  And I'm ever-so-grateful they could squeeze in a party of out of towners, when they were clearly booked to the rafters.\n\nThe wait in the lounge was aided by the appearance of a Driving Glove cocktail.  At this late date, I don't recall the ingredients, but IIRC it was a tasty variation on an Aviation.\n\nOnce seated, I started with yuca, zucchini with beans and chipotle crema.  The yuca was not quite 'crispy' as advertised, but that's my only quibble.  \n\nContinuing my Latin theme, I opted for the chile-dusted duck breast with duck tamale and 'Oaxacan' mole.  The duck was prepared perfectly, firm but not dry, tasty as hell.  I can't vouch for the authenticity of the mole, but it was delicious, and the tamale was wonderful.  The tomatillos and taters provided some excellent counterpoints to the rich duck.\n\nCare with ingredients.  Care with balances of tastes.  Care with preparation.  The whole was really top notch.  \n\nA little cognac to savor while reminiscing over the meal, and then off to further night adventures in New Orleans.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I was shopping at this dollar tree with my two children when my 3 year old daughter had a sudden potty emergency. I went to the bathroom to find the door locked. I asked an associate stocking shelves and he said I needed to get the key from up front. I asked a cashier about the key and she replied it was out of order. I explained how I've been to this store before and I know that isn't true (This happened a year ago and I just had to find the right honest person to open the door). She called the manager, Angela. Angela proceeded to tell me the same lie while standing there staring at my daughter who was visibly uncomfortable and about to pee on herself. I had to grab both kids, throw them in the car and drive to another business down the street that accommodated her potty need with no problem (that's what customer service is supposed to look like). \nAfter solving the potty crisis I went back to get the managers name and try to get a phone number for someone in corporate that I could vent my frustrations to. I was told by another manager that the restroom was out of order and I asked her to show me to prove it (again I did this a year ago and know their games). She opened the door and low and behold the restroom was in perfect working order!\n I can't believe the utter human decency the manager Angela lacks. She would rather watch a child pee on herself then open a door. Ridiculous! Disgusting!  In retrospect, I should have just let my daughter pee herself right there in front of the managers office so Angela could deal with the mess. I don't have faith she'll ever learn what customer service is but I hope one day she'll learn what empathy is for fellow human beings.","stars":1.0}

Jewelry is my favorite travel souvenir since it's easily transportable and wearing it brings back memories of my adventures, so I googled places to buy silver jewelry in Tucson and Mac's came up as a recommended place. I'm so glad I stopped in after my lunch date! The store is unassuming from the street, but they have a beautiful selection of jewelry. The associate was friendly and remained available to me as I browsed, but without breathing down my neck or making me feel pressured.

{"text":"After reading rave reviews about this place, having a friend recommend it, and also being convenient to my new apartment, my husband and I decided to try it. Maybe I'm a taco snob, but overall, I wasn't impressed.\n\nThe good: the guacamole is to die for. It's fresh, it's chunky, it's delicious. The store itself is very clean, and the lady running the register was very friendly and helpful. She suggested a couple other things on the menu, but since I don't eat fish, I wasn't going to order fish tacos. \n\nBut the great things stop there.\n\nThe prices online vs in store are different, each taco starts at $2.25. Adding cheese is 25 cents more per taco. \n\nI felt the tortillas were dry and lacking flavor. They were sticking to the parchment paper, not cool. I ordered my take out at around 3, after the lunch rush. I felt like these tortillas were fresh around 1, and had been sitting there waiting to be used up before dinner. Definitely not fresh.\n\nWe had chicken and steak, and both meats were dryer and less flavorful than anticipated. \n\nWe ordered takeout, and had cheese on the side. The amount of cheese given was appropriate for about 4 tacos, not the 11 we ordered. There also wasn't enough green salsa for our tacos either. \n\nAlso, don't even bother getting the chips for your guac here. They lack flavor, and I would rather get some Tostitos chips. \n\nOverall, for 11 tacos (kinda small tacos at that) with cheese and a big container of guac, it was $33. Too much for the lackluster flavor and quality.\n\nIf you want real authentic tacos.... head over to the taco stand downtown across the street from the IndyGo HQ. That's where the real tacos are at.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Awesome staff, trained to handle emergencies. They do not overcharge, either, in my experience. (We have been on two occasions now.) My 15 lb rat terrier got a turkey leg stuck in her throat (esophagus) and i took her to a DIFFERENT, high-end, vet specialist group in Reno -- the dr at this OTHER place told me she thought it was a sudden spinal injury. I said she drastically changed the second she swallowed a giant turkey leg, but she did many expensive tests anyway and said spinal injuries can come on suddenly. Finally in one of the x rays they could see the turkey leg. It was a blessing in disguise that they referred me to Animal Emergency Center, who even took extra x rays at no charge to be sure of the diagnosis. They had the right equipment, and got Livia in for surgery immediately.\n\nThe original place I went to had quoted me $2300 for this procedure, and I ended up paying $900 at Animal Emergency Center. I was very happy with the Dr, the staff, the price, and the results at Animal Emergency Center after a very scary ordeal that would have been fatal if left untreated. I still can't get over that the other place told me it was a sudden spinal injury when all of the signs pointed to throat blockage. \n\nI'll add that Animal Emergency Center is a no-frills vet center -- which I actually prefer, because the extra cost isn't passed down to the pet owner. It was much more dated than the other place we went to originally, but the quality of care was 2000% better, and the cost less than 1\/2 of what the other place quoted. Thank you Animal Emergency Center of Reno.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Some time ago, upon learning that I had never eaten sushi, my coworkers and I went on a mission to rectify that situation. One of them brought up his experience at Minado and it was decided we would go there as it would offer me a great chance to try a huge variety and as much, or as little, as I wanted.\n\nIt was a great decision.\n\nObviously as a sushi newbie, my commentary on the quality of the sushi is probably worthless other than I was extremely pleased with nearly everything I tried. There was not one thing I ate that I found objectionable. Really, I didn't know what to expect of rice and raw fish with regard to flavor, but the 30+ combinations that sushi chefs create left me craving more. I'm a pretty adventurous eater who is willing to try nearly anything (and was also very hungry when we went for lunch), so I ate probably 20 or so different pieces of sushi. They were all very tasty--it was difficult to remember specifics about all of them--but among those that I do remember, my favorites were the salmon skin nigiri, dynamite roll, and panko roll. If what others say about this being not the best quality sushi, I can't wait to try a \"real\" sushi restaurant. Yelp might need to add a 6th star option.\n\nAn extraordinarily pleasant surprise besides the sushi was the selection of salads.... ceviche salad, calamari salad, hijiki, sashimi salad, yaku soba, a variety of cold noodle salads..... so many different choices and, again, all fresh and flavorful. In fact, the salad selection  probably would have satisfied my taste buds on its own.\n\nIf you are not a fan of raw seafood, they do offer a selection of hot dishes: teriyaki chicken\/beef\/pork\/salmon, whitefish, gyoza, tempura, udon, soups and several other choices. While the hot food that I had was quite good, in my opinion the salads and sushi take precedence.\n\nFinally, if you have room, they do have a dessert bar with [wisely] tiny portions offering options such as green tea cake, blueberry cake, flan, powdered butter cookies, fruit, and my favorite, coconut cookies (but that may be biased because I absolutely LOVE coconut).\n\nAs a bonus, you can really eat a large amount and it won't make you feel bad. Despite eating quite a lot of food, our party was happy that the light, cool flavors of the salads and sushi don't weigh you down like some heavy, greasy foods may. \n\nWhile $16--or $20 after tax and tip--may seem pricey for a lunch buffet, I felt it was well worth it. I am definitely looking forward to going again and trying all the items I didn't get a chance to try this first time.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Getting excited about Performance is like getting excited about Wal-Mart.  They are a large chain with a gift for undercutting local businesses with cheap junk.  On the flip side, some of their cheap junk is pretty usable and their staff is generally too ignorant of bicycles to be rude or pretentious, which isn't helpful but makes for a nice change from many small bike shops.  \n\nPerformance stocks low-end frames and virtually no components.  If you just need two wheels and pedals, they can certainly sell you an affordable new bike.  It will get you around and, when you have your first flat tire, you can put it in the garage for a few years before selling it on craigslist for an embarrassing loss.  But if you want a bike for regular use--whether for commuting, racing, touring, or mountain--you already know to look elsewhere.  And when you've got that real bike from another shop, you can go back to Performance and pick up cheap tubes and tires, off-brand SPD pedals, saddles, and apparel, all of which they do very well.\n\nPerformance has its uses, but it isn't much of a bike shop.","stars":2.0}

Very knowledgable about Square's long list of elaborate craft cocktails. He walked us through the various characteristics of the options we were debating about, and made sure we ended up with something to our liking. We were not disappointed with our choices! Seems like there's something for every taste and the drink menu is organized by liquor type to help you narrow it down.\n\nThe late-night small plates menu was fairly limited. That being said, all sounded very tempting. We opted for marinated shrimp skewers and truffle fries. About five minutes after ordering, the head cook came to our table to apologize for the slow service because they were cutting up fresh potatoes. It felt like no time had passed at all (plus we were enjoying our amazing drinks), but it was a nice gesture. The food was worth the wait, which certainly was not as long as he had made it out to be.\n\nVery happy to have discovered Square 1682, a very chic spot that whips up a mean cocktail.

{"text":"This place is. So. Good. I have really mixed feelings about expensive food trucks because I believe food trucks should be cheap (under $7), filling, and at least somewhat tasty. Most of the \"fancy\" food trucks in Philly are expensive (over $8), not filling, and only tasty in the sense that its a new flavor, but not necessarily objectively good. As such, I was really skeptical when deciding to order from Foolish Waffles, because it seemed like it would just be another overpriced novelty truck. I'm glad my curiosity got the better of me because the Banh Mi Pork Belly Waffle was litterally one of the best things I ever eaten in Philly and maybe ever. Yes, its a little expensive ($8.50), and not the most filling (I could definitely eat 1.5 of these, or 2 if I were hungry), but the flavor of it put it in a whole category of its own. Everything blended perfectly and well together, a rare combination. I would be willing to splurge and get maybe 2 waffles for $13-15. If you ever happen to walk by this truck, you should stop and give it a try.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This story is so unbelievable, you might think I am kidding.  Approximately 9 months or more ago, I dropped off my very nice Classe DAC 1, a $4,500.00 digital to analog converter off at Hi Tech Services and personally engaged Tom, the owner about the piece.  Tom sat in his office chair, never got up to shake my hand, look at the DAC, I was just another person with something to have fixed.  I brought it in boxed up \"carefully\" in it's original box where it would not be damaged.  The first thing they did was take it out of the box, said they had no room for a box.   I called and called over the next weeks, then months and always got the same story from the same lady, no, you cannot speak to the technician, but she assured me, they were working on it, (it needed a module), right, a module, what module?  As I had a back up DAC, I really wanted to see just how long Tom's company would drag their feet, well it's been 9 months and nothing has been done, and their company has not called me ONE time in over 9 months! During that time I moved to Memphis, so I was not getting back to Nashville, in the meantime, the lady that continually kept telling me they are working on my DAC, died suddenly.  About two weeks ago I called again and told the lady working for Tom now, enough is enough, look, no company could possibly care less about their customer to not call them in this length of time.  I told her, under the circumstances I would certainly appreciate receiving my $49.00 back, a fee I paid when I left my unit with Tom's company.  She obviously had no reason to offer me, why no one from Hi Tech Service would sit on a customer's product for 9 months and do nothing and NOT EVEN CALL THE CUSTOMER TO LET ME KNOW SOMETHING. She said she would be glad to refund the $49.00 and I told her I would be in within the next week to 10 days, again, I am now coming from Memphis to pick up my piece.  I cam in today at 2:00 PM, two ladies were there, no Tom and no techs.  They finally found the DAC with tape all over the top of it and one of the ladies shook it and everything was rattling around in the DAC and she said is it suppose to do that, and I said no way!  She noticed there were no screws in the side of the DAC, so I slid the top off and found 6 connections un-soldered, screws to the circuit board, metal spacers, quick disconnects ALL DISCONNECTED.  She said, well, we don't usually give these pieces back to people all apart, and I said, I called your office OVER 10 DAYS AGO AND TOLD YOU I WOULD BE HERE TO PICK THE DAC UP, and now it's been over 10 days, and I'm here and the DAC is still in pieces, what in the heck is going on.  So, she said why don't you call back and speak to Eugene, the tech who comes in at 3:00 PM, so I left and called him back. Very nice Asian man, a bit difficult to understand, and I FINALLY got to ask him what was wrong with my DAC, and he said some capacitors had blown and it was probably a power surge, and I asked why did it take over 9 months to get that answer and WHY did no one from their company call me at any time in 9 months.  They had no answers and the younger lady said, well we run about nine months behind, which is probably why he did not call, that's right, that is exactly what she said to me.  I called Eugene back and asked him if he had put my DAC back together and he said yes, and then I asked him, did you remember to solder those connections that were un-soldered when I viewed the DAC earlier?  He said he did not realize they were not soldered, but he would check it.  I said, can I pick my broken DAC up with the solder joints back in place, and all cables plugged back in with screws back in the circuit board and screws back in the sides and he said he would take care of it, so as of 6.10 PM on October 27th, 2014, over nine months after my DAC was dropped off for repairs at Hi Tech Service with Tom, the owner, personally, it's not even ready to be picked up BROKEN!

Sadly sounds like this was an investor funded project and not a chefs dream project since they canned him (or he left) and now it's literally flat breads and brisket for dinner when it used to be smoked pork belly gnocchi and delicious boar and octopus. \n\nLet me tell you about that flatbread too. We ordered one to share and it was a JOKE. I wish I'd taken a photo so you could really see what I mean. The \"bread\" part was thinner than a cracker and had zero flavor. It was topped with what looked like cut up hot dogs and spam, along with some mustard and ketchup. A child could have made this. My husband kept saying it tasted like an open hot pocket. It was also not really hot when it got to us.\n\nThey were out of 3 of the beers we ordered on our flight- and we wanted the pork belly tostones and those were out too. So we opted for the Asian tostones. I kid you not- these looked like they were frozen tostones made by Goya, with a tiny cocktail shrimp on top. Welp- right there, we paid our bill, called the Refinery while sitting at the table, and left. We finished our night with a delicious polenta elsewhere.\n\nDo not go here if you consider yourself any kind of foodie. It was sadly filled with amazing potential and the menu was inventive and truly culinary- and now it's a place I will NEVER step foot in again.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"As one who usually couldn't care less about cocktails--and even less about craft cocktails, patronizing the Libertine Liquor Bar had never been at the top of my priorities list.  When the situation to eat there presented itself, I found myself facing a conundrum: the Libertine or my usual Vietnamese (or Indian)?  I've eaten hoity-toity food hundreds of times; I've eaten Asian food thousands of times; I was blas\u00e9 about all of my Saturday evening choices.  I chose the Libertine.  How bad could award-winning food really be?  At the least, I could write a hoity-toity review of the place.\n\nI liked the Libertine Liquor Bar the moment I entered the door.  The decor is interesting, and indulges the senses.  The bar almost reaches to the ceiling, and I can only describe the motif as being something out of a Wes Anderson film.  The staff was very friendly, and quickly showed us to our reserved table.  While on the topic of reservations, I am glad that the Libertine accepts them.  Many places that appeal to the hipster\/trendy crowd these days do not.  Waiting an hour for a table makes a trendy feel even trendier.  For me, it is an annoyance.\n\nIn restaurants such as the Libertine, I feel that it is best to dine in groups, where each dish is shared.  This way, one can try an assortment of dishes.  I was particularly fond of the peanut cashew and bacon butter sandwich.  It has a pickle on it.  It is delicious, and it will help one truly understand the bizarre cravings of a pregnant woman. The pierogi plate was also fantastic.  Taking the cake, however, was the meatloaf--which is served as a sandwich.  It was pleasurably spicy and came with homemade potato chips.  Your cardiologist will resent you for this selection; your gut will thank you.  Last, but certainly not least, I recommend finishing with the Libertine's version of the cream pie.  It might just beat the one made by your down-home, Hoosier mamaw.\n\nAs aforementioned, I don't usually care about cocktails.  The keyword is \"usually.\"  Our server was well versed in the menu and offered great recommendations.  While at the Libertine, I tried three different cocktails: The Gathering Storm, the Bitter Gin, and Spritz Happens.  Far and away, The Gathering Storm was the best cocktail I tried.  In fact, it was so good that I would consider reevaluating my relationship cocktails.  It was perfectly balanced--and sure packed quite a punch.  The Bitter Gin, which also contains yellow chartreuse, was a distant second.  Spritz Happens was entirely too fruity for my taste.  However, other members of my party found Spritz Happens to be the best.  It all boils down to preference.  One thing is for sure: a lot of quality craftsmanship goes into a cocktail at the Libertine.\n\nIf you're searching for a unique place to have a great meal--and a superior drink, venture no further than 38 E. Washington St.  Your experience will be five-star.","stars":5.0}

Sadness was generated.\n\nI ordered my first of two plates and it took thirty minutes to arrive. So I handed over my second form, figuring it would take a while for more food to arrive. In this case it took less than five. No big deal. Service wasn't awful either so the place gets a 3.\n\nBut what that gave me the opportunity to notice was just how much rice had been added to the second batch of nigiri. These pieces were loaded up with so much rice that it was almost impossible, and somewhat uncomfortable, to eat in a bite. I removed some rice from each piece to make doing so possible again, and waited to see if they'd implement their per-piece charge for leaving food behind, which they didn't.\n\nSo, yeah.

Pizza made from homemade dough was good though, as were the typical bar fare (i.e. buffalo wings).

He had a rude look on his face. The way he asked if we wanted cocktails or were ready to order was so rude. It seemed like he was giving us an attitude throughout the meal. One of a few things I had noticed was that he came from behind my friend with a steak knife pointed at him without any warning. Shouldn't sharp objects be faced inward while handing\/placing it down? Btw, I do remember his name.\n\nOur bread, crawfish bites and jambalaya appetizers were quite good.\n\nRegrettably, my friend and I had ordered the salmon and scallop entree. The scallops were bay scallops. She took the first bite of it. She was quiet. Then she asked if had tried it yet. When I did, it was a mild taste at first until the end. It was pungent and disgusting. When I had suggested the server ask the chef to check on the scallop because they tasted like it was old, he immediately came in a defensive reply. \"Well we don't have a freezer because our scallops are delivered fresh every day.\" I want implying that. I just said it tasted old. Seems to me like they have had this issue already for him to come at me like that. \n\nThey chef had replaced my scallops for crawfish. Tasted a lot fresher. When the server gave me the crawfish, he commented, \"Those were bay scallops. Some people are more sensitive to them.\" Sure, blame us. We've had seafood since birth from Asia and the US. We were raised on seafood. I've never tasted any seafood that tasted like trash. Honestly, I've never spat food out of my mouth like that. It was revolting. Instead of making excuses and blaming us, he should have said that we will resolve this issue by discussing it with the chef and manager. I would have been fine after that. We weren't looking for free handouts or anything. I just wanted to let them know so that they can prevent the same issue.\n\nI will never be back. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.","stars":1.0}

We got our appetizer right away but $10 for 4 little scallops wrapped in bacon? Underwhelming. And then we waited. And waited. Service was spotty...you couldn't find your waiter if you tried. Food came out and although it was good sized, it just lacked something. For $38 I expected a great prime rib. This just sucked. Potato was good. I felt bad for my gf. She liked it. I don't complain.

Look for cars that have dogs in them and just follow. You will end up  on a dirt road where you don't see any parked cars from the distance. \n\nThe off leash dog park isn't really a park. It just is a huge strip of land with no benches and 1 trash can at the entrance of the park (no wonder most people here don't pick up after their dog).  It's NOT a social park at all like what I am used to in past cities I lived in (smaller, tables everywhere, people bringing chairs, etc). This really is a place just to have your dog walk around as it is too big for them to really meet other dogs and for you to meet other people. Bigger doesn't always mean better. \n\nMy dog and I were underwhelmed. We left after 15-20 minutes. \n\nI prefer the dog park at Virginia Lake which is better but not great. \n\nI would like to check out other parts of the park but I have to do a 31 slide report right now and I'm procrastinating reviewing on Yelp as we speak...","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I'm picking up some waffles and coffee on 7th Avenue in Ybor. My gaze travels across the street and I see a big sign for ice cream. Of course, I'm not the only one that sees that sign, my wife and kids do too. There was no way we weren't trying it out.\n\nChill Bros has around a dozen flavors of traditional ice cream and a handful of vegan ones. They also have granita, an iced based treat. The flavors range from typical (Oreo, Strawberry, Vanilla Bean) to adventurous (popcorn, olive oil, guava). The vegan flavors listed on their website include passion fruit, Oreo, mocha latte and peanut butter cup.\n\nDuring that initial visit my family, who are chocolate fanatics, went with cones of Double Down Oreo. I was pumped to try out the vegan peanut butter cup. Unfortunately, the only vegan flavor available that day was passion fruit. Not that I wasn't excited, I love fruit ice cream, I was just looking forward to some ice cold peanut butter.\n\nThe ice cream, both vegan and regular, were super creamy. I would venture to say it was some of the creamiest I've had. The passion fruit was strangely tart\/sour. That's the flavor that stood out. I loved that, while sweet, it wasn't overly so. The passion fruit flavor rose through that vegan cream and sugar. \n\nThe family were all fans enough that we headed back for round two yesterday. They went with the same flavor, Oreo. I was pumped to try something else but would not have been upset with passion fruit again. Alas, Chill Bros had no vegan flavors. When I inquired about it with the cashier she said Chill Bros is currently \"working on their vegan recipe\". She told me it might be like a week until it is ready. She also gave me a wooden coin for a free cone once the vegan flavors are back in stock.\n\nChill Bros would be five stars for me if they consistently had the vegan flavors listed on their website. Maybe, once the recipe is figured, that will be the reality.","stars":4.0}

Granted, we did need time to decide on what we were going to order, but we basically had to flag someone down to come and even take our order.  It was a Saturday night but it wasn't THAT busy...\n\nI had a chicken dish (have since forgotten the name) which was pretty flavorful, thanks to the added ginger.  It came with vegetables and was in a tasty sauce.  My friend got something pretty similar but had garlic instead of ginger as the main flavor component.  They were both pretty good and since we got them medium on the hotness scale, had a little kick to them.  As other reviewers mentioned, the entrees come with your choice of spring roll or salad with soup.  I found the soup to be really strange tasting, so much that I couldn't really get it down.  The salad, isn't really a salad but a weird combination of vinegary cabbage and other hard to determine items.  My friend ate his spring roll but didn't really comment on it, so I guess it was ok.  \nI guess after reading that this was supposed to be Indy's best Thai restaurant, I was expecting a lot more.

{"text":"1 out of 3 seems bad! What I mean by that is that I've only walked away once feeling that what I can do myself I just paid for. The first time I went in I decided that no matter what was going on around me that I was just going to relax & treat myself. After the initial time though it's been pretty much downhill. The second time I went in the tech I had totally robbed me of the experience I thought I'd have based on my 1st time. She skipped steps of the pedicure & then instead of bringing me over to manicure table, hovered over me still sitting in the pedicure chair & slapped on the nail polish. What was worse was my daughter was treating me to this for my birthday & they charged more than the 1st time. And while paying for it she also included a massive tip. It was only when we got outside could I tell her that I had a different experience the time before. And then yesterday I went in there thinking that the 2nd visit was probably a fluke & I couldn't have been more wrong! This time the guy I had could care less about the service rendered. It was not at all relaxing as he rushed through the pedicure including ignoring my request to please remove the patches of old nail polish (instead just painting right over it) to not rinsing off my feet & legs completely leaving slimy residual behind to using the same wet 'dirty' towel over & over on me when I could clearly see that the people next to me were getting an entirely different treatment. The manicure was no different. Only partially removing the old polish, to sawing at my nails while he was on his phone with earbuds in talking to somebody else to layering on the new polish(& missing spots) so quickly that it was so thick it never had a chance to dry even though i sat under a fan for awhile. As anyone who has ever been here before knows you have to pay ahead of time so when I went to put on my shoes all my nails were ruined because the polish was just blobbed on there in a hurried manner & the polish was too thick to dry. I'm not a confrontational person so the entire time instead saying something I  kept hoping it would get better. But when I walked back to show him that just by sliding my shoes on the entire manicure was ruined he said in broken E nglish(which was even more embarassing as I stood there for a few seconds trying to understand) what he was actually telling me was that he was off work now & that he's leaving. When I finally realized what was happening I looked at the other tech there hoping she would say she would fix it but they both went in the back so I sat down & waited patiently  but they both stayed in the back for a long time & then I heard the music get turned off then the overhead lights! It was then that I got the message. I had already paid so there was nothing I could do but feel humiliated & leave. So now I know. Never again.","stars":1.0}

That's what her attitude reminds me of. Not that it will matter since it is always packed and more than likely always will be. Even The Preacher filmed there.\nOctober 26th was seriously packed. We opted to go upstairs since there was no standing room downstairs. We were met quickly by the owner who was guarding the restrooms. (What is it with these restrooms?) We were also met with not a confused look but with a somewhat accusatory look. Not sure if she was afraid we were going to use the bathroom again (even though we all bought drinks and had them in our hands). Confused, we asked if we could go upstairs. Cold hard stare. Sizing our group of 6 paying customers up. Slow shake of the head followed by, \"Do you have password?\" Hell Naw, we ain't gotta password. What is this? 3rd grade \"No boys allowed in our treehouse? What's the password?\" I mean seriously. 2nd time I've been met here with an attitude as a paying customer who does nothing but praise this bar as my favorite spot. The music is always phenomenal but now I have realized that's really all. Drinks are hella expensive and if you buy cheaper drinks from the to go window, that doesn't count as being a paying customer on the inside. But, hell, even when you buy them on the inside apparently you are worthless to them as well. \nI have dragged all my friends and family here for 7 years. No more. I'm done. One day you are gold and invited in and stuffed in like a can of sardines to watch the band and the next day, you're left over Bourbon Street trash.

Are you part of that party?\" OR- \"I'm sorry but tonight there is a private party upstairs, come back tomorrow.\" I just don't think a cold, hard, accusatory stare and, \"Do you have password,\" is very courteous. Anyway, we were turned away and had to walk back by all the pissed off customers as we tried to make ourselves no more than 6 inches wide to pass back through, dodging feet, and saying \"sorry\" and \"pardon me\" over and over with dirty looks and annoyed grimaces. I'm done. Done with the review and trying to love the oh so elite Fritzel's for the past 7 years. Over it!!!\nUpdate- I was just messaged by a lady who had the same exact experience last night, who has been raving about this place for a year to her family. They were met with snobbery even though they had the ever so elite password to go upstairs. They were denied. More people need to review and stop taking this treatment.","stars":2.0}

I understand places get busy, but according to our waitress, they weren't slammed. I've been here before and had a much better experience. Kat, our waitress was great- she's lots of fun and it wasn't her fault- but overall I'll rate this experience a 2 out of 5 stars. The food was only okay, especially after waiting so long, I would expect better than what my chicken and waffles came out to be.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I had the hot & sour soup, spring rolls, and double cooked pork. My wife had fried vegetable dumplings and half a Peking duck. The food was very good; the hot & sour soup was the best I've had anywhere. The service was TERRIBLE. After our waitress took our order, we didn't see her for the rest of the night (I had to go find here when we were ready to leave).  The table on our left and right came after us, yet they both received their food before us. Even worse was the way the food was served (and I noticed this at tables all around us). They brought out dishes one at a time. A server brought my soup. When I was halfway finished, they brought my spring rolls, and a few minutes later my wife's dumplings. A few minutes after finishing my spring rolls, they brought my pork. My wife insisted, but I didn't want to eat my entree until hers arrived. I asked the server, then a few minutes later went to find our waitress to ask when my wife was going to get her duck. It was at least another 5 minutes or so before the server brought her entree. My food, still good, is now just lukewarm. First, you serve a table when you have food for everyone. You don't bring one dish at a time. Second, you don't take orders then never return to the table to check on your customers. There were other issues before we had even placed our order; they seemed a bit disorganized and not ready to handle the crowd. The food was really good, so I would like to try it again. But if it starts looking like a repeat of this visit, I'll just get up and walk out. And no, I don't care if they're under-staffed; they don't reduce the price so I don't accept reduced service.","stars":2.0}

We bought the house about 7 months ago and I don't think that the ducts had ever been cleaned -- 10 years of lint and dust in the ductwork.  Dean's showed up on time and took about three hours cleaning my air conditioning ducts and dryer vent.  I cannot believe the difference in the system's efficiency now.  My guess is that my air conditioning system is at least 15% more efficient now.  This was a very messy job and David, the tech, was very clean and courteous.

Final Ward was a standout, though. Moss \"paintings,\" thoughtful lighting, a distressed wood mantle, and very good service all made the atmosphere comfy and hard to leave on an unseasonably warm December night.

I shared with my girlfriend and could barely finish my half.\n\nWe ate in the adjoined bar and ordered frozen drinks (Smooth Bitch and a Pina Colada). They were tasty, but not strong enough to get you buzzed.  A homeless(?) man kept walking in and out.

A great place to step away from the hustle of Broadway and sit down for a nice quiet meal. \n\nWe started off with the pear martini and it was excellent. The complimentary bread and eggplant spread was the perfect snack that didn't leave us full before our meal. The calamari was frankly some of the best I have ever had, and that's saying a lot for the Midwest (I'm from the coast). The marinara was very good and the calamari was cooked to perfection. For my entree I ordered the ravioli and added chicken. The pink vodka sauce was exactly how it should be, not too much garlic, not too much cream, the perfect blend of flavors. The ravioli was very good and the goat cheese was surprisingly not overpowering (as it does typically have a very rich flavor). \n\nOur server was extremely helpful in recommending places to go aside from Broadway. Reservations were easy to make and this will be a must stop when we come back. A great place!","stars":5.0}

They don't have a very large menu -they do have all of the important stuff that you would expect from a restaurant like this along with the occasional Americanized side dish like french fries (just try the tabbouleh instead - it's good for you).

We both agreed that it was the best steak we'd ever had in Philadelphia. Our server and the water pourer were very attentive and pleasant and our water glasses never stayed empty. My boyfriend owns a high-volume restaurant in Philadelphia and has been in the business for over 20 years and we can both easily say that we received the best service here than any other restaurant in the city. \n\nAlso our server recommended the pork belly as a starter and we had the walnuty apple pie and chocolate cake for dessert, they were all delicious. As someone who doesn't like too much chocolate the cake was the best I've ever had from a restaurant. I think we've finally found a place we will look forward to going back to. \n\nI should also add that the hostess was so kind to offer to take our picture as many times as we wanted and in our choice of lighting.

Food came out fast, probably because there were only about two tables seated in the entire place...not a good sign. Food was pretty good, but my sausage was colder than room temperature. Unfortunately, nobody came around to check how things were, nor offered to refill my coffee cup. Again, I guess it's not that kind of place.  My fault for hitting the 20% tip button as I ordered.

The Club operates at 20 locations in northern Nevada.\n\nBarrel & Bites (formerly called vintage nevada ) is their annual  fund raising event.  Hosted in the large ballroom at the Peppermill, it seemed like a very successful event. \n\nFood was provided by Raley's (who's line I could have repeated several times- yum), Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and a few of Peppermill's own restaurants. The food spots were nicely spaced in the four corners of the ballroom. Southern Wine and Spirits of Nevada helped bring in over 500 wines from popular wineries. As well as beers and spirits. It was especially nice to see a few local brews and spirits and get a chance to try them\n\nThere were four themed party areas. The elegant speakeasy had Reno favorite Annalise pouring drinks and a fabulous Frank Sinatra singer.  The Coyote Ugly corner was whooping it up pretty loudly towards the end. Another western area and a beach were also hopping. And finally there was our own CM Michael in the Yelp booth testing your taste with whiskey or whisky.\n\nTotally loved their silent auction. Check in up front for the code. Use your phone or iPad and walk around the items and bid by phone.  If someone out bid you you received a message and could go back on line and bid again.

She selected to have $3 worth of green beans added.  The meal totaled almost $14.  \n\nWhen I got home from work, I opened the container and it was SWIMMING in oil.  The oil was leaking over the sides of the container.  Under the inch oil was several large chunks of tofu.

{"text":"I wanted to rate Baja 4.5 stars because I do have one downside to this great eatery... I don't like the atmosphere. It IS extremely clean, bright and sterile.  It's just not a cozy place for a date or a place to want to hang around in. That said, the FOOD!!! I think Mary Poppins  had just had lunch when she or Bert came up with \"SCRUMPDELICIOUS!!!\" My wife and I had spent a lot of bucks and time trying to find somewhere to replace Gloria's which while had great food the cleanliness of the place kept going down, down, filthy.  Really wasn't expecting much from Baja since it is a chain and the let down as far as the atmosphere. If you want sight seeing go to Twin Falls and drive down to Shoshone Falls if you want delicious Mexican food in a ultra clean establishment... Baja.\n\nHaven't had ANYTHING I would not recommend but if you like fish tacos or burritos or fajitas get the WAHOO! Never have I had a more delicious piece of cold or WARM water fish and consistently so. The next best to me is the Pork... Don't know how they do it but every damned bite taste like my favorite part of a pork roast... the heel. I'm having to swallow constantly right now just thinking about the blend of spices and just the right amount of salt. YUM! The condiment\/sauce bar makes it so YOU get to customize just the right amount of heat and\/or fresh flavors such as chopped cilantro. Wide ranges of salsas and other dips.\n\nGotta quit now....

{"text":"We are not locals, but were traveling through and looking for a decent dinner. I chose this place because it looked like they had a good variety of food for people with \"gluten sensitivities\" of which I am one. I ordered the Houlihan's burger with a gluten free bun. Fine. For sides, almost all of their sides were listed as \"GS\" (gluten sensitive). I would have loved to have the sweet potato fries, but after asking I was informed that they are fried in the same oil as their battered fried chicken. So I though I'd go safe and get the rice which was labeled GS. I realized after having a few bites that the rice is seasoned with soy sauce, which their wait staff and manager were both unaware contains wheat. The manager came over and apologized, but offered nothing else than \"I'm really sorry about that.\" So disappointing to think you have choices and that the kitchen is paying at least some attention to what they are doing only to find out that their menu is grossly ignorant of what food actually contains gluten. I won't be going back.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Desi Vega's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I personally feel that once you start a food chain with fine dining restaurants, the experience begins to wane. Whether in food quality, service or just ambiance, it can all start to go south normally because what was once a unique experience ends up with too many people putting their touch on different locations. Now I also believe, \u00a0if the owner grew up in the industry (server, back waiter, chef, etc) and is groomed by the right business owner, they have a better idea of what it takes to maintain standards, and know exactly what type of experience your guest wants to have. \n\n @desivegasteaks has been on my list for quite some time. but once I heard about the recent racial discrepancies, it made me uneasy. Nevertheless, I made my reservations for dinner at the Metairie location.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once we arrived, we were seated right away. The restaurant was very busy. The waters were poured and the menus were placed. As we reviewed the menu, out came a small complementary meatball. Marvelous. The sauce was wonderful.\u00a0 After I ate the meatball, I wouldn't let them take my plate because I knew that sauce would pair great with the French bread.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For cocktails, I ordered the \"Bourbon Bramble\", and my date ordered the \"Rosemary orange Margarita.\" Both were strong and full of flavor.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now let's dig in. I started with the soup of the day, Crab and poblano. That soup was rolling! It was rich, smooth, perfect level of heat, and you can taste and see lumps of crabmeat. I also ordered the crab cake. I did not like it at all. It was fully breaded and fried and smothered in a sauce. The sauce was very tangy.\u00a0 It said chili aioli sauce, it was more of a remoulade. I sent it back, unfortunately. I also ate the Caesar salad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For my main course, I wanted lamb chops, however I was told this location did not offer them (see my previous point about food chains). So instead I ordered a filet and added scallops, and my date ordered \"Twin tails\", which were two lobster tails. Both dishes were heavenly. My steak was cooked to perfection and the scallops were seared perfectly. The lobster tails were cooked beautifully.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Our sides were potatoes au gratin and grilled asparagus. The potatoes were so cheesy and buttery. The asparagus were grilled and I added hollandaise. Excellent choice on my end. LOL! Lindsey was great, her team was even better. I must try the downtown location and those chops.","stars":4.0}

Now I live in Miami, FL, but whenever I am home to visit, I always make sure Roman Delight is one of our stops.\n\nThe food is always fantastic, fresh, and tasteful. I agree with the other reviewer here: their Chicken Alla Rosa is their best dish. For an appetizer though, if you like buffalo wings, you must try their boneless wings. They are phenomenal. They bring garlic knots to the table right away, which are the best garlic knots I've ever had: slathered in garlic and olive oil, they have to be terrible for your health, but I could make a meal out of them. Pizza is pretty typical pizza, but it's great. \n\nThe only downside is that they have such a high pizza-maker and server turnover. I don't think I've had the same waitress twice in many years. The pizza also has not been very consistent, which makes me think they have had turnover in that area as well. The service is always high-quality, but it would be nice to have a little consistency. \n\nOverall though, for a hometown Italian restaurant, they consistently turn out amazingly delicious food at reasonable prices. I will always love Roman.","stars":4.0}

Central Grocery? Yes, you can get a good muffuletta if they happen to have all the right meats when they pre make them and now they hardly put any meat in them.  If you want a good muffuletta, go to Tags on Judge Perez.  Cafe du monde? - their pretty consistent but ever since the owner franchised his brand through out LA and Japan its really not the same.

A gentleman walked by and I asked if he was the owner.  He told me he was and explained the story behind the restaurant and that he was from New Orleans too.  He told me he tried to take a little bit from all of his favorite local restaurants.  Then he pointed to the bar and said \" Thats the same bar you will see at Parkway Bakery.\" BAMMMM  I WAS FLOORED!!!!  Thats why it seemed so familiar!!!\nI ordered a shrimp Po boy and a cup of gumbo and I am telling you ..I felt like I was home.

We were hopeful we would have a similar experience and we are extremely pleased with the new roofs on our house, garage and patio cover.  From the initial consultation and estimate, Steve was professional and informed us on the scope of the work, areas of concern and likely duration for completing the job.  Steve was flexible in scheduling the start of the project as we worked to get finances in place.  Before commencing the work, we were informed of what we needed to prepare: moving plants and other items away from the house, covering items in the garage, etc.  We were kept informed throughout the process.  Steve took care of obtaining the permit and scheduling the inspection.  The crew worked efficiently and did an outstanding job of cleaning up each night.  There was good attention to detail as old vent pipes were removed and holes canceled, wood replaced as needed and all metal painted to match the color of the roof.  Steve was on site to monitor progress and was readily available by phone, text or email, even answering a call on Sunday evening to discuss forthcoming work.

My bf was visiting, he wanted breakfast\/brunch before my shift, so thanks to Yelp we ended up here. The parking lot is huge since it's in a shopping center (shared with Pho 999 btw) and looks like pretty unassuming place when you park, but it looks like a completely different place once you enter. The menu is so extensive! I would describe it as Hawaiian\/American fusion with a full bar. We ordered the loco moco breakfast and chicken fried steak. The loco moco came with mac salad, rice, and a fried egg - just as you would expect. The burger and mac salad however weren't seasoned well - just a little more salt or something would make it way better. Chicken fried steak though - super yummy.

{"text":"I have not shot a gun in many years. My wife and I just bought a Glock 9\/19. So this was also my first time shooting the weapon as well. Went to this range on March 16th 2017 around 3:45pm. Traffic of course wasn't great but the parking lot was welcoming. Plenty of space and easy to figure out the entrance and exits. You aren't allowed to holster your weapon but that was okay. Going in for the first time was kind of confusing trying to find where the counter was or who to speak with in regards to using the range. With a little guidance, my 12 year old daughter and myself found targets (an Osama bin laden target) and the counter yet for the range. $15 dollars a person shooting on your lane. Lane times are usually an hour but if they aren't really busy you can shoot as long as you want. Prices are fair for lane rentals, targets and ammo. They offer guns for rent, but maybe next time. I think the eye and ear protection was included in the lane rental. Went to my lane and everything was easy to figure out (if your a first timer at a range). But if you had any questions, these people were very knowledgeable and easy to speak with. I loved the zombie targets (walking dead fan)! We were required to clean up our shells. Which is reasonable. Just didn't like the guy next to me having his shells eject onto my lanes floor. But not a big bother. Place was very clean and well organized. Oh and you have to have an ID and sign a waiver. Write your check in time in a book and your check out time. Really there's nothing complicated. The climate in the range is very seasonally controlled. I would recommend this range to everyone. Novice to experienced. If anything changes in quality, I will update my review. Thanks for reading.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Located adjacent to School of Rock Carmel, if you don't know what you're looking for you'll miss this place. I was going to see a friend's band play and had to circle around. The entrance is somewhat confusing. I wasn't sure how to enter because there were people in the beer garden and brewing equipment as you walk in the door. \n\nThe bartender had her hands full with people hanging around distracting from guests wanting to order. They have several of their own drafts on tap as well as many bottled beers to choose from, but they wait can be long. I don't know if they have a menu, but wasn't offered one while I was there. \n\nApparently they allow dogs and very drunk guests, which was somewhat annoying when they'd cause a commotion (the human more so than the four legged friends getting to know each other). Their website has a calendar, but its not current. The restroom situation leaves much to be desired with a single stall for women and the line grew while I was there. \n\nWith so many other breweries to choose from in the Indianapolis area, I think they need to step up their game.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"You know, I really wanted to love this place. Their prices are excellent and I prefer to buy local. I bought a large (14\") pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. It was seriously $7.51.  They do cut their pizzas into squares instead of triangles for whatever reason. That is seriously one of my pet peeves. Makes no sense whatever. Once I got the pizza home, it was totally limp. Maybe it would have been crisper if I had eaten some of it there, but there are like 3 tables and there is zero ambiance. If that was extra cheese, I can't imagine what regular cheese is like.

{"text":"This is BF and my second experience of staying in a B&B.  The first time was at an upscale B&B in San Diego.  In comparison, Bath Street Inn was more homey and intimate.\n\nThe rooms at Bath Street Inn was a bit rustic but charming nonetheless.  We stayed at Partridge room which was less feminine compared to the other rooms.  It's located on the second floor and has direct access to both the back door leading to the patio\/small parking and to the mini library\/cozy reading area located on the third floor.  There's also a small private balcony off the bathroom.  The bed and pillows were softer than what we're accustomed to but we still slept good.  \n\nBreakfast was served rather early from 8am to 9:30am.  1st course was Fresh fruit, homemade granola with low fat yogurt, coffee and orange juice.  2nd course was eggs Florentine and blueberry muffins.  Each serving was in small portions but it definitely adds up.  During our breakfast, Mary and the other staff (sorry I didn't get her name) were both very attentive and kind.  \n\nWhat I liked most about Bath Street Inn is the overall house layout and atmosphere that makes it easier for guests to socialize with other guests if they want to.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Where can I begin?\n\nWent there on a date in which my date arrived early and was hit on by our waiter several times until I arrived. But wait, he continues to do so while I was there. Strike one.\n\nDon't get me wrong, however, he didn't do so often while he was there because he only came to our table a total of three times over a two hour period and never with what we asked in addition to what we ordered (i.e. another glass of water, a fork, the bill, etc.). Strike two.\n\nSpeaking of the clearly poor customer service, I ordered lemonade which took me 30 minutes to get because it was \"coming.\" I expected to be blown away by the taste of freshly crushed lemons in some honey-based liquid. Alas, it tasted like something a step above warm Minute Maid lemonade. Strike three.\n\nWith three strikes most people are out of the game, right. Not really, you ever play something baseball related game (softball, \"piggy,\"  strike out, etc.) with somebody who refuses to leave the batting position. Well that's this spot.\n\nWe (remember I was on a date) were now late for two movies that started because we thought we could just pick up some grub and drive down the street to Glendale Mall. We were finally smart enough to ask for the bill when he arrived to our table with our main meals (of course winking at my date). The bill came and it totaled nearly $60 which I was floored over because all we ordered were hummus, two entrees, one late lemonade, one sprite, and a hookah. A small order of food + not so good (but not terrible) = high bill. Strike four.\n\nLastly, I began to feel extremely bloated while eating my meal prior to us leaving for the flick. During the movie I had no appetite for anything such as popcorn, etc. Because it was rumbling like a Tums or some other ant-acid commercial. I have been nursing clearly food poisoning symptoms since eating at this (insert expletive) place such as vomiting, diarrhea, the runs (and I mean the sprinting), and headaches. This is not good especially when I have to give lectures at work on a stage. I now appear to my students as a person in need for Flomax. Strike five-ten.\n\nIf this were that baseball-like game with that person who refuses to get off the batters box but is striking out, then at this point me and the other kids are whooping that (insert expletive) and taking the bat away. I had high hopes for this place being a vegetarian, a muslim, a traveller, and a foodie. We went on a Monday so I didn't experience the mad rush of drunken Broad Ripple-ites, it was only four other tables with people in the whole place. Minor positives: location and parking are great, ambiance is fabulous, and hookahs are cool.\n\nSadly, that was the last date with the person I went to but more importantly this will be the last time I care to venture into this place.\n\nOne","stars":1.0}

Mama Bear's is a pretty standard dive - just a jukebox, a smoky room, a bunch of ashtrays and semi-antique video poker machines, and one long bar full of people who drink like they mean it. No one comes to Mama Bear's to sip on artisan microbrews.\n\nI guess a dive bar is defined by its clientele. And so in a way, it's unfair to review dives  at all, because it all boils down to \"this is my crowd\" or \"this is not my crowd.\"\n\nBut Mama Bear's is almost never my crowd. In the half-dozen times I've been there, there's always been at least someone who was profoundly annoying. Amped up roid-heads, deranged semi-homeless, women who lose the ability to control the volume of their voices, girls who get too drunk to take care of themselves and spend the evening literally bouncing off the other patrons, jukebox warriors with horrible taste...\n\nI can only really think of one reason someone would drink at Mama Bear's: the Gold Dust West kicked them out for the twin sins of getting too drunk and not betting enough.
