If I could order an additional salad and have room for it I would. Our go-to entrees are the veal and the rack of lamb, but it's work waiting to hear the specials before deciding. We've had just about everything on the menu and love it all! My favorite thing to order is the cheesecake. It's made with marscapone cheese and so unique in taste. Sometimes we'll pick up to-go cheesecakes just for dessert. Is it pricey? Yes, you need to be prepared as this is not typical for 4 Corners or Spring Hill in general, but it is so worth it!!","stars":5.0}

( and we just returned from a trip to Mexico) I ordered the chiliquilies with chorizo and my partner ordered the breakfast burrito which includes chorizo and is a huge burrito served over hash browns. The homemade enchilada sauce is the best I've ever had and the portions are quite large. The heat is just perfect and flavours that you don't find many places around here. Give it a try ! They also have basic menu items like a minute cristo, American breakfast, biscuits and gravy and sandwiches not exclusively Mexican food.","stars":5.0}

I honestly thought maybe it had closed and was walking back to my hotel when I walked right past it on my way to another coffee shop. So glad I was able to find it. I opted for the Mocha. It's so creamy and delicious. The chocolate\/mocha flavor is on point. Not too bitter, literally the perfect mix of dark and milk chocolate. Definitely the grab your coffee and go kind of place. A few stools for sitting but not any overly comfy spot for sipping and relaxing. My only wish is that they had a larger food selection and more of an outdoor seating area. But I will definitely be back. Maybe even before I head back home to Cincinnati today.","stars":4.0}

The food was excellent as well as the service-we had an attentive waitress who got the orders and checks correct and the Mgr checked in with us even after we finished our meals. We shared a few appetizers like the tasty tender Korean beef bbq skewers coked to perfection and the tomato flatbread which was also a great starter that was prepared perfectly. I had the Norwegian salmon salad with Jicama strips which hit the spot. The rest of the group all enjoyed their selections and I heard lots of complimentary oo's and ah's throughout the meal.

I've heard so many wonderful things and as a New York food snob I was curious. I also heard about a new hotel connected to this esteemed restaurant . Epicurean . Wow sounded amazing . After an hour on the computer and the phone, I finally managed to get someone, only to find out that booking at epicurean does not mean you can get a reservation at Berns. Really?!! Oh there was an extra charge to connect to the restaurant but you had to call Berns and make a reservation. So I did. And no, Ellen, unless you want to eat at 10pm ,no dice.

She also let me know that they would be closing on the next monday for renovations for a week. BUT heres where it gets good.

Dropped the wig off,- the team there was friendly helpful, and the shop, although about to go under renovation was VERY tidy and orderly. Monday came, and I got an amazing personal text message from Suzan letting me know not only was my wig ready, but that it turned out great, and she had even fixed a small tear in the lace, at no additional charge.

{"text":"I've been here for several months and purposely waited to write a review so that it would be a fair and well rounded one. While the location is great and certain features drew me in (the staff are always very nice too!) - I am currently shopping for a new apartment as there aren't nearly enough positives to keep me here. The move in process was absolutely HORRENDOUSLY unorganized. There was no cart for me to use (which was promised) and was told it's MY job to go around to each building to find one (what a nice welcome). The air conditioning wasn't working so I had to move in and deal with 81+ degrees in the summer for a few days before it was fixed!! Since parking was horrible they had INCOMPETENT valet that I avoided at all costs. I had a mouse visitor 5 months in and I'm on the top floor so I can't imagine what lower floors got but I know 7th floor residents encountered it as well. There was a fly and fruit fly issue (must've come through the vents) for several months. During windy storms, sawdust pushed out from the cracks between the floor and walls that I had to keep cleaning up. While the pool area is nice, riff raff just come in and hop the fence when they feel like it and brag that they do so. During the first snow storm, I was plowed in and told I could not borrow a shovel (held in the next room) to get out. Luckily I snagged one lying around from the construction workers. NOW I see they have went as far as ticketing and towing cars in CLEARLY MARKED parking spots! The morning of the storm they sent out a map of where we could park and these cars had every right to park where they did according to the map. A phone call to those residents would have taken only a minute but they don't care. Long story short, THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH IT!! For what we pay, we should be treated MUCH better. They do not care one bit about their residents!!","stars":2.0}

The next time, they delivered food, it was called and they overcharged us by almost $15. When I called they were rude and wouldn't refund me my money. Their food is mediocre at best and their attitudes are even worse. Save the trouble and order from Lucky Star or Ping Pong.","stars":1.0}

Large, spangled dancers, some using walkers, shamelessly desported on the tiny dance floor. Most of the pool players brought their own cues.

Two days later I called and he had clearly forgotten about me and told me it would be 3 more days to simply price the items I wanted. I told him it was unprofessional that he kept me waiting two days and that I had to track him down to get more excuses, he said I can work with someone else if I want to and hung up on me. The next salesman I worked with, was more punctual, but also unprofessional, rude, and an incompetent salesman. One would STRONGLY assume that there would some incentive offered to rectify the outrageous treatment I had received from the first tough guy salesman. No. Nothing. Not a dime. It's almost like they don't want you to spend money there! After two bad experiences with these \"salesman\", I have a strong impression that apathy and\/or contempt for the customers is the rule, not the exception at Sprintz.

I understand that there are alot if people that need help but who wants to hear screaming and yelling in what is supposed to be a peaceful environment. One last thing.

Now, not being a very big seafood lover at all, he was hesitant. But seeing they had a full Chinese food lunch menu eased his mind. We were sat and I quickly realized the caliber of restaurant in which we sat. The seafood selections are amazing! Seriously! Flounder, crawfish, and jellyfish!? I showed my husband the Jelly Fish salad on the menu and he kept reading not saying much. When it came time to order, he ordered the General Chicken off the lunch menu, and surprised me completely by also ordering the Jelly Fish salad! Normally I am always pushing him to try new things, but this time he did it all on his own!!! Yelp is making him explore more food options!!!! As for me, I jumped in with both feet and got 1lb of Crawfish, 1lb of clams with corn and sausage in their 'house combination sauce', extra garlic of course, and crab Rangoons... just in case we didn't like the jelly fish. The jelly fish came and I was even nervous. Yet there was no reason to be!!!! It tastes exactly like a Poke but squishier LOL!! It was delicious! The celery added a bite and there were other veggies very nicely cut in there as well. I couldn't identify anything else besides carrots and celery. But very good! Even my hubby likes it and ate a lot of it!!!! The rangoons were good too, but the Jelly fish was the star appetizer this day. Our food came and I couldn't have been happier. If you haven't ordered the Crawfish yet. You HAVE to!!! It's amazing... garlicky, basil buttery deliciousness. The crawfish is SOO fresh and prepared so well and the clams weren't sandy nor were there many broken shells either. It was heaven. My hubby even ate the crawfish tales after I had de-shelled them haha!! We enjoyed the food very much.

I got a sandwich of pulled pork with cheese and red onions. I put an extra amount of sauce on it. GREAT! They make their own sauce. I also got a basket of three different types of meat & garlic bread points, baked beans. The beans were perfect; pieces of onion and brisket in them. All the meats - chicken, pulled pork, and brisket were perfect. Tender and juicy. The hog balls were good if you like corn meal. I don't, but having said that I think these were good with the dipping sauce. Next time I will try ribs or the thick cut pork steak. The owner said to call ahead to be sure they were available. The prices were very reasonable. 4.75 for most sandwiches, entree of three meats was 6.75. Although the place was small (2 or 3 tables) I felt I'd be welcome to sit and eat. I have tried BBQ places all over and it's nice to know I don't have to look very far anymore. I will definitely go back, and can easily recommend Woody's as a place to go for BBQ!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Went here for a show. The show was great, Avery Sunshine, and there is not a bad seat in the place. Welllll, not as far as view of the performer. What I don't like about the seating is that the distance between tables leaves very little elbow room. Also, although you are sitting at a table, seats are sold theater style and you could end up having dinner with strangers in very close proximity. It was not a problem with me this time because the people that I sat with were cool and we had good conversation. The food left a lot to be desired. The waitress was not friendly or accommodating. When I ordered my CHEESEburger she never asked me if I wanted cheese and brought me a dry burger. She didn't tell me about the drink specials, or provide any recommendations. That is darn near a necessity when it's a new place in a new city and you want people to become regulars at your restaurant\/Venue. Overall I like the place and will go back for another show.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"This is simply the very best car repair place I've ever found! They are completely professional in every way you can count. I've had two different cars in their shop and both were fixed exactly as they said they would, but most importantly to me, Mark (owner) and ALL of the other employees have treated me right. The pricing is always explained in great detail (and on one occasion even discounted on some select items since I had a very large repair being done) and I have complete confidence that their work will always be done right! Also, they have really worked hard to make the necessary car repairs for me as quickly as possible. They have worked me into their crowded repair schedule on short notice and then worked hard to be done before closing time. I live nearby the shop and Mark has stayed open after closing to complete repairs, and then also given me extra time to come by and settle the bill. You do not find this at many other car repair shops. But most importantly, when you have used cars with high mileage like I do, when you have a repair done you want to trust that your car will just work right-that your money was not wasted. You can trust Mark and his crew to make it ok. No they don't do absolutely everything on cars (I needed very heavy transmission work on a car they couldn't do but they did refer me to a great local transmission specialist) but the work they do do for you will be amazing. These guys have worked hard to earn and keep my business and I highly endorse them in every way possible!","stars":5.0}

I went in to have two root canals down one was an hour and 15 minutes . Doctor became irritated when I asked him to take breaks because of my TMJ. Went back for my crown molding fitting had a 4:15 appointment was left in waiting room until 5 due to a situation with a patient. Was brought back in and rushed because they were closing . The doctor left me in the chair with the assistant to finish my services because she had an event to attend. The assistant did a horrible job with my temp and when I went back to have it removed was given attitude for saying she didn't give me a heads up that she was going to yank it out and be painful. Was told well we don't numb for this didn't know you were going to be a whinier. When I checked out everytime I was told just wait until your services are complete to pay in full, but got hit with 5 billing statements. Needless to say what I was quoted on in the beginning and what I ended up paying was way off. Daisy the billing manager couldn't tell me why it was different just simply that I had to pay.

Abram and Dale carefully wrapped our belongings and moved quickly and efficiently. It was a sweltering day and I couldn't believe how much heavy lifting they did in such a short time. I paid an additional $125 driving charge because there was 30 miles distance between locations, but even with that extra charge the total price was still very reasonable and MUCH lower than the other quotes we got. We would recommend them without hesitation. Thank you for doing such a great job, Abram and Dale!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I only stayed here one night briefly so take my review with a grain of salt! PROS: - Personal bathrooms (shower, toilet, sink in each one and all fairly new) - Towel and sheets are included - Organized and clean - Communal kitchen and living room areas with lockers - It was only $36 a night considering I stayed during Jazz Festival week - Close to some good bars and restaurants - Security cameras and door code for everyones safety - WIFI included CONS: - It's either near a highway or a busy street because you can clearly hear cars driving by all throughout the night - Like others have stated, the area seems a little sketch. I was reassured that it wasn't dangerous but, probably like NOLA in general, I was definitely more worried about walking alone at night - Some might consider it charming but I actually thought the dim lighting in the rooms and the wooden nature of the building\/bunks were a little creepy. Might have had to do with it being located somewhere a little more isolated and me just being paranoid SUGGESTIONS: (in case someone is reading this) - Having individual lights for each bed\/bunk - Larger fans? Rooms got a bit stuffy even with the window open - Rooms that lock automatically behind you Overall they were very accommodating and organized. I checked in later and had to check out really early in the morning and they were able to help me with that. Everyone seems friendly and it was the perfect place for a short stay.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money no matter how desperate you are for a hair cut. I went in for a simple shampoo, trim and blow dry. While waiting my turn, I could not help but notice how dirty the salon was and how the two hairdressers in the store talked across the store to each other. And, they were talking negatively about other people. I almost got up and walked out then, but I was desperate for trim because my usual guy moved out of town and I had not found anyone else. When I was called up, the girl starting spraying my hair with water. I told her I wanted it shampooed and she reluctantly agreed. I thought I better mention the blow dry, even though it is the norm to wash and blow dry hair, and the service was advertised on their wall. When I mentioned that I wanted it blown dry, she said absolutely not, \"they do not do that.\" I said excuse me, and ask how was I to know if the cut was satisfactory...go home and dry it myself then come back if I had problems---she said that I could dry it myself in their store, but that they do not blow dry, she said they \"are not that kind of store.\" Really, a hair salon that advertises shampoo, cut and blow dry, doesn't want to shampoo and blow dry? Can't believe they are still in business. I called the corporate headquarters to make a complaint and they were appalled, but said it was a franchised location and could not do anything about it. She offered to take my name and give it the franchise owner, but who needs a confrontation with an owner who apparently could care less about how the store is run, the quality of the employee or the services they provide.","stars":1.0}

I was excited to try this place. I love noodles! I love Pie! Yummy togetherness at last! Only not so much.... First, let's talk about the decor. It's pretentious and overdone. I really, really hate to sound low brow here, but honestly it's embarrassing how up itself the decor in this place is. I will say that I really enjoy nice ambiance and places like La Thai uptown and The Boucherie do a nice job combining a feeling of warmth with a touch of elegance. This place just comes off as garish and up itself. Why? Ok, the silverware needs a mention here. It is so modern and weird that it is comical. I would have taken a picture to post, but my cell phone camera is awful- but trust me, it is weird, long and flat with little fork points at the end. The spoons are actually larger than a standard kitchen ladle and hard to use.The seating as someone else mentioned is uncomfortable and you get the feeling was chosen for looks rather than comfort for the diners. The menu itself is weird. I am a huge fan of starters and there was actually nothing on the 2 page long starter section that I wanted to try. We looked at it about 5 times trying to come up with something that sounded OK, but everything was just weird and there was really nothing appealing and really nothing Japanese, at least not traditional Japanese that I could see. Other than the starter menu, there are but 4 soups to choose as your main course and that's the entire menu, apart from the pie. The service- It was OK, but again a little weird. We were first told about all the drinks that they were out of, and it was a long list. Then they explained what the 2 mystery bowls of spices were on the table and I seem to remember something about chia seeds and salt....and the rest of the service was fine, but you get the feeling that they would like to scrape you off their boot as quickly as possible. The Food- Oh dear! If the rest of the situation does not make you turn and run for the door, the the food will surely keep you from coming back again! We both ordered the Ramen Soups. I ordered the Veggie and he ordered the house Ramen which had pork in a chicken broth along with various veggies and mushrooms. Mine came with Tofu, an Egg, and veggies. The soups were TINY!!! I am used to Ramen soup. I love Ramen Soup!! I was so excited that Ramen soup finally made an appearance in NOLA. But, my friends, this is not good Ramen. It really is not, I promise you.

We placed an order to go. I had the shrimp and grits and shared some pork rinds. Everything was securely packaged for the trip back to our hotel room. There was nothing shrimpy about this meal. It was a hefty block of fried grits, with plentiful shrimp, collard greens and coated in sauce. It did require true grit to try to finish everything in one go (I failed at this challenge). Overall, my meal was decent. I liked the greens and the idea of a fried grit cake is unique and was a nice balance of textures from the creamy soft interior and the crispy outer crust. I'm not sure if it was due to transport time but the shrimp was way overcooked by the time I dug into my meal though. The pork rinds were light and crispy. I enjoyed the seasoning on it.

I joined class pass and figured what the heck I would give driving there on a Sunday morning a try for the 1\/2\/3 flow class. Lucky for me it was super easy to park within a blocks distance from the studio. While I found the layout of the upstairs where the studios are a little confusing I felt like I was in a luxurious spa rather than a yoga studio. The studio itself is huge (I haven't been in the heated room yet) and the temperature is PERFECT for a non heated class. It's a little warm so I get sort of sweaty, but not humid at all with a nice breeze. The studio is also air conditioned-- which is super rare to come by in Philly so when you exit the room class is in you're hit with a wave of fresh cool air. I went back for the 1\/2\/3 flow class today with Jonathan and liked it as much as the first time I went. It moves at a slower pace than places like Dhyana- which tbh are too fast for me but even considering this you will feel the burn the whole time here. He works in inversions and arm balances too so it keeps the class exciting and appropriate for all levels. Basically it is an awesome way to start your Sunday. So glad I gave Amrita a try and I'm excited to be back soon.","stars":5.0}

Before leaving JO-ANNS, I sensed that the Curlew Ave, Dunedin Store would be a great outlet for my future business. Furthermore, there was Nancy who met me and took care of my latest selling need, which required that I secure fabric for a local church play. She fulfilled the process completely, displaying for my view, several beautiful spines of gorgeous fabrics. Nevertheless, Nancy advised me of store discounts totaling 20%. With my pleasing shopping experience, I left JO-ANNS, going onward to tell family and friends about the new found arts, crafts and materials outlet. Let's see...house decorative curtains might be a good change for the future bungalow window embellishing.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"My husband and I are constantly looking to try different happy hour deals. There are quite a few to choose from on any given day in Nashville. So after some research for where we'd try on this Saturday, we picked Sunset Grill. Under the Happy Hour section of their website, it stated clearly that there was a Happy Hour for Appetizers, Bottle Beers, Wine and Premium Cocktails EVERYDAY between 4:30-6 (I even included proof under photos on YELP). However, when we got there this afternoon and asked about the happy hour menu, the host looked at me clueless. She fumbled around at the menus and proceeds to tell me (in an annoyed tone) that there is a happy hour everyday EXCEPT Saturday. Huh?! I wanted to show her the website just to prove her wrong, but the fact that she didn't know her own specials to begin with turned me off completely. The sad things is... we probably would have stayed to eat there with or without the happy hour-- but the unwelcome reception made it really easy to turn around and walk out. I honestly cannot recall ever doing that in a restaurant. It's unfortunate this happened because the decor looked really nice, and I liked what I saw on the menu. I don't know if I'll try Sunset again, but you can't say I didn't try...","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I've sat down to eat at this restaurant on two separate occasions. The first time, I brought a friends parents on a Sat. afternoon. We sat in the bar area. We experienced a 15 min ignore followed by poor, inattentive slow service- I marked it up as the bartender having to run bar, the dining room and service bar for the back dining room. The food was decent- very small portions. Last night I was secured a table in the dining room in front of the small stage for an event, and we sat... AND SAT AND SAT AND SAT. The wait staff completely ignored us. After flagging down one guy he told us they were on wait (?) and no one could serve us. - - -SO, your telling me no one is assigned to the table we're sitting at? No one wants to take my $100 order and make my tip money? seriously?- We flag down another waitress after waiting another 30 min. and she begrudgingly takes our drink order. The drinks come 25 min later- after I asked her where they were... The rest of the night was snide looks and shit service.Our food order- very simple tacos and shrimp and grits- took an hour and twenty min. to arrive. The bearded hipster with the stupid black plastic glasses was a strait ass hole to me and threw a drink on the table in front of me. The tables all around us were displeased with the service as well. A lot of young hungry kids would be happy to have your jobs... If you can't hack Saturday night service in a not quit full dinning room, then go back to Taco Bell. Absolutely unacceptable service, regardless of the taste of the food or drinks- There are 15 other spots guests can dine within 50 feet of you establishment, with out attitude.

{"text":"Where do I begin. Initially we had to greet the front desk. After stating our last name and the size of our party he still had no clue where the rest of our party was seated. He asked us if we were part of a 13 top even though we were a party of 5. After being seated we ordered cocktails which tasted great except for the fact that we had to wait 20 minutes for them to arrive. After we received our cocktails we decided to order a pina colada which took another 20 minutes to arrive. The servers explanation was that they didn't have a blender at the bar. If she would have told us that in the first place then I wouldn't have ordered it at all. After that we never saw her until of course it was time for the bill. The food was ok and the salad bar was a joke. Maybe it's because I often visit Brazilian steakhouses in Houston that this place was such a disgrace. I originally visited this location shortly after they opened and had a bad experience then. I wanted to give them a second chance since I am aware they were still trying to work out the kinks since they just opened. This was unfortunately my second and last visit.","stars":2.0}

The lunch special is now $9.00 but you get a magnificent bowl of food. I get the shrimp and grilled pork bowl with cold vermicelli noods (had to say it). Their fish sauce dressing is a little sweeter than I'm used to so I add a little fish sauce from the table to salt it up. They've got the best chili oil too, which I apply liberally to each bite!

The only confusion we had was reserving a table: Open Table said there were none available. We called instead and were able to give our names over the phone for call ahead seating, but they were unable to give us an estimated wait time.

There's plenty of seating (unlike Green Line Cafe) and it never gets too crazy (unlike La Colombe). They've got yogurt and homemade granola, bagels and cream cheese, and homemade imitation KIND bars. Cookies and pastries as well. A drip coffee is $2.25, iced it's $3. You could spend up to $7 on a hand pour, which I've never gotten because I think that's silly.

Then had two security guards stand behind me after I said this bar was more of an LA bar than a country bar. Perhaps they were right that Broadway was no longer a country location, but I walked 10 seconds down the street and was in an old school country bar and happy. This bar is just like any other bar in any other city. Don't go here if you're looking for a country bar. It sucked. If you want an LA bar with bartenders who are obnoxious and willing to call security guards for zero reason then this is your place. Drop mic and the 20 something douchebag bartenders can promote more candy pop music for $10 a pop and make Nashville less country and more MTV.

This post is only for the customer service, the female behind the register with the locs needs customer service training. Her voice has no love and shows the business no justice, it says \"I just wanna be home, I don't care about y'all.\" When asked what an item on the menu was, she answered without an answer..... She doesn't know the menu or what's in the food..... I'm hoping the food is good because when they were at the old location , the service was FANTASTIC but my wings were not cooked fully. UPDATE: Was never given my drink, cashier states you have to ask for your drink before your food comes otherwise you won't be given it. A lady that ordered before me was never given her drink also. Took about 30min and people that ordered after me received their food before me, plus we were told we didn't wait 30min, more like 22min. We had actually waited over 30min, but that's restaurant's favorite line when they have customers wait too long. Btw I worked in a family restaurant ten years. Ro mein is good but there was really no crab meat (my chosen meat) in it, wings needed more seasoning and I didn't know it would come with corn. I don't eat corn and didn't have the option to change it. Definitely not worth $18. I'll try my luck on the next black owned business.","stars":2.0}

We decided to use the screen and it was easy to use. Next, we waited for our order for about 5 minutes or so and it was brought to where we were seated. I ordered the burger in lettuce wrap and my wife had the same burger on a potato bun. We also ordered the bacon cheese wiz fries. We also got one of their natural sodas.

{"text":"Crushed Red is a weekly staple for me! The chopped salads are made fresh to order, and filled with delicious ingredients. The flatbreads are decent, but a little sparse when it comes to toppings. Usually I stick with their amazing salads. For a truly good salad, I believe components should be well integrated for the ideal eating experience. Since the salads here are chopped up and mixed together before being served, you end up with a wonderfully cohesive meal instead of a pile of dry, unwieldy greens topped with a few pieces of everything else. Personal favorites: This Pear is on Fire and Cowpoke Smoke Salads! Both have a nice, spicy kick which keeps things interesting. If you are in the mood for a refreshing and fruity salad, I would go with the Pear. If you are feeling something more substantial, I recommend the Cowpoke. This location is in a Olive Blvd. shopping center with plenty of free parking. The lunch lines can get long though, so I would recommend coming in before or after 11:30-12:30 to avoid weekday lunch crowds.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Being from Georgia and living in Tennessee, I wasn't searching out to eat BBQ in New Orleans, but on our most recent trip, our group was staying in a house in the residential Bywater neighborhood a few blocks from this place. So we decided to check it out based on the reviews. Boy was that one of the best decisions we made on this trip! I'm normally a pulled pork BBQ eater, but I was most impressed with the brisket. It was tender and delicious! The ribs were great as well. A little of everything was ordered, so we got to sample it all. I also enjoyed the different kinds of sauces on the table. The sides were all fabulous as well. I really enjoyed the looks of this place and the atmosphere as well. We got in there for dinner just before a rush, but our group of 12 still ended up seated at different tables inside and outside because there just isn't much seating. The line and hassle finding seating is worth it. Everyone in our group raved about it and we were so stuffed when we left.","stars":4.0}

We couldn't decide between trying Acme or Felix's so to solve that we decided to try BOTH, one right after the other. All 3 of us agreed that Felix's wins hand down for their char-grilled oysters. The flavor of these oysters just can't be beat. At Acme they cover their oysters with a cheese mixture that just covers up all the taste of the oyster and makes it feel so heavy. The oysters at Felix's on the other hand are much lighter and have so much flavor packed into it. We actually ate at Felix's first and then tried Acme afterwards, but we liked Felix's so much that we went back and ordered another dozen - it was THAT good.","stars":5.0}

Very loud downstairs, but a very good vibe to the place. Loses points on cost to food ratio and bathroom line downstairs. Not a place for beef really. Sea Bass wasn't as good as I thought. Po'Boy has a lot of shrimp on it but isn't a typical one (fried shrimp with an average almost jar taste remoulade). The crabcakes are very wet\/not firm, they are not jumbo lump crab meat and for the cost it should be better - I've had cheap fish cakes that are far better and have far more texture.

{"text":"I came in June 2020 for a weekend lunch (when they serve Ethiopian) and was so impressed by the food and service here. I ordered the combination, which came with 1 meat entree and 2 choices of vegetables. I ordered the Ye'siga Tibs (saute beef), Shiro (chickpea porridge), and Bedagen (eggplant). The combo came with injera bread and a side of salad. The beef was so tender and juicy, and had the perfect amount of spice to it. I loved dipping the injera bread into the chickpea porridge, it was super creamy and not too heavy. The eggplant was cooked perfectly as well, not too mushy. I think I would've preferred if the meat and chickpea porridge were slightly less oily, but overall, the flavors of the entire combo were amazing. Service was also great; there was only 1 waitress handling the 4-5 tables occupied, but she was super courteous and friendly and kept checking back to ask how the food was.

{"text":"I have never ordered so much food in my life and enjoyed every single bite of all of it. Stokehold is essentially a single window inside of Port Orleans brewery serving high quality, unique dishes. The pumpkin salad was lovely-shaved pumpkin, apple, ch\u00e8vre, pumpkin seeds, purple onions, in a light vinaigrette. The best fall salad I've ever had. I am nearly certain this is the only place in the city that serves raclette-a half wheel of a semi soft, mild cheese heated to its gooey point of melted goodness scraped onto anything, in this case, wagyu beef. Seriously. The special of the day was recommended enthusiastically by the gentleman that eventually would bring us on a quick but informative tour of the brewery: eggs in purgatory. Eggs over a stewed mixture of tomato, peppers, and ham. Simple, with fresh ingredients. We wiped out plates clean and immediately went back up to the bar to retrieve the menu again. We had gorged, but wanted more. Next up was toasted bone marrow. The best bone marrow I've had outside of northern Italy. The toast of the marrow gave it a sort of sweetness that was addictive. Finally (and I swear it's almost over), an apple cinnamon empanada with a dollop of hand churned ice cream, (well, maybe not hand churned, but it tasted like it). They brilliantly use egg roll paper in lieu of typical empanada dough for extra crust. As if the food wasn't enough, everyone involved in this operation seems intelligent, kind, and put-together. Very proud to have this establishment in the city. I'll be back!","stars":5.0}

For funs, I pulled the tabs and we got a match - Triple 7's - whoo! According to the advertisement if you get a match, you win cash! The odds for winning $5,000 cash were 1 in 60,000 - awesome, because we got the Triple 7's which means $5,000 cash! Read the teeny-tiny print to see the disclaimers - did not see any statements like this: $ will be applied towards the purchase of a new car Purchase required to receive prize Bring in your ticket to see if you have won Everyone will receive a $5 Walmart gift card So, feeling like the movie Nebraska (synopsis: An aging, booze-addled father makes the trip from Montana to Nebraska with his estranged son in order to claim a million-dollar Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize and receives a hat) we drove to the dealer. We were greeted by Michael who saw we had our Money Carlo ticket. He asked if we were interested in buying a car, 'nope - we're just here to claim our prize'. He looked a little flustered and said 'okay, we'll let's see if you won..... are you sure you don't want to buy a car?' Nope. He walked us over to show us the board with a number that needed to be matched to win. In no place on the advertisement does it say anything about matching a number and low and behold, our number did not match. He said 'here's a $5 Walmart gift card for your time'. He quickly grabbed our winning ticket and advertisement and showed us the door. I don't want to buy a car from a dealer that engages in misleading marketing campaigns.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"My wife and I had a date night last night and walked down to Itsuki from our home. As lemonjelly points to below, Itsuki is an unlikely gem of a restaurant considering the run down, rather homely shopping center in which it lives. Replete with a laundry, gun store and baseball card shop -- stepping into the restaurant brings one into a completely different world. The decor of the restaurant is comfortable and welcoming, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The Cowboy Roll is one of our favorites there with asparagus and beef. In addition, I had the combo plate of amayashi beef and pork tankatsu which was very tasty, well proportioned and properly designed for the plate. My wife had a sizzling beef platter. Our only complaint was that the platter could have included more beef....as this is an anomaly to our usual experience here, we are overlooking this culinary faux pas. As always, a small bottle of Sho Chiku Bai cold sake rounded off the meal nicely. One of the interesting things about Itsuki is that they offer brown rice as an option for every meal. At first, I wasn't so sure this would work as good rice that never needs sauce is the hallmark of any great Japanese restaurant. Itsuki prepares is better than I've seen at vegetarian restaurants where you might expect brown rice to be perfected. It is a modern addition to japanese cuisine that I enjoy. There are several very good japanese restaurants in Santa Barbara and Itsuki is one of the better ones. If you have a family, it is also one of the most kid-friendly. My daughter loves it there and is particularly fond of the calamari appetizer.","stars":4.0}

For starters we had the Margarita Pizza. Hal's pizza is by far the best in Nashville. From the house made mozzarella to the fantastic toppings-all are superb. The Pizza man In front of the open pizza oven is smooth as silk, keeping the crust near enough to the wood fire to get just the right crispness on the crust. I watched him put out pie after pie. Mesmerizing! Hal has a deft hand with proper seasoning-flavors are clean and layered. We enjoyed the beautifully roasted chicken with pepper jelly and falls mills grits, parsnips and Brussels sprouts, and the flawlessly executed Neiman Ranch Pork Chop. Try the Bananas Foster Bread Pudding. Delicious! I like their wine list. Reasonably priced wine by the glass, good cocktail selection with generous pours. Service is always smooth, comfortable and not too overreaching. The vibe is great, hustle bustle and fun. It's possible to have a conversation with your table guest, even with all the activity of a busy restaurant. Kara, the other owner who oversees the front of the house keeps a beautiful pace with her servers. Plates arrive in a timely fashion, no long stretches between courses. LT runs like a finely oiled machine, that is cared for and the love is apparent. Well done Lockland Table!","stars":5.0}

The incident happened on a Saturday and I found My Auto Dents online when I had some down time at work Monday morning. I left a message with Eric and he got back to me extremely quickly. He was extremely personable, took a look at a few pictures of the damage on my car, and was confident he could repair it. I was hoping to make an appointment for the weekend while not at work. Eric, however, was fairly booked for the weekend, so he went out of his way to meet me at my car to work on the damage that day.

The guy at counter \"warned\" me about the Gordita being really spicy, i'm pretty terrible when it comes to handling spicy food so i was prepared to struggle with it. 1 bite, nothing, 2 bite, nothing, 3rd bite, nothing spicy was being tasted. I've been to so many other places where they tell me an item isn't spicy, yet was spicier. The Carne asada tacos tasted like they got the meat and just threw it on the grill, no seasoning, no, soaking it, nothing. The posole was about the only decent tasting thing here. I want it to be clear that i'm voicing my opinion on the food taste. The service was decent, the quality of the food was good, but the taste was lacking across the whole menu to me. Especially for the price and portion sizes. But i may be a minority in my opinion considering there was a half hour line i stood in and it only seemed to grow. Maybe its because im from SoCal so im used to more authentic stuff. All i know is that Katy Perry and Westways magazine have very lows standards on what they call \"Good Mexican food\"","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Revised post: I had been a client for years. I had finally found a tech I loved that did a great job, took pride in her work and at a clean salon. Unfortunately the front desk is not customer service oriented. They do not take phone numbers, learn their clients names, or give the courtesy of advising honestly if they are running behind or how far behind (hard to do if they don't take your number or know your name). I always saw the same person (Vivian) as she does a fabulous job. It was very common that I was asked to wait for 10-30 minutes if they were running behind. Most of the time I did not mind. However, the past few times, I was asked to come back a few hours later, waited over 45 minutes, or come back another day-- WITH A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT DAYS PRIOR. This was not the fault if anyone but the front desk, and the desk was \"too busy\" to accommodate my request to call if they were running late. I have added a star from my original post as they are clean. Their work product is good, if you can ignore the fact there is not a customer service attitude. Yes, you pay for a service, but unfortunately they don't realize you can chose to go anywhere. The front desk only hurts their employees by treating loyal customers who tip well this by acting like we are optional.

{"text":"I would give this place 3 stars if it weren't for their completely amazing chips and salsa. I wish this place was like Fazoli's and I could just sit and eat these for a minimal price all night. I would probably go here every day and gain dozens of pounds from these things. They are simply the best chips I have ever had at a restaurant. DELICIOUS. Aside from the chips and salsa, the menu is fairly standard. Back in my meat eating days, I loved the fish tacos at this place. Unlike most of the restaurants in St. Louis, they truly know how to make a fish taco and don't deep fry the fish to a point so greasy it's hardly identifiable as healthy. Know, I stick with the veggie options, and like most Mexican restaurants, this is an easy place to find many good ones. Burritos, fajitas, and other veggie assorted goodness dominate my veggie choices here. I don't usually hang out in Frontenac, but if I am catching a movie I like to hit this place up for dinner first. It always makes for a nice evening, and surprisingly enough, the prices here don't break the bank the way you would expect a good Frontenac establishment to. Oh, and they have a really cute patio out front with huge tiki torches and comfortable tables. On a nice night, it's a great place to enjoy a meal with friends.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"So, first off: this place is a bar with light, ala carte cuisine. And its not all that great, either. We visited this place on a Tuesday afternoon. There was a fair amount of people there, but, almost half of the patrons were employees. Including several people taking shots while on the clock and serving customers...wha-? We're talking 3:30 in the afternoon. Our server had a passive-aggressive 'tude and was far too distracted with getting ready to end her shift and watching her kid who was hanging out on the patio. The GOOD: Excellent, I mean REALLY excellent margaritas. The salsa was pretty good also. The BAD: everything else. Now, having lived in Southern California for 17 years, I know good, authentic Mexican food. Even still, I try not to be a total snob about Midwest Mexican cuisine attempts...but, this place claims to be true blue authentic, so they open themselves up to scrutiny. First off, the queso was curdled. Gross!! Second, chips and salsa is served with plates?? Really? How do you dip a chip on a plate? I suppose you're supposed to just squirt some salsa on a chip, which is OK, but not everyone wants to do that. $4 tacos served on a 3\" corn tortilla. Yes, $4 for ONE tiny taco...and, nothing else. The fish taco was mediocre, at best. The papas tostada was also just okay. The papas were of the sweet variety and that wasn't mentioned on the menu. Not cool. Not everyone likes sweet potatoes. Overall, no reason to return here unless I'm dying for a stiff margarita.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Our first time here. Locals have been telling me for a long time that this is their preferred eatery in Ozona. We were not as impressed. 1st: I asked about the oyster appetizer & was told by our waiter that a dozen cost $14.99 & that I could order them raw, steamed, fried, i.e. any which way I wished. They ended up being $16.95 & tiny, tiny, tiny. They were tasty with their drawn butter, but just marginally fried & hot. 2nd: our She Crab Soup was not anywhere close to being the \"excellent\" characterization our waiter tagged it to be. I even told him that \"the best part of the soup were the accompanying saltines\". It was too thick, pasty, chalky-tasting w\/ undercooked celery bits. The Blackened Mahi Tacos with Black Beans n' Yellow Rice were spot-on w\/ large chunk's of fish. Warning: they're excellent but REALLY MESSY to eat. My two rounds of BOGO Jim Bean Bourbons & Sprite were decent & undiluted for $12.50, but my wife's one Cupcake Chardonnay was priced at a happy hour non-inclusive $8.75, gotcha.

{"text":"KO is one of the only places in Newtown that offers decent Asian food. I thought the restaurant was mainly Korean; however, the extensive menu showed a variety of Japanese and Thai food. Since it was our first time here, we asked our waitress what she thought was enjoyable and some popular dishes, her response, \"Everything is good!\" Not helpful in any shape or form. We went with the Edamame Dumplings, Korean Fried Tofu&Kimchee Ramen and Chicken Pad Thai. The Edamame Dumpling were everything I hoped them to be: soft, delicious and packed with flavor. The only thing missing from these small bites of enjoyment was a kick (chili and soy sauce fixed that). The broth of the Ramen was also packed with flavor but again missing that kick that I wanted. I most likely wouldn't get the tofu again, it was extremely bland. The Pad Thai tasted a bit generic, as in- personally, Pad Thai tastes the same everywhere, it's hard to mess up. Just like the Ramen and Dumplings, it was pretty low on the spice level. We did tell our waitress to make our main courses spicy but I guess their spicy and my spicy is a bit different. When I visit again (and I will) I probably won't order any of the things that I ordered except the dumplings. Also- their happy hour menu looks amazing and it's offered on Saturdays so I'll definitely be trying that as well. I'm giving this place 4 stars since the waitress was a tad unhelpful and inattentive but the food is definitely worth another trip back.","stars":4.0}

Cocktails were well received by our group, including one where they mix coconut with whipped cream and re-pressurize it to be added to a shaved ice drink. Ambiance was perfect.

A superlative visit to one of the best botanical gardens I've ever been to was capped by lunch, outside on the deck, under the trees at a spacious umbrella table. It was truly a fine dining experience in every sense from the well spaced, capacious tables to the impeccable yet friendly service, to the food itself. Everything was organic and locally sourced and there was a lot to choose from on a rather ambitious menu. Some of the veggies were grown on the estate itself ( like the heirloom tomatoes in the special gazpacho that I started with) . The rolls came in funny little pots which it seems is a tradition at Longwood, and they were wonderful too. My main course was a grilled organic chicken that was \"beyond belief\" succulent, and came nestled in a bed of garlicky, herbed grits-- yes, I said grits. They are definitely not just for breakfast anymore. We are talking \" melt in your mouth \" wonderful. After tromping around the spectacular gardens and taking pictures all morning, it was a real treat to be pampered under the treetops with a leisurely lunch at 1906. This was my first, but I hope not my last visit.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Having lived in Philly for a number of years, it's always exciting when a new, relatively unadvertised bar with great initial reviews pops up on the map. When a close friend mentioned Writer's Block, I was eager to see what the new digs were all about. Situated on a quaint, quiet street in Washington Square West my friends and I were eager to meet for happy hour (6-8) and catch up over a few cocktails. Upon entering the bar, the vibes were lively and welcoming. The layout of the bar is unique in that it has three separate bar areas on three different floors, including a lounge area on the second floor. One person in our party had arrived early to attempt to secure a table (for 6) on the second floor lounge area. Upon ascending the stairs, I found myself attempting to soak in the ambiance and peek around the corner of the lounge area (we were blocked off by rope barrier) when I was told by the hostess that it was crowded, and there was no need to look as she should be trusted. We then attempted to walk through the lounge area to observe the third floor bar as a separate individual told us it had some space, when the hostess again scolded us to please stand behind the rope barrier. After mentioning several times that it was our first time at the bar and we had repeatedly heard GOOD THINGS, the hostess mentioned that our party of 6 was way too big to fit within the confines of the space - without attempting to make any accommodations. Within in a matter of 10 minutes we left the bar, having experienced atypical rudeness that you won't usually find with other bars nearby in the area. As one other review mentions \"I *almost* don't want anyone to know about this place...\" Whether the hostess took that mantra to heart or not, our party left with the inclination that first impressions are everything, and our impression left us no real desire to step through the doors of Writer's Block again anytime soon.","stars":2.0}

That's right, Lula makes their very own vodka, gin and rum. Each bottle only costs you about $20.00. I went for lunch and was given the option to dine inside their rustic yet modern dining room or outside on the outside patio. I chose outdoor for once. It was pretty warm out, and I ordered the \"Cucumber Vodka Collins\", per my server, Magaly's suggestion. It was made with house made vodka, cucumber, lemon, cane sugar and splash of soda. Very refreshing! This was a great recommendation. My date ordered the \"Bees Knees\" and it was also pretty good. For starters, I ordered the \"Crawfish Queso,\" creamy crawfish cheese dip, smoked poblanos, accompanied with the fried wonton chips. I loved the dip, the flavors were rich with a little spice. The chips were perfect. They were airy, yet crunchy, and had the perfect amount of salt. For the main course, we shared the \"Hot Garlic Shrimp\" and the \"Lamb Chops\". Both were a hit. The shrimp honestly was not hot or spicy, but it had tons of flavor and was tossed in a herb base and crushed garlic that was absolutely divine. The sauce also covered over the fries, making them just as good. The lamb chops were a hit. The order came with five Chimichurri lamb chops. Chimichurri is an Argentinean sauce, typically made with oregano, garlic, olive oil, maybe red pepper flakes, and parsley. They were absolutely amazing and for sure brought the flavors. Our sides were roasted potatoes, bacon, green beans and perfectly cooked onion rings! I must say I was impressed. I truly enjoyed this experience.","stars":4.0}

Free WiFi is a plus as well. I can't give it five stars because the hotel is SO huge. Our room was kind of tucked away and not super accessible. It was, however, extremely quiet in our wing. It's connected to a kind of depressing empty mall which was easy to ignore but kind of sad to look at. The services and stores in the mall need vast improvement. Also, prices are really expensive but expected for a downtown hotel that likely caters to convention traffic. Parking is $24 on top of your room fee though they do have free valet which is nice. While our breakfast was good, a pot of coffee cost $8 and pancakes cost $12. We did get room service ($4 delivery fee and 22% gratuity makes it cheaper to order pizza) and everything was arranged beautifully on a tray with a fresh flower. Overall, I expected the bloated tourist prices and was really satisfied with our stay.","stars":4.0}

Two seconds later a rude teenager responded with \"we are closed\", I proceeded to leave. Tonight myself and my girlfriend decided to take another chance at this location. There was about 8 cars total there and it took about 11 minutes to get our food. When we arrived back home I opened my sonic burger and let me tell you, DISSATISFACTION at its finest. The burger was literally thrown together and to top it off the burger was on two bottom buns, both of which were soggy as all get out. I will NEVER go back to this location and will use the ole trusty 96 one. You might as well have not even put a sonic in berry farms because at this rate it won't last long.

{"text":"Sunday, December 26th was my first time visiting Buca. Hopefully it's not my last! I will kick this off by saying that my party took the term \"family style dining\" and really ran with it. We had 28 people in our party. A whole back room was reserved for us. Overheard a couple of servers talk about how they didn't expect such a crowd size, but I can relate to the pure horror of large parties and working in the food industry (once upon a time). Still, our service was prompt and friendly. Shoutout to Mo for being a rockstar. You won't find employees like her too many places. She was friendly and attentive. Recommend for her service alone. The chicken parm was tasty. The chicken was well-cooked, crispy; the sauce was flavorful. The salads looked great! Didn't try any but my family raved about them. The chicken Alfredo wasn't the best. I have yet to find any restaurants that can contend with Olive Garden's Alfredo sauce. I had to add a bit of Parmesan cheese to the top of my Alfredo to get much flavor. It wasn't awful -- I'd eat it again -- but not as a first choice. The cheesy bread was crispy, flavorful, filling, yet still perfectly portioned. The mozzarella bites were also pretty good. Nothing to rave about but if you have little ones, they'll probably like them. (And if they're not a fan of cheese, consider adoption? I dunno, that's your call.) Highlights of the visit: Big party + fast, friendly service = great review! Clean environment. (Obviously kinda important these days.) Overall, food was 4\/5 stars. Definitely worth it for the price. Downsides: A bit of a stretch but some of the items lacked the flavor I was hoping for. Hoping to stop in again soon!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Great food but the place needs to get its act together. On 9\/10\/17 at 5pm I went to Piada. No one else was in line. Not busy. I assumed I'd get my food soon. By 5:30pm I had to ask for a refund. I ordered the balsamic salad with crispy chicken. I was there with a friend who had a similar order with the same chicken. He got his food quickly. Me on the other hand--not so much. After letting me wait 10 min (I was standing with my friend--visibly waiting--the cashier realizes I don't have my salad). He hands it to me without the chicken. He realizes I still needed chicken and gave it back to the guy who prepared it. He waits a bit and then gets the cook's attention to let him know I still need my chicken. He tells the employee just to put the grilled chicken on it. I'm clearly not happy at this point and tell him it's not what I ordered. Then a guy in a chef's hat comes out from the back and I tell him the problem. At which point the guy who was supposed to make my chicken yells that it's the same chicken. Well then why make me wait so long? The guy in the chef hat then tells me it's not the same. Surprised the chef\/manager let it get to this point, I ask for a refund. I was very surprised at the service and that he was willing to let a customer leave upset. I'm not a local but visit often and usually go to Piada 1-2x a month. Not any longer. Update: I've been back since and the experience was much better.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"We knew what we were in for when we pulled into the Waffle House, but against our better judgment we actually walked in, sat down, and ordered. From the outset, it actually looked positive - the place was bustling, people were seated and eating, and there were at least 8 staff working away. As soon as we ordered, it seemed like the whole place shut down and we entered the Twilight Zone. All of the staff went on break, none of the tables were cleaned, the food took 20mins to arrive, and the Minute Maid orange juice that I was most looking forward to never showed up. When we asked about it, we were told that none had been made in a while and that what they had wasn't good. Umm, orange juice? The place is messy, the staff take breaks to eat instead of clean up and everything is so inefficient, I was visibly nervous watching how things operated. The guy is pulling the waffles off of the waffle iron with his bare hands. I'm sure that founders Joe Rogers and Tom Forkner are rolling in their graves right now. I wanted to jump over the counter and help these incompetent bunch, it was really hard to sit & watch. The food finally arrived and the waffle was good...luke warm, but good...or was I just that hungry? The over-easy eggs were runny, nothing easier than a couple of eggs, but that was messed up too. I literally slurped them down and I think I may give birth to 2 baby chickens soon. Then it was time to get the bill, took the guy like 10 minutes to write it up with his calculator. What is this 1960? There are automated machines that do this for you now. I guess it was easier this way, there were so many things that needed to be removed from the bill anyways. The whole experience felt like we were on some funny TV show, where the hosts would jump out and scare us or laugh at us for what we had just experienced. I think Jim Gaffigan said it best when he tagged it \"Awful House.\" Never again I do declare, never again!","stars":1.0}

With closer examination today we found damage to the decor piece and it was stickered with a red tag for $0.00 Once we got to register cashier admits she tagged this and should not be on the floor. she Immediately radio's the manager. The manager says it couldn't be sold on the floor because it could hurt somebody. Then she proceeded to say she needed \"something\" (paid) for it and looked at the original cost. She offered to sell it at $25, went down to $20, $19.99 when we tried to negotiate $10. Manager would not budge. Now the item will probably sit in the dump. We were already purchasing another item that we may have well overpaid for. There's no admission of guilt from the staff even though they clearly were at fault. Due to their staff's brashness and terrible communication on their end I give this location a 0-star.","stars":1.0}

There was never an empty glass or shortage of bread and butter! The menu included all the Italian classics. Our party ordered spaghetti and meatballs, the appetizer plate, ravioli, fettucini Alfredo, and chicken parmigiana. I ordered the manicotti and it was the best I've ever had!

{"text":"\"I don't think he [the chef] knows how good this food is. I don't think anyone could know how good this food really is,\" said my friend as she was eating. She texted another friend a picture of the mixed grill \"for two\" and that other friend sent back a picture of steak he grilled. As if there was a contest! We had a humongous platter of food; I think there were at least 15 pieces of meat - three chicken breasts, two steaks, eight sausages, and two hamburger patties. But I couldn't really count. All I remember is that almost all the other patrons and us were there for a couple hours. I mean, it takes a long time to digest all that food! I am not a huge meat lover, but I love grilled chicken and it was some of the best chicken. I do not like sausage and loved these. I do not like steak that much and loved these. Get my gist? My friend just returned from a trip to a third-world country where she got large plates of meat for under $3. She loves meat dishes and has wanted to try Chef Alisah's. As we walked in, I was taken back to when I visited Eastern Europe just because of the people there. What is Bosnian food like? I am not sure if it reminded me of Greek food except for the cucumber yogurt dip. To me, it is like a combination of Argentine\/Brazilian churrascaria and my Persian\/Iranian friend's amazing Mom's kabab and salad cooking. The portions are humongous and the chef seems to practically redefine hamburger, sausage, and steak. Everything was grilled consistently throughout which is impressive in itself. Yes, there were a lot of side dishes. Yes, the meal for two was at least enough to feed three hungry carnivores for $26 or something like that. Yes, it was hilarious to see other diners' reactions to the amount of food. Yes, it was awesome how everyone was drinking that orange soda in a bottle because 'everyone else was' (why are we - me included - so fascinated by glass bottle drinks?). Chef Alisah, I really don't think you know how good your food is. You possibly couldn't; it's beyond description.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"WOW. We ate here this past week and found it to be over-priced junk food. For a supposed \"chef\" to toot his own horn time and time again is pathetic. Lou Aaron is fairly self-serving and cared nothing for our concerns as my son had a piece of plastic in his sandwich. When we asked to speak to Lou Aaron the owner, he showed up in about 30 minutes and claimed that \"we\" were simply disgruntled customers and proceeded to bash my wife for who knows why. While we lived in Boise, we ate at the State Street location ONCE and we now are reminded as to why we never returned. Keeping this in mind, we also noted a lack of care and concern from the staff and a lack of the ability to problem solve as management and direction seemed to be absent. We noted while we were waiting to speak to \"Chef\" Lou Aaron that other customers had complaints from food temps to time spent waiting for their orders and they also ran out of ice and failed to address this issue. Yet most notably, while we were here, we noticed two parties in the kitchen were taken away in hand cuffs by \"Parole Agents\"..............and bingo was his name O. My advice to the \"fast food\" Dive-in and owner \"Chef\" Lou Aaron, your food is lousy and your demeanor problematic. If your trying to act life a \"five star\" establishment, then I suggest you get out of the \"fast food\" business, attend culinary school and learn what a quality product is BEFORE you make the claim your such a good cook. Cause not only was there plastic in my sons food, the prime rib sandwich was over rated, had little flavor and is overpriced.

In fact, the construction hasn't slowed growth in Midtown at all. New businesses are opening monthly, and there are even more on the horizon, all looking forward to a bright future with you. Take Amari for example. They opened this July, on Cheney Street next to Death & Taxes, to the hustle of an active construction site right outside. They're not bitter about the construction though. They just love the bitter flavors of classic aperitifs and digestifs, like amaro and fernet, and created a space to celebrate them all. Just a few minutes here and you'll feel as though you've been whisked away to a quiet Italian neighborhood bar perfect for casual conversation or that special first date. Further south, Martin Street was undergoing a similar transformation. That didn't deter Reno local and famed hairstylist to the stars, Tyler Colton, from choosing it as the home for The Emerson, a beautiful mid-century modern lounge in the heart of Midtown which opened in July. While the vibe is classic and casual, the cocktail program is anything but, thanks to award-winning mixologist, Anna Maye Vetter. Vetter is known for her whimsical and creative approach to cocktail design, particularly with regard to clever flavor combinations and presentation, and you can experience it all here. There's no doubt that the photos of her cocktails and the beautiful space shared on Yelp and social media, along with a concise food menu and unique programming like drag bingo and classic movie night, have helped many of us to forget about the construction in favor of new experiences. Remember, Reno started as dusty dirt roads. Embrace our pioneer spirit and make your way to Midtown, where, regardless of construction, it's business as usual.","stars":5.0}

After my wash, Mary came over with a smile and asked what I wanted. I told her that I was a recent graduate and just wanted a more professional haircut for interviews, etc.. She suggested a slightly angled bob, and I agreed. Let me say that she did an amazing job! The angle was subtle; it looked cute, while still keeping a professional shape. Mary was very professional and visibly takes her job very seriously. I was very impressed as I have very thick, straight asian hair! I asked her to thin it a little bit because it can sometimes get out of control. She really did a nice job. She also turned me onto Morrocan oil. It is pricey, but really keeps your hair tame.

It's also probably one of the few airports that has a Yelp check-in offer. Although, I don't think you need to check-in for a free luggage tag. I give them props for their tech-savvyness. They have a separate area for ride share\/Uber pickup. This is nice but they need to free up a bit more space for it. It bottlenecked the Uber's and created a bit of a crowd. Nothing that lasted too long but could fixed by giving them some more space in the lot. Security was fine for me. Moved quickly but I could see it getting backed up. They didn't have a lot of room dedicated for it. But then again, most airports in the US weren't build for long security lines. The amenities are nice. From plenty of food options, to updated bathrooms and comfy seating options with charging stations it has everything you need in a modern airport. They have a handful of NOLA inspired food options.

{"text":"I live right around the corner from ARM Enterprises and have had two experiences now that will lead me to recommend these gentlemen to anyone looking for auto repair\/maintenance in the Philadelphia area. This summer a friend of mine experienced a driver's side window that would not close due to electronic failure. While most would only perform this type of work if tasked with replacing the entire mechanism, these guys were compassionate of my friend's limited financial means (we are college students) and her desire to simply have the window closed. Without hesitation, they obliged and told us they'd be in touch in just a few hours. This type of customer service was exceptional, and as promised they had my friend's window up in a short amount of time for an extremely reasonable rate. This was my first experience with ARM Enterprises. Fast forward to just a few days ago, and I came in contact once again with the gentlemen from ARM; albeit in an odd and unfortunate situation. As previously mentioned I live just around the corner from the shop, and as I headed North on Ridge Avenue coming from my home I was involved in a high impact, head on collision with another motorist at the intersection of Ridge and 13th Streets just past ARM. The guys from the shop heard the collision, rushed out to ensure both drivers were ok (luckily and amazingly we both walked away without a scratch), and immediately offered without second thought to help us get our vehicles off of Ridge Avenue and pulled into their lot a half block away as we dealt with the aftermath at a fairly late hour. They proceeded to use their own truck to pull both of our totaled vehicles into their lot for storage overnight, and stayed at the shop until the police came to file a report and we had exchanged information. In total, the gentlemen from ARM spent approximately an hour's time helping out two of their \"neighbors\" (the other driver lived close by as well) who had just been involved in an accident without requesting a dime in return. They stored our vehicles overnight and cooperated as we worked to have the damage inspected and the cars towed away the next day, even though it was evident they had plenty of their own business to attend to that day. In sum, the generosity, compassion, and selflessness of the gentlemen at ARM Enterprises struck me that night and was immensely appreciated in the face of a frustrating situation and a true time of need. Thanks so much to all from ARM involved in helping out, and most importantly, thanks for restoring my faith in the decency of people. When I get some new wheels, I know exactly where I'll be headed for emission inspections\/oil & lubes and my friends in the city will hear the same. My sincerest thanks, once again. Your Neighbor, Zach","stars":5.0}

We checked in at 6:30 and we moved towards the bar because there was absolutely no room to stand and wait by the entrance and the weather was cold. We did not order drinks at the bar and just stood there waiting for our table. Yet, somehow the host was confused and thought that we did not want to eat anymore and just wanted to stand at the bar and not order anything. He claimed to have called our party's name, but we didn't come over so he just ASSUMED we did not want a table anymore. Meanwhile we see people being seated that had arrived way after we have arrived. The host claims to have called out our party's name, yet the volume in the place makes it impossible to hear someone from all the way across the restaurant call your name! I attempted to ask the host where our place in line was and he made me wait while he seated other people. He was very disrespectful when I was simply asking what our situation was and stated, \"Well if you guys were over here I would've called you, but no one was here so I assumed you changed your mind.\" He then eventually sat us while serving a bunch of other tables and by this time we had waited an HOUR. Then, we sat at our table just waiting forever for water! After ten minutes of just sitting, I had to ask the waiter, who's also the manager, that walked by who our server was and if we could get water. He replied, \"I am and if you give me a minute I'll come back.\" So 5-10 minutes goes by and he finally comes back with water. While he was filling our waters we told him we were ready to order and he just replies, \"That's great\" and proceeds to walk away from our table and go fill peoples waters at other tables. At this point we have had ENOUGH and left the restaurant. We felt we were very poorly treated and they never once apologized for the wait or asked how we were doing. We understood that we went during a busier time, but they should not have taken their frustration out from being busy on their CUSTOMERS. With this being said, we will never return to this establishment and advise all other potential customers of this rude service. We then proceeded to go to Mission Taco and were seated immediately with the BEST costumer service. By the time we left Mission Taco we would not have even received our food yet from Luchas.

It's way cheaper than paying 1.85 or whatever per topping on a small. But if you have specific wants, your wallet is SOL, because it is better and healthier than other local options (Powelton, Ed's, Ted's), but just not worth it. I also bought hummus here last time I want and they basically covered the inside of the bowl with as little hummus as they could, and I guess called it art. Bar not open in the day, only beer. They do have oktoberfest. My waiter was SUPER inattentive.

{"text":"I've been here now four times for Sunday brunch and I've always left happy. I've read a few other reviews and have to say that my experience with the service, atmosphere and food has always been great. The last time I visited, July 27, 2014, the server was very attentive, coming by to re-fill my coffee several times. The coffee was excellent and I actually wish that I hadn't received three re-fills as I was buzzing by the time we left. I was visiting with a friend that I hadn't seen in a while and the server never once pressured us to hurry up. The food has always been great! I've tried both the house salad and potato sides. The salad has so many complimentary ingredients like chickpeas, nuts, dried fruit, carrots, etc. It is one of those salads you wouldn't bother making at home with all the ingredients you would have to buy, so I highly recommend it. This last time I had their breakfast special which as a bacon and onion quiche. This was a very unique quiche as it reminded me more of a strudel with a very flaky crust that was folded all around the eggs, bacon, onion and cheese. I would recommend making reservations for most Sundays. I have had to wait for over 20 minutes for a table which didn't bother me since I knew that they accept reservations and I had not made one. I was just happy they could squeeze us in.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Made a reservation for late dinner Saturday after valentine's day.. Sat us down pretty fast. Place is nice, deemed lights, a little tight but perfect for me. Husband and I ordered the cheese platter as appetizer and it was ok. Was not a fan of the mortadella (my only fav thing from the plate was the prosciutto), for entree we ordered Parillada for 2 which is a mixture of skirt steak, angus short rib, Spanish sausage, mollejas and blood sausage and it came with 2 sides so we order rice and mashed potatoes. Not sure what the mollejas was, the waiter did say it but I wasn't paying attention. My favorite was the skirt steak, it was very flavorful and then the Spanish sausage. Was not a fan of the angus short rib it was missing flavor. And the blood sausage was not my thing. I had it as a little girl so as an adult I no longer eat it. My husband wanted to try it which he ended up feeling disgusted by it as soon as he try to cut it with a butter knife\u200d. The blood sausage spit out of the wrap and he refused to it because of how it looked . I warned him but he didn't listen. . So we did not try the blood sausage. My favorite side was the rice. The mashed potatoes were ok. For dessert we ordered the bread pudding with dulce de leche cream and that was delicious. (I am a fan of desserts \u200d). Our waiter Juan was excellent in explaining the menu and taking care of us the whole night. All the staffs we encounter were very nice. The co-owner came to our table and make sure we were good.

{"text":"This is my favorite grocery store. They have an amazing selection of foods. A lot of people I know, think this place is more expensive than other places, but it's really not. Sure, you can spend over $100 on a small dry aged steak, but the everyday staples I need are cheaper than other places. My wife and I love the Newman's Own lemonade and most stores carry two varieties at most. Wegman's has five or six... And it's cheaper... I'm not a huge fan of the layout of a lot of items, but I understand what they are trying to accomplish. They want like foods, near themselves. I would love to go and just look at all of their flour in one spot, but it's strategically placed around the store. Some really small obscure items, like spices, are not replenished in a timely manner. I don't really enjoy talking to strangers and these employees don't talk to me ever. It should be a great thing, to someone as anti-social as I am, but it just feels a little cold. I've also had a few employees who were flat out rude to me. If this store wasn't as amazing as it was, I would probably never return. But oh... It's just so perfect when it comes to food... I'm pretty sure their employees could key my car and physically assault me and I'd still come back a few days later. I first started going to Wegman's for their amazing beer selection. It's among the best in the area, but mainly because not too many places could sell six packs at the time. The buffet bar has a huge selection, but it has been lacking in quality in the past year or so... Foods don't taste as fresh and some favorite items have been pulled from the menu. Or it's still there, but just whenever I'm not... I still enjoy getting food there, but since I'm not as impressed with the buffet, I've now tried the pizza and sandwiches. The pizza was alright, but I like a thicker crust. The sandwiches are just so perfect though. If I want food and notice no line at the sandwich section, I'm going right there to get one.","stars":4.0}

Well trash on the floor when going in was the 1st issue, Sat 10 minutes before a server came over, Thank gosh there was a busser who brought coffee. The server was short with us and quite snippy. The food was ok but luke warm at best looked as if it sat for a while. After finshing and only being helped with refills by the busser, I went up front to get me check. The cashier had to find Ana the server and our bill wasn't even ready so we had to wait for that and I asked a question on the bill because it was written in abbreviations. again a snippy attitude came out. remarked it looks like your busser is the only one going to get a tip and she said oh well. I paid my bill and asked if there is a manager on duty, because I am a restaurant GM for a 7 million dollar a year restaurant. The cashier said she was the manager. My thought was maybe she should not being serving or managing because she doesnt know or understand customer service. I may return to the Sparks location but I hope the Reno location closes down if that is how they want to run things. Ana The so called Manager\/Server is a train wreck.

One thing I love about this platter of oysters is the butter sauce. The blend of spices and garlic is just sublime. I could eat these things all day. Boo Fries: Also known as the Poutine of the south. The ones served here is pretty good, but I'm a Detroiter,, my close proximity to Canada has turned me into a poutine snoot. Not really up to par. New Orleans Medley: Gumbo was good, red beans and rice was strong AF, Jambalaya is winning and the sausage was ok. Shrimp Po Boi: Bread was fresh, crusty and chewy, the shrimp was nicely seasoned and the fixins was on point. Except I swear I ordered fish instead became shrimp. Over all a pretty good place to eat.

Having grown up in Fort Washington, I suddenly realized that my family never ate breakfast out, and I had no idea where to go to find a good diner. Rides through Andorra, Flourtown, Fort Washington disappointed, but with the old (now closed) diner near springhouse on the radar, Rich's Other Place suddenly pinged the memory banks and sure enough, it was still open, and serving breakfast. Jackpot! A short wait gave rise to a table, good service, and good food. None of the spectors of previous reviews showed themselves, and we had a really nice breakfast of a western omelet and, for the wife, a breakfast combo of eggs and French toast. All was warm, reasonably priced, and yes, tasty. Service was good and kept the coffee cup (and yes, water glass) filled! Bonus was meeting and chatting with Rich, owner of Rich's deli, who I hadn't seen since we moved away in '92. I can't recall how many miles I put on my bike as a kid, riding to Rich's to pick up hoagies for my family. If the Philly half-marathon- or marathon, fingers crossed- are in my future for November 2015, Rich's Other Place is now on the radar for a solid meal to reload after the run!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I was really disappointed with a recent visit to Parc. I understand it is a pandemic, but I feel businesses should be grateful for people who are willing to spend money and give them the service they deserve. For a lunch that costs well over a few hundred, I honestly would have received better service at a diner. We visited during a very cold day and we were happy to sit outside. You need reservations for the outdoor pods but each uncovered table has a heater and you can sit there without one. I took my niece here as a Christmas present after hearing such great things about it. The hostess and that portion of the visit was pleasant and inviting. Once we sat down, we sat and watched tables around us get attentive service, while we just sat. A table that was sat well over 5 minutes after us received service before us. I feel for our restaurants right now so I just stayed patient. Servers walked by us and saw we were sitting. Our food came before the drinks. When the food came out, my lunch was missing but no one ever came back to touch the table to check in, so I sat while my family ate. Our waters sat empty for a the entire meal. I was never asked if I wanted another drink. By the time the server surfaced, my family was done so I asked the server to just take it off the check and the response was: that's my fault I forgot to put it in. No offer to make it up or actually even just bring it and discount it(it was only soup). The food we did receive was good, which was the reason for any stars. We had the crab and avocado, macaroni and cheese, soups, and hot drinks. I understand the outside seating is a challenge but when people come to a restaurant and want to tip 20% to support the service industry, and when people are really watching their spending, the servers should not take it for granted. Of course I still tipped 20 percent, but I feel like saying the service is bad because we are in a pandemic is not acceptable. Absolutely not worth the money. This was my first and my last visit.","stars":2.0}

In Los Angeles alone, there are so many options for Italian pizza it's not even funny, with a particularly excellent place not 5 minutes from my home. All that being said to frame my opinion: this is truly spectacular pizza! I couldn't believe how perfectly-cooked my Pizza Margherita was. I bucked authenticity for protein and got prosciutto added on it, and it was flavorful without being salty. I asked our server for crushed red pepper and was told I had the option of spicy oil. Spicy oil! I missed that so much!! I used to drizzle that on my pizzas in Europe and had forgotten about it! It was sooo good! And with a great pilsner on draft, I was in heaven. For dessert, I had to get the chocolate melting cake. It was over-the-top awesome and gooey chocolatey awesomeness poured forth once cut open. It was glorious.

{"text":"My husband and I backpack in national forests quite frequently, and our goal is always to leave them cleaner than we found them. Most recently, we went on a car camping trip with friends. These are the same friends we car camped with near Mommoth, Sequoias, and most recently the Los Padres National Forest. We were quite disappointed by the amount of trash we saw everywhere on this trip. The very first night it was just my husband and I and we camped in the lower Los Padres. Just as we were setting up our tent, we look down to see a pile of human feces. Upon looking around, we saw other areas of used toilet paper. We figured it was because it was so close to the road. However, the next day we met up with our friends and camped closer to the Big Sur area, still in the Los Padres N.F. Again, it was impossible to find a camp area out of sight of open piles of feces and mounds of used toilet paper. Very disappointing. Also, gas on U.S. 1 sold for $6.50 gallon and ice was $4 a bag. So be prepared. I'm not blaming the forest rangers, but we certainly saw plenty of them. They seemed to be oblivious to the sanitation problem, unfortunately.","stars":2.0}

The ambiance is that of a lovely wine bar- supple leather chairs and heavy drapes- dark and cool. Here's what I think is most important about this place- it is special and Churchill-esque (see pleasure pig) but not so sophisticated and snobbish as to be off-putting. I like wine- I know how to order for my palatte. My friend would drink sutter home and call it good- but could still find a drink he was comfortable with (they have a full bar) and even tried a glass of the wine I got- which he loved.

I'm pleased to say my cranky attitude was completely wrong and it was totally worth the drive and cost of admission (although, being fully honest, my boyfriend bought the tickets ). It was a stunning display of lights that felt truly magical to walk through, definitely a super romantic way to spend our evening. They also had fire pits, s'mores kits for purchase, and we were able to tour the Cheekwood estate, which in and of itself was wildly impressive. I especially enjoyed the art museum on the top floor of the estate which featured a ton of incredible artwork.

{"text":"Zero stars would be too generous. I was on the receiving end of a vehicle delivery that had been contracted by Alpha Motor Sports. The driver called at 10:00 pm on New Year's Eve and demanded that I take delivery within 30 min even though the car was not scheduled to arrive until the following day. 40 minutes later the driver calls as said that he had arrived. There wasn't a carrier in front of my home so I inquired as to where he was. He was more than a third of a mile away parked on a dark street. I requested that he deliver the vehicle to my residence as contracted. He indicated that I could either come pick it up or he would drop it at an impound yard. When I arrived at the carrier the car was being unloaded. The driver insisted that I sign the paperwork noting that the vehicle had been delivered in good condition prior to inspection. He was visibly nervous when I refused to do so and began pacing when I pulled out a flashlight and began filming the condition. Like so many other reviewers have shared, this company has a knack for damaging vehicles. The hood had deep scratches and 2 sizable dings, the passenger wheel well had been dented and there was another deep scratch running from the rear quarter panel to the rear bumper. I videoed the damaged at the time of delivery and noted the damage on the receipt paperwork. The driver had not noted any damage at the time of pick up. On top of the $2,200 in damages the car had more than 150 miles added to the odometer between pick up and drop off. The driver was clearly using my car for personal use. Paper Impex Claims department initially suggested that the driver insisted the vehicle had been on the upper deck for the duration of the journey and that the damages reported could not have occurred while the vehicle was in his custody. Alpha MotorSports promptly sent them a video of my car being loaded onto the lower deck along with a high definition video of the cars condition that was filmed before release to Alpha MotorSports. Realizing that the photographic evidence did not align with with driver's story, the claims department asked me to get an estimate from a shop of my choosing and one that they selected. The bid from my shop was hundreds less than their shop but was still clearly more than they wanted to pay. They decided that they would only pay on the hood damage (around $800) but when I asked them to make that payment, communications on their end ceased with the exception of one follow up suggesting that accounting was working on it. At this point I am still out $2,200. There is not a deal or price that would be good enough for me to consider using Paper Impex again.","stars":1.0}

I went on The Brew Bus with a group of Tampa Bay Yelpers and boy did we have a good time. The Brew Bus picks up at Cigar City and shuttles parties around to breweries around the Tampa Bay area. We chose 3 breweries in Pinellas County for our stops. What was super awesome about the bus is that you have a beer tour guide who gives you craft beers for the whole ride. The beers are all you can drink and our tour guide always made sure we had a beer in hand.

We were in town for a wedding and had heard rave reviews on their sister restaurant, Eat. When we called to make reservations at Eat, they were booked and sent us over to Vacherie. I made reservations for the entire wedding party (10) and sent out the information to everyone. On the day of the reservation, they called and confirmed the reservation leaving a voicemail. Everyone got dressed and ready, grabbed cabs and headed over to the restaurant. When we got there at our reservation time, they told us we were over an hour late so they cancelled our reservation. I played the voicemail for the manager showing her we were on time and had not missed our reservation. Instead of admitting she was wrong and accommodating us with appetizers or drinks while we waited, she insisted we must have called in and changed the reservation and that they were correct and we must not \"know what were talking about\". We gave her multiple opportunities to take the higher road and just accommodate us while we waited. She ended up asking us to leave the restaurant and with a very sarcastic \"good luck with your wedding\" This manager needs a course in etiquette. Needless to say we won't be going back.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Had dinner reservations for New Year's Eve, we ordered at 8:20 PM (Prime Rib and Crab Cakes, were told a few minutes later they were out of Crab Cakes and substituted Scallops Rockefeller). The other couple ordered Grouper and Salmon plus appetizers-about 40 minutes passes and one of the appetizers shows up (Escargot), nothing for anyone else. We ask about the order, were told 'they are backed up in the kitchen' and get salads about 10 minutes later, still no 2nd appetizer. We ask for bread, we told, 'they are slicing it' but nothing appears at the table. Another 30 minutes goes by and the 2nd appetizer shows up (Scallops Rockefeller), we are told, 'the main courses should be out soon', then 10 minutes later and told, 'they will be right out'. Somewhere along the way we do get some bread, although it wasn't exactly 'straight from the oven' as we had also been told or really worth waiting for. It's already 10 PM, by the way. Finally, after numerous conversations with the staff and 'manager', our main courses show up at 10:20, about 2 hours after ordering-the 'Prime Rib', though, looks suspiciously like a STEAK with lots of gristle and fat. I ask the server about it and he admits it isn't Prime rib but 'they wanted to give you something close'. Well, it's red meat, that's about as close as it got. The Scallops Rockefeller were tasteless (other than salt), the mashed potatoes cold and salty and the Grouper and Salmon way overcooked. We ask for the manager again and he apologizes with the convenient story about how they double booked the restaurant due to an on-line reservations hiccup, something none of us believed. We had to ask about how they were going to make this right and he ASKS US what we wanted, maybe hoping we would let them off the hook. Our answer, which was that we didn't want to pay for the food, was followed by an offer to keep the drinks and wine on the tab and take off the food, which we accepted although the proper offer should have been the entire bill. I hate writing reviews like this but facts are facts, I won't be back under any circumstances and they should be embarrassed beyond comprehension. Update: I checked my credit card account online and found they charged me $45.33 for 2 drinks at the bar before we were seated instead of the $20.33 on my credit card receipt. When I called the restaurant about this I was told there were some issues with charges at the bar and it would be corrected before they were posted on my credit card-they weren't so had to call the credit card company and file a dispute. I also need to mention that while we were waiting for an Uber outside the restaurant a random woman sitting at a chair outside somehow managed to hear we had a bad experience and begged us not to write a bad review because the owner is a friend and how","stars":1.0}

They have this nice little system at each table where you put up different colored plastic flag things to indicate if you need help with food, drinks or the games! They know so much about the games so they can teach you the rules if you are struggling. The way their system works, you pay $5 to play games, but they deduct $1 from that for each food and drink item you purchase. This money goes to maintain and invest in their game library, which seems very fair and logical to me! We can't wait to come back and play again.

We ordered one and loved it, and ordered a second one. The server told us that it is cooked with sugar in the dough, so that it crystallizes in the heat and provides extra crunch and sweetness without needing syrup. The vegetarian quiche was also very good and hearty, although the portions are a bit small for the price. Definitely ask your server for jam if your meal comes with bread. The belgian dark chocolate spread and apricot and raspberry jam are very, very good. Definitely recommend.

They are really fast though got our food in under 10 min and the portions are pretty big, but they charge you extra for sour cream! The food was subpar at least the chicken enchiladas were, not very flavorful and their red sauce kinda taste like tomato paste with some salt. I also had a pork tamale which was pretty good but the same red sauce was on that. If you do come here you should get the horchata it is really good and they give you big cups and it is free refills as well!

From the start , she was rude about seating us (I don't know her name as I didn't see a name tag but she was an African American woman with reddish hair & glasses) she got annoyed because we asked nicely if there was anyway we could sit in a booth . This was very early in the day (2ish) so it wasn't busy at all , & there were plenty of booths available . Her reaction had me say it was fine , we will sit where we are . That alone should've made me ask for a different waitress but I didn't because I wanted to give her a chance . So we are seated , she rushes us ordering & gets frustrated when we said we weren't ready to order food yet . I've never seen someone get angry we didn't order drinks & food all at the same time . When the drinks arrived I asked her if they had changed one of the drinks . Am sour but I confused it for the Italian margarita with the shot of am .. my mistake , but all I said to her was \"was the drink changed ? I remembered it coming with a shot\" she very rudely said \"i have nothing to do with it so I don't know\" & walked away . Our food took the longest it's ever taken & I've come to Olive Garden not only every year for my birthday but frequently . Maybe that wasn't her fault entirely . The salad came & she got annoyed we asked for cheese . While doing it she was loudly sighing & asked \"is that enough yet\" in a rude tone .

Without fail, the actual delivery time is always at least double what they tell me, and if I'm lucky, the food *might* not be ice cold by the time it arrives. My personal favorite is when I ordered just before 8pm, and it was delivered at 11:45pm. Yes, that's right - almost FOUR HOURS later. I kept trying to call the restaurant for an update, but since they closed hours before my food was delivered, I could never speak to a person. Go in person, go eat at their location, or look forward to truly delicious leftovers. Whatever you do, don't want until you're hungry to order.

However, some of the less invested employees definitely give an unwelcome vibe. Sometimes they seem annoyed when you ask them questions or they are even playing games and not paying attention to you. I understand it is a gaming atmosphere, but I think if you are working at the front, customers should be your first priority. The atmosphere is very geared towards the gamer. Gaming chairs, neon lights, gaming mouse and keyboard, etc. They also have snacks and drinks you can buy at the front. There are oftentimes a lot of people here, especially during the weekend, so it can get quite crowded and hot (and sweaty!- be careful if using a spot that was just recently occupied). They have many of the popular games, like league and overwatch, but for some less popular games you might need to download it. I've had to download dead by daylight, so when I go I can pretty much only use that one computer unless I want to spend more time downloading it on other computers. Other than that, from my understanding, they wipe their database every few weeks, so the last time I went, I had to redownload the game! And I didn't feel welcome to ask the front desk person if that time could be taken off for free. But despite minor inconveniences, this place is really lots of fun for any gamer. So if you want to go somewhere to play games with no latency by yourself or with friends on good equipment, this is the place to go!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I was in a wedding last Saturday and the bride had appointments for the entire bridal party booked months in advance. Me and another bridesmaid were scheduled for 8am and when I got there to check in, I was told there was not another appointment for 8. When I told her that was incorrect, she said well let me refresh the computer, and lo and behold! The appointment was there. Why would the computer need refreshed for appointments that were made months in advance? Anyway, we got on with our appointments about 15 after 8. We sat down and the girl that was assigned to me handed me the look book in which I inquired if the uptinis were inside. She immediately got an attitude and said we were only scheduled for blowouts and that the uptinis were $90 anyway. In attempt to not bother the bride (who was quoted for everyone to get an uptini) I decided to roll with it and choose a blowout style. When I chose the Hollywood style, it apparently irritated the girl doing my hair because I got more attitude. Back at the wash room the other bridesmaid and I were sitting next to each other and her girl asked if a cold rinse was ok (they asked me the last time I was there too) and my girl says oh yeah, do you want a cold rinse too? We got back and started on the blowout and I asked them to check l the rest of the bridal party appointments so the rest of the girls weren't surprised like we were. They had every appointment for a blowout. Nobody was happy with their hair. They didn't even use hairspray in two of the flower girls' hair so by the time they got back to where we were getting ready they no longer had curls. Do not go here if you have an important event. They do not care. UPDATE: they responded to my review and asked me to email them directly. I did email them and had absolutely no response back.","stars":2.0}

We will definitely be back to this location if we ever vacation here in the future.

Despite our waitress, whom was a little unfriendly and took a while to come back to take our drink and appetizer order, the food; I must say, was pretty damn good. We started with the Mozzarella Fritti, which are made in house and were cooked to perfection. The sauce could have used a little something though. It wasn't really thick enough for my \"personal\" preference, but the flavor was very nice. For our entree we ordered a \"Create Your Own\" large pie with a basil pesto for the base, buffalo mozzarella and crumbled Italian sausage and boy was it delish! I will say though, that I wish they had left the pizza in a little longer and let the cheese melt just a tad bit more to reach ULTIMATE PERFECTION! Haha!

I might not have thought so before COVID, but it feels that way now. Every person on the staff we interacted with was great. Everyone is friendly, accommodating, and professional. The food is nice quality, well prepared, and nicely presented. One downside to this particular location is going to be parking. The restaurant is located in a Westfield shopping mall (with entrances both inside and outside the mall itself) that already had parking problems.

So the wife and I ordered a tall reds and a tall angry orchard. She got the drinks out real fast and as soon as she came back, we ordered the ultimate nachos with chicken (extremely good), a small order of buffalo chicken wings (small order is 10 pieces), and a sharable order of fries. Food came out and I was happy to see they serve celery sticks and carrot sticks for free. Our server also asked us if we wanted ranch or blue cheese dressing which was also free. The atmosphere was a little loud but I expected that on a fight night and actually made being here more fun. The food was very good and filled us pretty well.

Turns out I was a size smaller than I though, apparently the difference between shoe and skate sizes gets larger as the size increases, as my size 14 shoes translated into a size 11 Bauer Skate (Reebok 11s were to small though). The price was in line with online stores, and they were able to sharpen them before I left. Once I got out on the ice, the sales advice seemed good. The 11s felt better than any 12s I'd ever rented.

Super modern decor and you have a nice living room with a fridge & microwave. The microwave is something that almost all the other hotels lack. Food: Not sure if this is just a benefit of the status, but made to order omelettes in the morning, manager's nightly reception (chips, salsa, veggies, cocktails) at night. Gym: Brand new equipment, just like the brand new-ness of the rest of the hotel. They also have a clean pool (non-olympic sized) and hot tub.

Without Chef Jack, I find the food to be bland and the service poor. When we first got there I asked for a cocktail menu at the bar. They scrambled to find one and told us they no longer offer most of the drinks on the menu. Seriously? Already, strike one. Next our group was seated upstairs and our waitress left without giving us menus. We asked for the beer\/wine menu and the food menu. She came back, eventually, with the beer\/wine menu, but no food menu. Geez, is it really that hard??? Once the food menu came we were informed they were out of strip steaks, the one and only beef dish on the menu. We were baffled as it was just 7 o'clock on a Friday night. When our food finally arrived, in would say it was bland at best. I had the seafood risotto, which should have been called shrimp risotto. My first bite tasted like flour. Our server was nice enough, but her service was slow and inattentive. I cannot believe how poor this place has become. Sage, you can be better than this.","stars":1.0}

Unfortunately my last two experiences will be my last and I plan to never come to this bar again. I also have every intentions to share my experiences with all of my family and friends. I was with a very large groups of friends who decided to hang out at The Stick for drinks. The terrible customer service was present as soon as we arrived. A few friends and I decided to briefly step outside and a very young and intoxicated white girl comes running out of the bar towards security and started screaming the N word \"*igger this and that *igger in there shouldn't be here\". My jaw dropped and I couldn't believe what I was hearing come out of her mouth. She was obviously racist and screaming racist comments right in front of this bar. I communicated saying these type of things is inappropriate and her behavior was out of control. I was also with a handful of black friends, so watching this was absolutely disgusting. After having a conversation with her, while she was crying hysterically, she was in fact a 20 year old racist girl in a bar and the bartender was her boyfriend. Now I would think that if someone who was working at a place of business, who had their underage girlfriend acting inappropriately would try to diffuse the situation. This Bartender actually was condoning this behavior and allowed the racist comments to continue. He also said that if we didn't like this behavior, we could leave. Security didn't seem to really care much either. At this point, we didn't want to give this bar anymore of our money and witness any more of this inexcusable behavior and horrible customer service. I made the mistake of going back to this bar for a drink since my friends and I were out barhopping. Hoping it would be a different bartender and things would be better. I was wrong! After sitting at the bar for almost 10 minutes without any one greeting us, the same Bartender was there and took my friends' order and completely ignored me. After my friends got their beers and paid, I asked him if I can get a beer and he refused to serve me and walked away. So it's obvious, his disgusting behavior has carried on into the next day. I waited for another Bartender to serve me and decided that one beer at this bar was the last of it for me. While finishing up our beers, I noticed the same racist white girl from last night. Since her boyfriend is the Bartender, she obviously hangs out pretty frequently.

I spoke with the \"Project Manager\" (Lewis) who told me they would be there around 4:00 since they were running behind. Originally was supposed to be another team but they ran behind too, so Lewis' team was supposed to come out. 4;00 comes and goes, no movers. He texted me shortly after to tell me now he wouldn't be there until 5:20. I called ELM to inquire why they are running so far behind. ELM assured me Lewis' team would be there by 5:20. 5:20 came and went. I texted Lewis at 5:23 with no response. Called him at 5:31, no answer. Called ELM again who weren't any help. Finally got a text at 5:38 that said the movers would be there in 4 minutes. 5:45 two movers finally showed up with no equipment (dollies or tools), as promised by ELM. Also, I had booked and paid for 3 movers, not two. The guys that showed up said Lewis told them there was just one 26' truck and that I was providing the dollies. Never once did I tell anyone I was providing any equipment. I also had told them when I booked there was going to be 1 completely full 26' truck and another half full. An ELM rep (Ben) confirmed that was the case. The guys that showed up were father and son and the son clearly had never helped move before. What should have taken 3 experienced movers (which I was promised by ELM) at most 4 hours took 6.5 hours. This was in large part because they insisted on putting everything in the garage and then only moving it when I told them to. The movers also took breaks, literally every 15 minutes. I watched them get up from break, bring one, maybe two, boxes to the garage, carry my solid oak cedar chest to the front steps and leave it there on the wet ground and they went and sat down in the back of the moving truck. They also brought a couch, that really isn't that heavy, left it in my foyer and went on another break. My wife and I ended up moving it to the Living Room. The movers moved all of the boxes in to the house instead of unloading the furniture first. What this caused was an absolute mess in the house as there was no room to easily bring in the furniture. The guys didn't help put anything together, again as promised by ELM, and we were left with cluttered rooms and my entire family was stuck sleeping on the floor. I was also left with numerous hand prints on my walls, as well as gashes in the walls, and the movers took the protective plastic off of my mattress and got their sweat all over it as they moved it.

My kiddo goes to RoseBuds, the ski school for kids from tots to pre-teens, from never been on skis to triple back diamonds with poles headed for the Olympics. As a local I like to go mid-week, when they only have two lessons a day, but hey, the classes are small and my kid gets more attention. And of course, as a helicopter parent who usually starts hypervenhilating in large groups whenever my kid is involved (worried I'll lose him or worse) it's rather relaxing to have the mountain much to myself. That said, any day of the week is a great day at Mt. Rose. Locals trick if your kid is taking lessons: get your kid the annual pass, so they get the rosebuds discount, and can ski with friends on other days. Me? I can't ski, I took out a whole ski school once, looked like it was right out of a movie. 26 years later I can (sort of) laugh about it, but when I tried it (on the $99 end of season beginner pass - rentals, lessons and lift ticket every day for the rest of the season AND applied to next years pass - who'd say no to that) I was practically screaming all the way down, on the junior bunny slopes and being passed by munchkins no older than 5 at blinding speeds.

You will be waiting for a while. NOTE: On my last visit, I asked for a French Manicure. The lady whipped out the reddish-clear polish normally used for American Mani's. This started an argument. She insisted that French Manicures used the reddish clear polish while I know for a fact that French Manicures use a more opaque pink polish.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in desperate need of some pho, but we live all the way on the northwest side of town. We googled a couple of places and this one popped up. Definitely looked more authentic than a Miss Saigon so we decided to try it. Cute little hole in the wall restaurant with no over the top decorations that needed to impress the customers, the food did all the talking.The Pho was amazing, the servers were beyond pleasant and the two appetizers we got were to die for. We got the crunchy fried chicken wing stuffed with pork (Canh Ga Anjou Thit), and the fresh shrimp and pork spring rolls (Goi Cuon Tom Thit). My boyfriend ordered the Pho with steak slices, flank, tendon and tripe and I ordered the Pho with beef steak and meat balls. I upgraded mine to a large sized bowl for the extra $1.50 which was definitely worth it. The broth was amazing, I wish I could have taken some home with me. Noodles were the perfect texture and there was just enough meat to fill my protein craving. 10\/10 would make the 40 minute plus drive just to eat here again.","stars":5.0}

Chili was delish! I see many winter trips for a bowl of chili! Party melt was on point.

Nice that they acknowledged we were there. Poor girls kept smiling while others seemed to be in a hurry. I really like their process. After receiving our keys \"Haley\" let us know if we needed any local advice on restaurants and attractions just let her know.

The owner was telling me how she would only order the bigger sized live crawfish due to its taste and regardless of price (she cares about how we eat, got to love that). The staff is very warm and welcoming, however don't expect 5 stars service because it's an order at the counter and sit down and eat kind of place. The food is simply delicious, and the gumbo is filled with flavor and is out of this world. They have a bunch of specials during the week which makes this place super affordable considering how great the food is. Don't miss a chance to try this place, it's a five star gem!","stars":5.0}

I recommend staying on the conservative side and ordering items that you know an average sit down chain restaurant cannot really mess up - bone\/boneless chicken wings, chicken tenders and fries, ect. only recommend restaurants like applebees when you are very limited in your options and looking for a sitdown place to eat.","stars":3.0}

She really took the time to listen to where my aches and pains were, and asked me a some questions relating to where that pain could be coming from so she could do her best to work out all my tension. She found all my major problem spots and did an incredible job of working out my biggest, most painful knots. She was great at listening to where I wanted more pressure, less pressure, and which areas to avoid. Normally I don't like to have my face massaged, but she did something with the hot stones that felt wonderful!

I would strongly recommend keeping swim suits, sunblock, and towels in the car. When your kids see the Zoo Cool, they are likely going to want to play. Our two year old ran up and down the water slides for 2 hours. The highlight was the otter feedings at 11:00. We were able to throw carrots and fish heads into the enclosure. We enjoyed it more than the otters. Also, there were crushed penny machines all over the zoo, so be prepared with a few shinny ones.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This review pertains only to Saigon market, I will save the Restaurant for another review. This is probably my least favorite Asian Market in town and probably Asian for that matter. But they have two benefits that earn a visit from me every now and then. Even though they have a very limited fresh meat selection but it is definitely the best out of all the Asian market. You won't find rib eyes or filet mignon here, but more rustic cut such as pork belly, pork shoulder, beef shank, beef loin, and innards. The second benefit is the one male worker, i think he's the butcher, stocking boy, and cleaner. He's pretty fast when it comes to helping you with the meat. If i needed him to cut the meat and bones a certain way, he'll be on it. His English isn't very good but I think he can make out keyword and can help you find what you are looking for. Their vegetable selection is limited and caters to Asian cooking. Out of all the Asian market on Lafayette Road, Saigon has the worst vegetables! They always look like they are dead or near dead. The herbs in the refrigerated section is not too bad though and usually pretty fresh. If you are wanting to buy vegetables though, I say skip Saigon and go to Saraga or Oriental market. Saigon has a similar selection of dried goods and frozen items like Van's Fish Market. Check expiration dates especially on canned goods and I would be careful of frozen items as well. I always make sure I do a thorough examination. Saigon also sells freshly made bake goods and exotic fruits, and you can find them scatter up by the register. The owner usually stands behind the register, she usually doesn't say anything to any of the shopper unless she knows them. I wish she would be more cheery because it kinda ruins my shopping mood because I enjoy grocery shopping. Overall, Saigon would be a MEH experience but the fresh meat selection earns this place another star.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Tokyo Grill and Sushi serves Japanese food that is the equivalent of really good take-out Chinese. They serve hibachi and bento dinners, sushi, and the lagniappe basics like a clear mushroom soup, seaweed salad, and tempura. The sushi was of the quality of what I'd expect from an express place (the scallops were a bit cold in the spicy scallop roll, and the salmon wasn't the fatty, melt-in-your mouth quality I'm used to from going to my favorite sushi place). The food seemed a little Americanized; the sauce that came with the hibachi steak was sugar-sweet. However, the food was better than I expected. This is a mom and pop operation, and they knew my mother's usual order, including a couple hacks like a different dipping sauce and noodles instead of rice, before she ordered. She eats here with her husband every Sunday. She was more than happy with her tempura. My step-father's bento box was huge, and I was surprised at the crisp, fresh quality of the veggies in one of his sushi rolls. The hibachi steak was well-seasoned and of good quality, with veggies that were also well-cooked and good. The clear soup was flavorful and topped with crispy onions. The spicy sushi rolls I ordered were on par with rolls I've had in similar establishments. Where the restaurant really shines with with service and price. We paid less than $40 for sushi and lunches for three people. They have a special on sushi (I'm not sure for how long) where their normally low prices are 30 percent off. Their rolls are already lower priced (for the most part) from what you'd find at the grocery store, let alone another Japanese restaurant. My hibachi steak was around $7 as a lunch special. They also have regular sushi specials that bring the price point even lower ($9 for two select rolls or a little bit more for three). Their service is a little slow, but when we ate (lunch on Black Friday) it looked like there were only two people working between the kitchen and the counter. And they make up for it for being super nice and getting things right, from knowing the orders of their regulars to going out of their ways to offer substitutions and customized orders. So, instead of paying $10 for take-out Chinese, now you have an option to order Japanese food that's just as good but, surprisingly, just as moderately priced.","stars":4.0}

Try it! This is also where you can catch one of the \"horse\"-drawn carriage tours. I say \"horse\" because they actually use huge mules, since they do better in the heat. We had a carriage to ourselves (5 of us) and got a one-hour tour of the city and a nearby cemetery. Doc, our mule, was a tailgater and that alone was fun to watch.

Due to the short line and other extenuating circumstances (like two six-year-old children), I didn't have enough time to study the menu. I ended up ordering the crawfish ettouffe. It was excellent. As we waited for the food to be delivered, I saw ferdi and debris po'boys being delivered, and wished I had taken more time with my order. Oh well, now I have an excuse to go back. As I mentioned, the ettouffe was excellent. My wife had a catfish po'boy, which she truly enjoyed. The kids both had excellent pancakes. All were happy. When you arrive at the restaurant, you get in line to place an order. Once you have placed the order, you get a number and you choose a seat. The order is brought to your table. It made sense for me to give my order to Jane and go look for a table with the kids--we certainly had a better choice.' The restaurant is rather small, and it got very busy at noon. Make sure you time your visit right. Overall, Mother's was an excellent experience. I look forward to going back to try some other unique menu items.","stars":4.0}

My manicure was chipped by the time I got home. They don't use the lights\/fans to dry, only a small little portable fan so you can hold your nails in front of it. That does NOT dry the polish sufficiently. I've been to several other salons lately, that use an OPI product that they drip onto your nails with an eyedropper that makes my manicure (not gel) last for over a week. I was traveling the next day and ended up going to another salon out of town to get a polish change and they did an excellent job.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE This Salon. I was thrilled from the moment I walked into the door. I was greeted, and then offered the drink menu. I chose water, even though you can have wine as well. When it arrived, it was on the cutest tray with a vase with a flower in it and snacks of chocolate, and other nice crackers, pretzels, etc. Then afterwards, I was given a tour of the place. We started with the many colors they carry. All Paul Mitchell. Then my favorite, the \"Shampoo Room\" opened with french doors, and into the darkly lit room with lighted candles and relaxing music playing. The room also smelled amazing!! Then aterwards, while seated in my salon chair, my stylist \"Christy\" went over in detail with paper and pen what I liked and did not like about my hair. It really was a very detailed sheet, so they know exactally what you are looking for. After I explained what I wanted, which was a cut and color, I was wisked away to the shampoo room. There I was treated to a parafin hand dip with mittens on and then set down, I then received a fabulous scalp massage, which was delightful, and a shoulder rub. Then shampoo and conditioner with extra time for it to sink in... I was so relaxed after that it was hard to get up. But once at my hair she consulted with me on the colors and we found a perfect match. i even threw in a few red bold streaks for fun. My color and cut turned out exactally as I wanted and was very pleased. I also love the fact that they recycle and save me money on all my hair products. If you purchase a bottle, and bring it back in for a refill you get it for 1\/2 price! What a deal!!! Plus they also do the popular feathering now as well. I feel my time has passed for that but if I were a few years younger I would definately go for it. So many cool colors. Also, they have the best rewards program if you send in a person to them you both get a 10.00 credit to use. Sooooo, if you decide to go in (and you will love it) please mention my name \"Pamela J\" and they will give you a 10.00 credit off your first visit. They are conveniently located on 19\/Forest Oaks. And are open 7 days a week. Now how many salons do that??? None that I know of. Tell them I saud 'Hello\" and enjoy!!!!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Well I decided to go to four seasons nail on \"1103 Filbert St. Phila PA\" because someone had referred me and said that Henna and Jenn do a great job. Never the fuck again, and for those prices my nails should NOT look like that. I asked if Henna could do my nails but she had someone so Jenn did them. I feel as though for those prices you should listen to the customer on how you want your nails shape etc and especially put enough acrylic on the sides so the nail won't lift, and make sure it's clean around the nails as well, SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO PUT ALL THAT DAMN OIL AROUND THE NAIL. So she started the job, didn't listen to what I said then had someone else finish as far as the polish. And it looks a mess. I got them done on 12\/24\/19 and it's only 12\/27\/19 and already chipping. Like I said I would never referred anyone to this place especially with those prices, I know students that do better jobs than this. and I'm only giving it a 1 star because I didn't have to wait long.","stars":1.0}

I was informed she was busy by the guy up front. He refused to go back and let her know I wanted to speak with her. After watching several other people get there food some with extra food for the delayed service and some with just getting what they ordered our order finally came up at 7:52pm. That is a 27 minute wait for fast food. I asked again to speak to the manager. She told the gentleman who brought our food up she couldn't talk and to handle it. He informed me he was a shift leader and how could he help. I said I want to speak with the manager. When he told her she said I'd have to wait. I said there was no waiting and she could speak with me then. I started to speak and she interrupted. I told her to let me finish. My question was why was no one told in the dining room for eat in or carry out told of a long wait time and how would this be corrected? Brie (the manager) informed me she could refund me my money. I told her I was not looking for a refund but an explanation as to why no one was told of an extended wait. She said corporate never said they had too and that there were large orders being placed inside and through the drive thru. I said that is ridiculous and that all customers should matter. The rudeness I recieved from the moment we walked in to the moment we left has left such a disgusted taste in my mouth that WE WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!!

Why not? We go in and find out that he and his wife (clearly in their 70's) had opened the place recently and had just spent some real money remodeling the building. They treated us like kings and I've been going back ever since. This is a very nice, inexpensive restaurant on The Hill that is most interesting for it's mix of tapas and traditional Spanish (not Mexican) dishes along with traditional Italian cuisine. Everything I've had here has been great. Standouts include the tortellini in a rich cream sauce with nice chunks of bacon and peas and the lasagna. The couple that owns the place are always here including last night when we arrived for dinner at almost 10. If you know anything about the restaurant business, you know every place is better if the owners are involved. Where they find the energy at their age is anyone's guess, but they have a really nice restaurant. Service has always been friendly and helpful.

So far the progress here looks great although I can't speak to what it was before because I'm not from Tampa. What's great about the location here is that it's centered to be an outdoor destination. There are a few shops here an LA fitness and Sprinkles cupcakes as well!! So beyond the fact that it's in a great location this restaurant did not fail to deliver! I will say though our waiter could have been friendlier although I can't say he was necessarily rude either but you could tell he was just going through the motions and probably wanting to get off of his shift already. I had to take off a star from this place for the complicated ordering process. You have a dragonfly card to place on the table when you need the waiter then cards to fill out to order which make no sense and not as logical to understand. It was also very loud where we were sitting so it was hard for us to hear the explanations from our waiter on how to fill it out. We ended up getting a tray of tacos which is about 6 tacos assorted or by choice. We did chicken, al pastor, shrimp and the fish. Out of these id say...forget the chicken and fish (please note I didn't try the mahi) . The fish was breaded which I'm not a fan of and the chicken flavor was not so great. The shrimp I'd get a tray of as well as al pastor. The treys also come with two tamales and Guac. Guac is on point and taste fresh with nice small bits of jalape\u00f1o. Out of the tamales I'd say skip the bean based one...there is another one with green sauce and meat that is delicious!!! Overall pleasant experience and an added plus was the strong drinks! I'd definitely come again but be selective around what you order. The environment is also great for groups.","stars":4.0}

You walk into this dark, little bar met with a weird antiseptic and sweat smell - not exactly what I want in my Mexican joint. My dinning mate and my son sat towards the back in the booths. I was unaware, it being the first time I was in there, but not a place for kids. The waitress literally scowled at my son for most the time we were there. He was just sitting there eating a taco quietly and she and the other waitresses, I could tell, were shit talking us. On to the food. We ordered tacos, chips and salsa and guacamole, and a chorizo and spinach burrito. They give you so few chips that we went through the whole thing and didn't even make a dent in our normal sized salsa and quac. The waitress never came around to ask us if we wanted more. I got the chicken, pez, chorizo, and carnitas taco. The size of the tacos is laughable. They are about 2-3 bites each. The pez taco was very good but everything else was nothing to scream about. The salsas were watery and my dinning mate's burrito was a loosely wrapped tube of rice and some fake meat. This would have all been fine but the price was was too high for what you got. I have taken burritos out of the freezer and heated them up with the same results. Also, for a two bite taco, I should not be paying $3. Most a la carte mexi places are the same price, but give you a real sized taco. I guess this place would be cool if you were going to get really drunk and cram a taco or two in your face, but if you really want a Mexican meal, this is not the place to go. This is just a bar with overpriced, average Mexican food and two meatless options.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Oh my goodness where do I begin!? Well, I have just recently switched my dentist and let me tell you why. When I was 23 I go in for a cleaning and a check up. After having 2 kiddos, it's always good to get a cleaning to help ease inflammation on the gums. Well, let me tell you I go in, get told I have periodontal disease. You have got to be kidding me! At 23!? Highly unlikely right? I watched videos in the room about periodontal disease and different treatment options. Then the assistant comes in to tell me that the dentist and hygenist would be in to talk with me about everything. So the hygenist comes in and tells me she finds all of these problems within my gums. And that I needed grafting to restore my gums. The dentist there proceeded to tell me that if I did nothing about my condition I would lose my teeth by the time I am 25. Well, naturally there went my water works. I was bawling. I mean come on I just had a baby. You expect me to be emotionally together? Not likely. So i had asked for an estimate of everything that needed to be done. It came out to 5800.00! And that was for the perio treatment that doesn't count my \"basic\" work I needed (fillings,deep clean, etc) In addition to that I was told that I needed to have a couple of fillings done. So i went ahead and got only 1 for the time being. You would think routine and no big deal. Especially since I was numbed to no end. Literally. Although the procedure was pretty quick, I was numb for well over 6 hours. I had called to see if it was normal. Get told yes it's fine. After it wore off I was experiencing sensitivity whenever I bit down, talked, or even drank anything. I call them again. They tell me to come on in and have it checked. Okay awesome. Until I get told that it is fine and it was filled correctly that my tooth was just hypersensitive. I felt as though I was being brushed off. So i hesitated on going back. 6 months pass. I'm now 24 at this point. But was pretty self concious to the point where i wouldnt smile anymore. I was scared to have people look at my teeth. So i had decided to get a second opinion. It was then I went to my currently new dentist, had a complete exam with xrays. And guess what. Member that filling I had done? Well, my xray showed that there was decay left over in that tooth underneath the filling I received. The leftover decay had spread to my nerve over that 6 month period. so now I need a root canal on that tooth. SERIOUSLY!? How does a dentist leave decay in a tooth!? What were you planning for this to happen?? So that I would have to go back and dish out even more money?","stars":1.0}

They removed my botched acrylics and Ashlynn gave me a new set of gel that looks exactly like the pictures I showed her.

{"text":"I'd come to pretty much accept that I just wasn't going to be happy with Chinese food in NOLA, ever. After trying several places, and often simply taking a bite and throwing it away, I pretty much decided that good Chinese food would have to wait for trips home up north. One of my best friends is Chinese and invited me to dinner here; I was at Target nearby and agreed to meet up. The food was awesome! We ordered several of the staples but also things I had never tried or seen on many Chinese menus around the city, like the salted fish. This was absolutely delicious, with nice pieces of fish in delicious sauce with eggplant. The noodles were great as well, with nice pieces of veggies as well as pieces of chicken, pork, and shrimp. I didn't really care for the sweet and sour pork, but I don't really like sweet in Chinese cuisine so this was to be expected. I'd definitely make the trip out to Kenner to eat here again. The local Chinese community loves it and the service is super friendly.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I had my dog in the car and was actually going to the drive thru liquor store next to the Pet Supermarket, but I decided my little buddy could use a treat too! So we went in, and immediately my dog started shaking and had an accident. He has only done this 1 time before, and it was at a kennel where he got a bad infection and we suspected something fishy going on, so I was immediately wary (animals can sense things). We picked out a bone and a plush toy, and went to pay. The girl at the register didn't greet me in any way except \"what type of dog food do you use?\" When I answered, she snickered and told me \"yea, that's like...really bad...you should buy our food.\" And preceded to tell me how bad my choice of food is. Well guess what lady? I've been feeding it to my amazing, healthy, adorable dog for 6 years and never had a problem (and each of the 3 vets he has been to approve as well). Also, the day I take advice from an 19 year old wearing a scrunchie in 2014 is the day pigs fly. Store had OK selection and prices, but was dirty (other pet's messes on the floor...at least I had the decency to clean my pet's mess up) and the service was 0\/5 stars. I had to keep my mind focused on the wine I was about to purchase to distract me from telling the checker off. Never going back!

I did not venture inside, though after the boyfriend used the restroom (nice and clean he said!), he said \"it is very ritzy in there.\" Take that as you will. I loved the outdoor deck and patio. Upon arrival, there were no seats on the deck so we opted for the patio. The hostess did come around later and ask if we would like to move to the deck since a table had opened. I found that to be a nice gesture. Music and band were awesome. Sun King reps were there passing out stickers and beads and I did get a free koozie as I ordered a light and delicious Cream Ale. Now then, the menu. The online menu states that they have \"inventive vegetarian creations,\" yet there are only three vegetarian items on the menu: an appetizer, a salad, and the eggplant tower. Disappointing. The menu alone would be a good reason for me not to return to The Jazz Kitchen. As a vegetarian I eat much more than just salads and if you claim to have an inventive menu then for Pete's sake live up to the phrase! In any case, the Strawberry Spinach salad is very good if not a bit pricey. Service was a bit slow but I wasn't in a rush so it didn't bother me much, especially since everyone was very friendly!

Today specifically though, I called in a dine in order and was told 15 minutes. That was at 6:35, and it's now 7:20 and I've been sitting in the restaurant for the past thirty minutes watching as the kitchen filled orders out of turn, and myself as well as 4 other patrons have been sitting and waiting for the food that should have been done a while ago. In addition to our orders being done out of turn, another peso. Had to come back in because their bread pudding was forgotten in their own to-go order.

Ok, so my Burrito was right on top of the Enchiladas and Beans which made my burrito extremely soggy. The Enchiladas were extremely disgusting! The beans had many pieces that were not fully cooked. It was like I was buying into little pebbles. And the rice was just mussy and had no flavor. My Burrito was supposed to be a Beef Burrito with Peppers and Onions, but it was more like a Peppers and Onions Burrito with Beef. And the Beef was very very dry!

{"text":"I'm not sure why a variety of different Asian foods (Korean, Chinese, Thai, etc.) would be a dig on a place. I liked getting sushi, pad thai and orange beef all from the same place. There are still labels of \"coming soon\" next to many menu items, and the menus are plastic and look permanent so who knows how soon that soon is. For an appetizer, my boyfriend and I shared cream cheese and tuna rolls that were fried (called TNT Sushi), and they were definitely the highlight of the meal. Not traditional by any means, but so what? I got the shrimp pad thai. It was not at all spicy, as the menu indicated, and the shrimp was a little fishy tasting. Also, they use small shrimp (not Sea Monkey-sized, but small), where other shrimp dishes I spied had large shrimp. It was tasty but not awesome. My boyfriend got the Ken Shin Beef, which was beef in a tangerine sauce with big chunks of green and red peppers and onions, served with a small bowl of rice. He liked it a lot, I thought the sauce had kind of a strange taste. It wasn't bad, but again, not awesome. The service was friendly and fairly fast. The place is CLEAN. I know it's brand new, but still -- big points for its shininess. The bill was under $28 for an app and two entrees and a diet coke. Some of the prices were really low; you could leave there full and pay under $10. What it all boils down to is this: There are no good Chinese (ok, Asian) restaurants in Fishtown or NoLibs (excepting Koi). It's nice to have a place to go for some reliable staples.

{"text":"Georges Perrier, celebrity-chef owner of this jewel box, has been ruling over his domain for nearly four decades, and is very much a presence here, both behind-the-scenes and in the dining room. The elaborate interior is an homage to an elegant turn-of-the-20th-century Parisian salon setting, with a marble fireplace, pilasters containing silk inlays, and sconces on floral fabric panels amid antiqued mirrors. This isn't a drop-in-on-a-whim eatery; a set $54 lunch is served at 11:30am or 1:00pm, and dinner is offered at 6:00 and 9:00pm on weekdays, with a 9:30pm seating on Friday and Saturday nights. In the evening, you can select from two options - a six-course $138 prix fixe or, for the entire table, a degustation menu priced at $165 per person. Exquisite dishes change seasonally, with selections like scallops with marinated tomatillo and pickled watermelon, the signature galette de crabe, escargots in a champagne-hazelnut-garlic-butter sauce, and veal medallions with English pea puree and mushroom fricassee. The dessert cart includes opera cake topped with 24-karat gold leaf.

I started with a cinamin delicious, light & flavorful monkeybread. I am so mad at myself that I got the small one. I stepped it up with the Buffalo cauliflower, OMG! AN ENTIRE HEAD OF CAULIFLOWER, in Buffalo sauce. I could only eat about a quarter of it, but the flavoring was spot on & it truly looked like a work of art. A little tip, it reheat fabulously & I ate on it for 2 days. I also had to try the bacon & panchetta with 4 dipping sauces, to include chocolate. It was us very good with the smokey bacon and different sauces. I do feel a bit gyped on this item, as only 2 of the slices of bacon were nice & crisp, the others partially cooked & fatty, not appetizing. Inside it is packed, a saw burgers going by with entire steak knives buried in them. The interior has a cool bar in the back. The vibe in the restaurant is kind of no collar foodie. They have many sauces and accompaniments that they sell on the side, that look intriguing. After seeing their dessert cases, I wonder why they even keep Dough. The cases in Datz had more to offer and everything looked quite tempting. Service wasn't great, but they were busy. Yes, I will be returning to sample more unique dishes. What's a girl to do?

I'm not very familiar with poke bowls but love sushi, so figured a deconstructed one could be tasty. And it definitely was! I opted for the one with shrimp, tuna, crab, mango, crunchies and spicy mayo and was pleasantly surprised at how large the portion was....a HEAPING pile of deliciously sticky white rice, topped with the fresh seafood, tons of \"crunchy\" bits and cucumber. The only thing I didn't like was the random addition of whole grape tomatoes - they just didn't fit at all with the dish so I ate around them. Since I got it to go, they put the spicy mayo on the side for me which was a nice touch, but it's highly recommended you really mix the whole thing up together for the full effect. Everything tasted great and I felt full, so I'd say it's worth the price, but at the end of the day I think I'd still much prefer actual sushi to a bowl.","stars":4.0}

My bun was hard in a sitting on a heated surface or under a heat lamp too long kind of way. The fish was cold and just gross because it was old.

I wanted some color for my college graduation and because summer is coming up, so I looked on Yelp to find the best spray tan in Philly- and Bronzed Airbrush is by far the best. I was terrified that I would come out looking orange and had no idea how spray tanning worked, but from the moment I set up an appointment Rachel was so nice, resourceful and flexible. I felt comfortable as soon as she let me in and throughout the entire appointment (even stripping down to just a bikini bottom)! Pricing was great (buy your first tan, get your second free), and my tan came out amazing. It looks so natural (no orange!) and it feels great to have some color again :) I would recommend Rachel and Bronzed Airbrush to anyone looking for a great spray tan, you can't get any better than this!!!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I came to get my hair cut here before taking family pictures. I figured it's close and I just want my hair cut straight across no layers, no bangs, no tapering, just shoulder length straight across. My hair has thinned quite a bit in the last year as I showed her but although it's seriously thin, you couldn't really tell because right over where it's thin I have a few longer hairs that form a soft wave and cover it up nicely. She washed my hair, turned my sideways so I couldn't see in the mirror then proceeded to cut my hair this way. She also blew my hair dry from the side. After I mentioned how I much prefer that length but how it looks so thin. I hadn't realized how thin it was. She charged me extra to blow dry, but it just looked funky so I went home to try to fix it before pictures. I made it a little better but I figured I needed to wash it in order to do it good. I didn't have time for that. The next day I washed it and styled it, and found it wasn't working well but figured it was just not cooperating. The next day I noticed when I put it up that the hair that normally covers up the thin areas was gone. I didn't have time to mess with it but noticed it looked like she rounded out the front which cut the parts that covered my thin hair and it no longer lays the same. When I got home i took time to look closely, she didn't just round it out she took the thin area and cut the entire front portion of my hair short so it doesn't just not cover it, it thins my hair out about 4 times more than it was. I was and am still devastated seeing how my hair isn't growing in those areas, it's not just going to fill in in a few months. Then I go in to confront her and she lied about it. I ask her why she had me turned sideways and she tells me it's because she was styling my hair. No, she cut my hair that way too. Not to mention I've never had anyone style my hair while I was turned sideways. Don't go there.","stars":1.0}

The aromas of fine food wafting throughout the restaurant. And friendly knowledgeable wait staff waiting to bring your dining dreams to life. Radio Announcer in a deep baritone voice: And the Chef is in the kitchen. He sends his food out of the kitchen. It's going, going.... It's gone. Yep! It's gone! He has sent out a home RUN! WHOO!! HOO!!! Audience\/Customer: (Cheering) Whoo Hoo!! My compliments to the chef who hit our dinner out of the ball park. My family went to Western Village Steakhouse for dinner. Everything from the time we were seated to the paying of the bill was superior to most restaurants around town. Our server Karen and waiter Khan have waited on us before. I cannot RAVE about these two enough (super) friendly too. They were both busy and yet gave us their total attention when they were at our table. Our water glasses were filled before we even needed to ask. They were attending to our needs even before we knew we had them. Before we even ordered warm and tasty breads and rolls were placed on our table along with butter, Parmesan, oil and vinegar. We ordered two appetizers. I love the way butter melts on to warm bread or the flavor of fresh bread dipped in vinegar and Parmesan cheese. In no time at all they materialized. The coconut prawns and zucchini sticks were so fragrant and they looked so exquisitely scrumptious. We couldn't help but to devour them. It was then, I remembered I had forgotten to take a photo of them. Hence, a plate of empty appetizers. We then got our soup and salads. I had ordered the french onion. The soup not only looked incredible but was delectable. The broth was a thick, tasty broth and had deep flavor like from a bone broth. My son had a very yummy three cheese soup. One of the stars of the show was the intermezzo which was a limoncello. I can't not even describe how intensely tasty this was. I am salivating just thinking about the flavor and the cold ice feel on my tongue. My daughter and I split the large Filet Mignon. Some bites live on in our memory for a lifetime. This was one of those moments that you breathe and chew slowly and remind yourself to mark this memory. The filet was nicely seasoned and seared on the outside and medium rare on the inside. Such a wonderful melt in your mouth filet. My son's prime rib was very tasty. My husband hasn't stopped raving about his halibut.

A similar purchase was made in South Houston as well, but from a different hotel. Long story short, don't expect \"wow\" when you stay here. The front desk is nice and the staff were very friendly. However, once we got to our 2nd floor room, at the VERY end of the hallway, we realized why it was cheap. The walls were recently patched and painted over, and the painting crew did not mark off or move things. The digital clock in the mirror was unique, but the bathroom needed much more attention, including the leftover pubic hair smeared on the wall of the shower area. Unfortunately I will not be staying here again. The 3-stars is because the location was convenient, the staff were friendly, the bed was soft, and my family lived.","stars":3.0}

The restaurant has a big sign out front to let you know that they have their own parking, but it fails to mention that you have to drive around the block to get there, and God help your undercarriage as you pull in! If we hadn't enjoyed the Urban Cookhouse in Montgomery, AL so much, I would have driven on. The line was out the door; I hadn't realized that it was Thirtysomething Meet Market Day. But the food was our sole objective here. Different menu than the one in Montgomery; not surprised given their local food raison d'etre. I ordered a Cubano, Darling Bride wanted an Urban Cowboy (it's a sandwich), and the Boy ordered a Buffalo Chicken wrap. We all ordered the cheddar pasta as our side, and we got an order of their orange yeast rolls as our appetizer. \"Cheddar pasta\" is their fancy way of saying \"mac and cheese.\" It's pretty darn good. So was my Cubano; no surprise, as I think serving subferior barbecued pork is against the law in Nashville. Judging by the way the others' food disappeared like your friends when there's a couch to move, it was good, too. If they fix the entrance to the parking lot, I'll give them 5 stars.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Curbside pickup is available with identifying signs. You park and the sign requests that you text your name and spot number to said number listed; I did that but after 15 minutes no response. I decided to look up the restaurant number as calling the number listed goes straight to a voicemail. A worker picked up, told her I had been waiting for a completed order to be picked up. She asked my name and order and advised she would pack it right away. Just to give you an idea I placed an order at 440pm was advised it would be ready at 538pm, arrived at 545pm and still had to wait. Nonetheless the order came out, double checked everything (which everything was there) and went on my marry way. After I went to The park to sit and eat, I was first upset about the quantity as it look pretty minuscule however the takeout box is deceiving as it has good depth relative to the size in length so it's plenty of food. I ordered the chicken and shrimp rice with veggies all of which was very good. The food tasted similar as it would have if it were prepared in front of you inside the restaurant. They give plenty of sauces and wet naps with utensils to make for an easy eat. So far during this pandemic, this place ranks very high with regards to taste and similar quality as if the restaurant were running. The server was professional as well. Only thing I would caution would be to order well in advance so you know you don't have to wait long once there. Prices are also in line with what you would pay for IF you did do the actual Hibachi experience so be prepared.","stars":4.0}

They amaze me with how they can style her hair as well. It is a place with cars for the kids to sit in. They can watch TV to keep them still. And the parents are allowed to come back as they like to watch or answer questions. They take walk ins, but you can (and I do) make an appointment. I always call to make an appointment, but there is an online way of doing it. The issue with the online is that you can't book for two kids at the same time and you cannot book the day of. There is also the option of getting a Dad Cut. They have a regular stylist chair (no car) that they will use to give Dad a Haircut. I have not done this, but I may later. If I could change one thing, I would have them ask the parents about tv programming at the check in vs asking the kids what they want to watch. Standard pricing is $13.95 \/ cut.

The strange thing was that the toilet was in its own closet, inside the bathroom. I've always seen the water closet outside of the bathroom. I suppose this was an effort to retro style the room. Room service was quick and the food was delicious (fries). My view was magnificent, across from City Hall. I didn't even ask for that. Unfortunately, the only friendly staff I met was the bell hop who helped me move my stuff from the room to the cab at check out. Everyone else - the front desk staff, the doormen, the other bell hops - didn't look me in the eye and seemed pained to speak to me at all.

{"text":"I cheated on my usual nail salon and instead came to Forum Nails, as I was tempted by the 20% off Grand Opening Sale sign out front. This salon is located in the Kohl's plaza just north of Countryside Mall. My mom and I came in for a mani\/pedi in the middle of the week on a quiet afternoon, so there was no wait. Our original intention was to get the \"usual\" - a shellac mani and a pedicure. However, the manager of the salon kept telling us repeatedly about a new and \"healthier\" alternative to shellac called dipping. It's basically where you dip your nails in powder (similar to acrylic) and the powder is colored so there is no need for polish. There's also no need to sit under a lamp or dryer, as it dries immediately. I was initially hesitant, but after the nail tech basically pestering us into trying it, we decided to give it a go. I must say, I'm glad I tried out the dipping manicure. It's much more durable than shellac and so far is lasting way longer. Yes, it was about $5 more, but worth it in my opinion. It took about 45 minutes for that, then we headed for the beloved pedicure chair next. I usually just get a basic pedicure at my other salon, but they had at least 10 different kinds of upgraded options here. It had been a while since we had the chance to go to the salon, so we decided to splurge. We both got the thai pedicure. Let me say, this was the most relaxing pedi I've ever had in my LIFE. It included hot stone massage on the legs, paraffin wax dip, extra long lotion and oil massage on the legs and feet AND the nail tech took some extra time to fix some issues I was having with my toes. She offered to fix them without me even asking and I really appreciated her taking the extra initiative. The environment in the salon is definitely a step up from the typical mall nail salon. It was well decorated, classy and a very relaxing atmosphere. The techs spoke English well and were very easy to communicate with. This salons prices are a bit higher than average, but the experience and quality is better, so it was worth it in my opinion. I can definitely see myself returning here in the future.","stars":4.0}

I felt the experience at the dynasty extremely pushy. The waitresses with the carts would put food on the table practically placing anything they could. If you did not say no right away they would leave it there and take the card and stamp it. I was very offended. In a normal dim sum restaurant they show their stuff from the cart and don't force it on the table. I do not think it helped that my colleagues did not know what they wanted either. Luckily my table wasn't too picky about their food. Other than our \"food fight\", the food was not bad. I was happy that they had congee which was quite good. The restaurant was quite spacious and filled up fast. Maybe with a smaller group I would go back again but only if someone coerced me.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I have purchased 2 bridesmaid dresses from Sposabella and have had nothing but negative experiences. The first dress I purchased, they sized me completely incorrectly (sized me as a 14 when I am really a 10) and I had to pay over $150 in alterations. Then, they didn't reach out to any of the bridesmaids to even let us know our dresses were ready for pick-up. I live about an hour away, and when I went to pick up my bridesmaid dress, they told me it wasn't in the store, and they'd need to get it from a separate warehouse. They offered to ship it to me for free. However, the second bridesmaid dress I purchased, they also tried over sizing me. When I adamantly refused a size 14, they made me sign some form which claims I will be responsible if the size does not fit, and it felt as if I was being pressured to buy the larger size. Once again, no sales person reached out to me when my dress was ready for pick-up. But with the experience I had before, I knew I could have it shipped. When I asked if they would pay for shipping, they said \"we don't do that, and there's no way that could have happened before\", which the salesperson was blatantly lying. The customer service is terrible and the communication is even worse. If you're a bridesmaid and the bride would like you to purchase dresses here, please tell her to find another more professional salon.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Conner Prairie, as a whole, is way too expensive for the amount you get. We went once when my son was about 18 months and enjoyed it, but never went back because he had way more fun at places half the price. That being said, the Headless Horseman Hayride is the biggest ripoff yet. People rave about it but I truly have no idea what ride they were on, because it wasn't this. We waited in long lines all night to do the various activities, and my now-5-year-old was clearly over it by hour 1. Then we stood in line for 30 minutes waiting to get on the ride. A small group of actors participate in a short song kind of about the Headless Horseman but it was basically \"he is scary and true and he rides at night.\" Ok cool. Then we get on the ride and LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENED. There was no spooky storytelling, no eerie lanterns (isn't this the Prairie?), nothing. There is so much potential to make this interesting and they gave literally NO f's. There were random Halloween decorations, like from Spirit Halloween and Target. A couple people \"popped\" out and made some noise, none of the kids even saw them. Then the horseman just... kind of meandered out from the woods. You could see him waiting. And I've seen ponies at the petting zoo move faster than this horse. He slowly swung his foam sword nowhere near anyone. The only noise was of parents trying to hype up the kids (unsuccessfully). Someone said there was a pumpkin? No pumpkin. Then they made two loops around the same house so we went past the horseman once (boring) then came around and he was just sitting around waiting for us to come back and he swung slowly a couple more times (laughable nonsense). Then it was basically over. I cannot believe I paid money for this. I mostly can't believe how many people said this was \"AWESOME.\" The kids on the ride were actually saying \"what's gonna happen?\" As we pulled back into the little station. My kindergartener said \"wow that was boring, let's not do this again.\" Don't buy the hype. It's a waste of an evening, and you can get better scares driving past people's house decorations for free.","stars":1.0}

I was not a fan of the sauce selection however. I like sweet, thick Memphis-style sauce and all of the sauces at Hendricks were runny and spicy. My friend and the bartender were both big fans of the STL sauce though. I had the potato salad on the side, which I was also not a fan of. It needed more mayo\/mustard. It was too dry and bland for me. I'd still go back to try a different side and to try the extensive whisky selection in the Moonshine Blues Bar, and more of that moonshine.","stars":4.0}

It also comes with fries. I prefer their house made chips but that's just my preference. They also have a variety of house made sauces. I'm not quite sure on the names of each but the garlic aioli is my favorite. It's not too garlic-y and is a perfect addition to my pesto chicken sandwich and as a dip for my chips (or fries, whatever is to your liking).

{"text":"Last night was our second visit to this trendy Carmel small plates bistro. Our first was with a much larger group, and last night was a 4 top. Dishes are served progressively, so you order a little bit at a time, and then order more until you're done. The recommendation is one order per person, per round. We found that this was probably a bit much, and didnt order quite so much. We started with the balsamic bruschetta, simple Mac N Cheez, Bruleed Brie, and French O'Dumplings. The Bruschetta was fantastic, lots of flavors. My parents dont normally like feta, but ate every bit heaped on this dish! The bruleed brie had a sweetly delicious fig jam. Our next course was sweet potato fries, corn creme brulee, and duck drummies. I love the duck drummies in the Thai chili glaze. Its probably my favorite item on the menu! Simple, but tasty. The corn creme brulee had some heat, but the cheeses and sea salt tempered the heat a bit, and left a surprisingly full flavor aftertaste. Our final course was both sets of sliders (turkey and buffalo) and the braised beef. The braised beef was not my favorite. There wasnt anything wrong with it, but it just didnt excite me like so many of the other dishes had. But thats what makes this place so inviting. Since its all small plates, you can share everything, and if something isnt a winner, thats ok because you have plenty of other options to enjoy. Service is laid back, and sometimes feels a little too slow. I also understand that the kitchen can get backed up as each dish requires a certain attention to making sure the presentation and all the unique parts are present. All in all, an enjoyable dinner. I like the concept. My wife and I like to try lots of different dishes, and find ourselves often trying to decide what to order in a restaurant because so many options sound so interesting.

{"text":"Four of us went for dinner on Sunday night (1\/17\/16), and we were excited to come based on what we'd heard about it. However, we were not very impressed based on the high expectations. There are so many great restaurants in New Orleans, and I would not include this on that list after our experience. Some of the food was pretty good, but nothing was excellent. Our primary server was inattentive, and he seemed rushed when he was at our table. There was a female server who stopped by occasionally when she could tell we needed help, and she was very friendly. The place is so enormous, there are sacrifices made when it comes to quality control. We noticed that when food is ready, it's brought up by a food runner and left on a tray in the corner of the room, all the plates covered to keep them warm. We saw some trays sitting for up to 10 minutes before a team of people would come, uncover them and deliver the food to the table on the other side of the room. The tray would always be placed far enough from the table so that people wouldn't notice their food just sitting there waiting to be delivered. Regarding the food... My wife and I shared four dishes. We started with a shrimp and tasso ham dish that was pretty good. It had a pepper jelly with it that packed just the right amount of heat. Then we had a romaine salad that was fine. Nothing to distinguish it from a salad you'd get at any other restaurant. Our entree was the crawfish risotto. The risotto was cooked well, but the overall flavor of the dish was lacking... suffering from a lack of acidity and heat. For dessert, we had the bread pudding souffle, and it was the one thing I'll say was really good. My one complaint about that was the presentation of it. It comes with a sauce (which is crucial), and when they bring it to the table, they immediately jam a spoon into the top of your souffle and pour the sauce in for you. I don't know about you, but I generally don't want someone else jamming a spoon into my dessert before I eat it. Just a weird tableside presentation to do. Overall, the food was just okay. They also have an absurd wine list by the bottle... by absurd, I mean that they hand you a book with hundreds of bottles in it, organized by country\/region. I love wine and know more than many people about it, but this list is overwhelming. I feel that if you have this extensive of a list, you should make a sommelier available to help narrow down the choices. We were a bit paralyzed by the number of choices, and it took us a while before we were able to make our selection. Then we could finally relax and enjoy the company of our friends. Regarding the atmosphere, they like people to dress for the occasion... meaning they want","stars":2.0}

The restaurant is tastefully decorated and has a great indoor space as well as a lovely outdoor space both in front and in the back.

{"text":"I loved this place from the moment I walked in. The decor is rich and colorful - it feels like you are walking into another country. There aren't too many restaurants that you can find both great food and a genuinely unique experience, but Marrakesh is one. As I came with a large group, we had our own room in the upstairs part of the restaurant. We were seated on pillows around a large table, and given towels for our laps. I thought this was pretty strange at first, but those towels sure came in handy as all of the food was served without silverware on shared plates! This was really fun and added to the authentic experience. They bring out course after course of food - way too much for anyone to realistically eat. Some of the courses I loved, some I only liked okay, but that is to be expected with any type of pre-fix menu. Even my least favorite course was still good, and its always fun to try something different! We also ordered a bit (okay.. a LOT) of the house wine, which wasn't anything special but was a perfectly sufficient red wine. Also, it was CHEAP. I think $12 a carafe? Since alcohol is usually SO overpriced at restaurants, it was very nice to be able to drink without breaking the bank. Between the rosewater handwashing ceremony, 7 courses of food and the visits from the belly dancer, we were there over 3 hours. it was a night out all by itself. The only negative that I can see is that three of the courses are meat\/animal based (one with eggs, one chicken and one beef\/lamb) so vegetarians\/vegans probably want to avoid eating here.","stars":5.0}

I had the steak arrachera which came with barley. It came out stone cold, but I was never able to say anything about it, as our server never really came back to check on us after that. Another friend who was with us had the same steak, and his came out hot, go figure. The description also said it came with chimmichurri sauce. I saw nothing but an olive oil drizzle around the rim of the plate. I'd also planned to order a specialty soda, but since the server only spoke to me once, to get my order for dinner, I never had the chance. I tried bites of my friends' dishes as well! The queso was great, and the Brussels sprouts were good, but nothing extraordinary or different than what I'd make at home. The bite of knackwurst I had was kind of bland, and someone from the kitchen finally brought her mustard when she was down to her last bite. Honestly, I wouldn't make a point to return.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Columbia is a Spanish themed restaurant that delivers decent Spanish\/Cuban fare at the high prices you'd expect from airport dining. I was there for breakfast and ordered one of their signature meals. It was presented well and was tasty, however, the dish claimed to have poached eggs and the yokes were solid to the point of being pasty. My biggest complaint would be that I ordered a double shot Americano and they basically charged me for two single shots of coffee for a total of $6.50 something. Seriously, that's ridiculous and completely soured my experience. Gouging customers for an extra shot is ridiculous and unacceptable, especially since there was little to no creme on the shot. When I asked about it, the sever was rather flippant. All in all, it's what you'd expect from an airport restaurant... Average food and service at an above average price. Three stars is generous in my book.","stars":3.0}

One with my Wedgie, one with a pop tart and the other with a half order of beignets. I saw a sticky note that said my second choice of pop tart wasn't available so they gave me the third choice and a half order of something extra!!!! Both of which were AB-SO-LUTE-LY delicious!!! The Wedgie sandwich was super yummy!! The chicken was much larger than the biscuit so I gave up trying to hold it and used the utensils they gave me.

Positives: - Tablets at the front to order. I LOVE places that do this b\/c less human interaction and less chance for servers to mess up your order. - Service is really friendly; I think they made both our orders medium spicy instead of one medium and one xxtra hot, so they brought out a large amount of xxtra hot chili powder for me. - Prices are cheap and portions are large! The chicken is really good too. - Pepper cheese sandwich (fried cheese sandwich) was super good!! - Good beer selections! Negatives: - not all of the tablets worked, which is frustrating to find out after you input your entire order - It took SO LONG to get our food, almost 1 hour which is insane considering it's essentially fast food - Lots of flies flying around, especially near the trash cans which is pretty gross Might come again, but only when I have a lot of time to kill.","stars":3.0}

Poor planning on managements part! Slow complacent service and odd tasting cannoli's! The staff had dazed looks on their faces and took some time to seat us even though most of the patio tables were empty as there were numerous staff just standing around.

{"text":"I used Zippy Shell to relocate from Chicago to Portland. After researching and obtaining quotes from moving companies that ranged from $4,400 (Stevenson Transfer) to $4,933 (Chicago Long Distance Movers) to upwards of $5,000 (Cross Country Movers), I selected Zippy Shell who quoted me $3,503, dramatically undercutting the competition, with a guaranteed delivery of 8-12 business days, not counting weekends, holidays or pick-up. My order was picked up on December 22, and Zippy Shell guaranteed it would arrive, at the latest, by January 11. When did it actually arrive? A WHOPPING 38 DAYS LATER! What transpired was beyond unsatisfactory and, after looking at other online reviews across the country, I conclude is business per usual with Zippy Shell, who knowingly lied to me and broke contract and verbal assurances. After my order was picked up on December 22, it sat at the origin warehouse in Chicago for 24 days. Every time I called Zippy Shell I was met with a litany of excuses: \"freight is working on it,\" \"your order is first in queue,\" \"we're working on contracting a carrier,\" \"the holidays are busy,\" \"there's weather issues,\" etc. It's worth noting that the only major weather system that may have had the force to impact freight was a one-day snowstorm that hit the East Coast on January 4, well into my delivery window and far from the origin warehouse in Chicago. I called Zippy Shell on January 11, my alleged \"guarantee delivery date,\" and spoke with Lauren, a manager at Zippy Shell Florida, and learned my belongings still hadn't left Chicago. She informed me they tacked on an extra wait of 10 business days, with no rebate or recourse offered. She provided the same rehearsed lines I heard from every other customer care agent with whom I spoke. I was upset and dismayed by the total disregard for customer care. Zippy Shell made any attempt to make right for their deliberately misleading guarantee. Feeling helpless and frustrated that my belongings were stuck in a warehouse with no end in sight, I was told I could pay an additional $1,100 to put my belongings in a \"premium lane,\" which is to say that only after I shelled out more money was Zippy Shell willing to talk solutions. In the premium lane my order was \"guaranteed\" to arrive by January 18, as opposed to January 25 if I didn't put more money down, which would be over a month, equivalent to an overseas move, when I am only moving from the Midwest to the Northeast. I was in no way prepared to wait that long. I had taken time off work from my new job anticipating it would arrive by January 11. I was experiencing back and neck pain from sleeping on an inflatable mattress for weeks on end, in an empty apartment. On top of the $3,500, I had little choice but to pay another $1,100 for shipping on a \"premium lane\" because I was desperate not to wait another 10 business days (a full 2 weeks) in an empty apartment on a","stars":1.0}

I appreciate that it's a simple, neighborhood restaurant so the limited menu is not the problem so much, but I usually expect better service in a small, neighborhood establishment. Our waiter literally must have been high on something because he had a hard time describing things to us (\"we don't have green tea exactly but we have a tea that's like a mix of a bunch of things and.. I can't really describe it.. but it's housemade and unique\") and couldn't answer any of our questions about the food. We had to ask for drinks more than once and they would still take a long time to come (I'm talking twenty to thirty minutes). Even after all that, I'd be willing to accept the server as quirky if the food blew me away. But it did not, and I don't think it blew away anyone else. I had the duck meatballs which they should call duck meatball because I only got one. It was good, but I'd had much better duck meatballs just a week earlier at a different place that came in a much larger serving size at a comparable price. Nothing here was bad, and it did just fine as a place to grab lunch, but it wasn't anything special or worth the trip to the Bywater.","stars":3.0}

The first class we came in and we were immediately greeted as we approached the front desk. I let them know it was our first visit. They welcomed us, introduced the instructor to me and my daughter and let us know how the process worked. The class is one hour and there is no wasted time. They move from station to station and get instructions on how to do the work they are focusing on. I look around at all the instructors and students and see many, many smiles and excited faces. I see the kids confidence being boosted as they accomplish the task at their skill level. They are challenged and encouraged. Our instructor's name is Faith. She is doing great with her group.

Then he has the nerve to say that \"we're a no pressure sales team\". Let your actions speak to the kind of salesperson you are and you won't have to mention it. Never again. I've tried to see if the attitude changes overtime and it's obviously imbedded in the organization. Horrible experience. Walked away before looking at any car.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Wow... okay so this place might have been one of the best places we ate at on our entire trip. It was kind of dark inside as well as a divey-type bar.. however the food was absolutely INCREDIBLE. We started with the gumbo... omg.. it was so flavorful and packed with seafood. Boyfriend and I absolutely inhaled it and thought about ordering a second bowl. He ordered the chicken and said it was insanely delicious. I ordered the chef special for the day which was angel hair pasta with soft shell crab. It was so so good. We were also shocked by how great the prices were for the amount and quality of the food. They also have really good hurricanes here! We ordered a few during dinner and we really enjoyed them. This place may not stand out as the most beautiful restaurant or the fanciest, but they have some amazing food and the service was incredible as well. Loved our entire experience here and we found ourselves recommending it to others throughout our time down here. We will definitely be back!","stars":5.0}

Very busy, so staff was pretty occupied. But seemed friendly and very eager to offer suggestions for all those kids (or kids at heart) on the wish lists. Love that they have items for touching and playing with. And even offered another patron to get some big something out and show them. Fun time!","stars":4.0}

I came across Apricot Stone last minute, and I am unbelievably glad we decided to eat here. As the indecisive people we are, we decided to go for the Dinner for Two, which came with the best variety of dishes we could have asked for. The stuffed grape leaves, mujaddara, and spanakopita were remarkable, and the service staff could not have been more nice.

{"text":"I stopped by this afternoon after a workout at the nearby YMCA and wanted a treat. The shop is cute and inviting, and I was immediately greeted when I walked in. There were so many choices of baked goods that it took me a few minutes to take it all in and decide what I wanted. Eventually I chose a Brookie (a brownie with a chocolate chip cookie baked into the top) and an iced coffee. The Brookie was served on a cute floral saucer, and the iced coffee didn't have too much ice. I entered my phone number on the iPad at the cash register to earn a virtual punch (after 10 punches you receive $5 off your order). The staff was friendly and helpful, but they forgot to ask if I wanted room for cream in my coffee (I did) so I had to dump some of it out into the trash at the cream and sugar stand. I also wish they would have had simple syrup, since granulated sugar can be super difficult to dissolve into cold drinks. The Brookie was super soft and rich and VERY chocolatey. I didn't end up finishing the whole thing, and would either split it with someone else or order something lighter next time. The iced coffee was a little bitter, and I noticed on their website afterwards that it is Kaldi's coffee which I don't usually like. Not really the store's fault, just my preference. I really want to come back here and try a salted caramel croissant on a Saturday morning. This place was very cute and had such a wide selection that I'm sure almost anyone could find a treat they liked here. Next time I'll stick to a Chai or one of the cane sugar sodas they had in their cooler rather than a coffee, though.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"The worst experience you can imagine... The worst experience you can imagine. The battery was draining on my MotoZ 3 and I had cracked the camera lens, so I took it in to see what they could do. Matt said that he would order the parts and contact me when they arrived, which he did. I take the phone back and dropped it off, came back several hours later. Matt said that he had good news and bad news...the battery and camera lens seemed to be working fine, but he broke the screen while working on it. The screen had a white stripe running down the right side so one third of it wasn't viewable. He said that he would order a new one and replace it free of charge. Duh. But it would take a few days for the part to get here. At first, I could use some functions on the phone, but as time went on, it looked like ink was bleeding into the screen and eventually became useless. Five days I had to be without a phone...as a business owner. So I go in to have the screen repaired when it comes in, and when he's done, he starts ringing my bill up at the register and says that he'll knock 10 percent off because of the inconvenience. Ten percent off of sixty some odd dollars...a whole six bucks for five days without a phone. Obviously I told him that I wasn't paying and went on my merry way. The battery seemed to be fine until I got down the road...now it's doing the same thing it was doing before I took it to them. Basically, I just took it to them so they could break it more so I couldn't use it for five days and got absolutely nothing out of it except wasting my time. They should rename this dump \"You Break It, We'll Break It Even More...\"","stars":1.0}

{"text":"We have an English Bulldog named Biggie who is now 5 months old. I looked long and hard and a few vets in our area to see who would be the best fit for a) the English Bulldog breed and b) my personality (first time dog owner, I like to ask a lot of questions and don't like vague answers\/being rushed). I came across Dr. Dallago on yelp, researched him (PSU undergrad, PENN Vet School, and has been in the biz for like 10 years I think) and decided to give him a whirl. I like him a lot because he seems like he really likes animals, answers all of my questions, and gives a very, very thorough examination of my Biggie at every appointment. Since I'm a newbie, I don't know if Biggie has an ear infection, if it's weird that he still pees like a girl, and when he should get his family jewels lopped off. Dr. Dallago covers all those bases and more and puts my fears at ease which is all any pet owner can ask for. I also like that the office calls after each appointment to check to see if Biggie had any issues with medications etc. which I think is nice.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. A huge menu. Authentic Mexican menu items (the al pastor tacos were great) . Generously sized margaritas. Great guacamole (creamy and chunky). A decent variety on the kids menu (Mexican dishes and typical kids stuff). The restaurant is only about 5 mins from Sesame Place and is a great alternative to the chains in the area (or the overpriced cafeteria style food at the park). Prices were reasonable. Inside, the restaurant is about twice as large as you'd estimate from the outside. It is in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The best customer service I have ever experienced. I believe the true colors of a business shine though after a sale is made. The walking company has earned my trust and my business. I truly believe it is worth paying the somewhat higher prices here because I know they will stand behind their products. I wanted to invest in a pair of Danskos last spring. With the assistance of one of their sales women, I tried on probably a dozen or more shoes. Although the store was busy, she made time to help me find the perfect shoes. I completely expected her to be annoyed with me based on my past experience at department stores. Instead, she stayed cheerful and helpful to the last. I was delighted with my purchase. A few months later, the shoes broke due to a manufacturing defect. I was crushed because these were my favorite shoes! I thought I was out of luck because I had tossed my receipt. I brought the shoes back to see if they could help me anyway. The manager was there. She was able to look up my purchase and she processed the exchange so quickly I was astonished. She shipped a new pair to my house. I received an email with tracking information right away. My perfect shoe arrived within a week. If you want to buy shoes that come with fantastic customer service I highly recommend the Walking Company. I will definitely be a return customer.","stars":5.0}

Meat servings have gotten skimpier, service is lousy, the front entrance reeks of cigarette smoke. Worst of all, what was fresh is no longer fresh. Recently had a gyro platter, where too much of the rice was hard, and the gyro meat was made up of many narrow slivers of meat that had become dried out and hard. Wife's chicken pita was burnt in spots, from a grill grate that is not regularly cleaned, I guess. They're no longer able to make an order of fries that aren't either soggy or burnt.

{"text":"Been a member for 3 years and it's easily the most expensive gym in the area. They charge you $45 per person a month and then add an accounting charge of nearly $100 a year to cover their credit card fees. They tell you that your membership includes a private trainer, nurse and that they cap membership at a certain #, which is totally bull as they are over 13,000 members. Most gyms in the area are nicer, cleaner and are much cheaper. They have 10 old treadmills for the whole place with a few being serviced for parts at any time. Most of the TV's on the cardio equipment are broke and the main screen is usually on a meaningless channel rather then a sporting event. It's frustrating being a member there as they obviously don't care, but I hate change. Sadly, changes will only come when they feel threatened and business goes south and they will wonder, where did it all go wrong?","stars":1.0}

I had to sit at one of those community picnic table like tables with people I didn't know all up on my hip. I ate the supposed best burger around and was underwhelmed. Fast forward 2 years or so and this time the girlfriend wanted to give it a try since she had not been. This time the place was steady but we were able to get a spot at the bar and my semi claustrophobic issues were solved. She loves a good burger so she order one and I got the Carne Asade tacos. My tacos were pretty tasty and came with a side of beans, pico and slaw to add on top if so desired. I desired. She wasn't talking much while eating but after we left she said she kept biting into pieces of gristle. That's not cool. It's especially not cool since they charge 13.00 for this burger. I'm anti the whole gourmet spend an ass loud of money for a hamburger guy. Especially in my expereince, the cheaper ones are usually better anyway. I will say their homemade ketchup is quite good. I thought it was just a gimmick but it has distinctively smokey sweet flavor which was perfect for their hand cut fresh fries. In closing, I like Cowbell during non busy times but I'll stay away from the overpriced burger.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"well, I should have guessed I would walk away from this place slightly confused when it's called 'Water Ice' as opposed to??? I love me some dessert - and especially the the cold variety on a sweaty summer day, but frankly I am confused by the menu. I 'get' italian ice, though my past experience with it was either in a legit paper cone, or a too-legit Ice Pop sleeve. But this place offers your flavored (water) ice wedged between two layers of frozen custard - named the gelati or blended with frozen custard for a 'shake consistency' misto or blended with frozen custard and other stuff for a 'blizzard consistency' blendini to me - the consistency of ice....well, it doesn't go well with the consistency of cream\/custard - not on top, in middle of, or (especially) blended to water it down - because it is, um, water (ice). So I wish this place luck (and apparently it doesn't need it, as there are multiple locations out there) - and for what I think they lack in for product that I dig, I did like that everyone working there seemed friendly enough. but I think I will be moving on to the gelato shop down the road","stars":2.0}

The mojito was surprisingly sub-par for how simple it is. It was not stirred at all and the proportion of rum to soda was disgusting. The root beer float was an interesting concept with rum, amaretto, root beer and ice cream. This was good, but I felt that if I finished it all I would have been a hot mess on Bourbon Street.

So I got the insalata mista which was pretty good, and then I got the ravioli in salsa aurora, which was amazing. I eat quite a bit of pasta from all different places weekly but it was really different here from what I usually eat pasta-wise, but in a good way.

I had to get another bottle later in the day from vending that was $1.75. Anyway, I ordered the BLTA and a cup of the beef barley soup. It was a cold day and I needed the fuel. The BLTA was amazing. The bacon was thick and perfectly cooked. The greens were lightly dressed and the avocado mayo, yum, just yum. The soup was hot and had chunks of beef, mushrooms and vegetables. My only complaint is the soup needed a little more seasoning for me. If you work downtown, go eat here. They have incredible food that's decently priced.

I kept coming and would always bring a pretty large group of family and\/or friends. It is walkable from where I live and I appreciate the environment\/atmosphere. Unfortunately, I had the worst dining experience here on Friday and decided I will not be coming back ever again. It took almost 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive, the food (only ordered apps) an hour. It was not very crowded either. There was not one apology or explanation for the wait. I was with 3 people. I had wine which was fine. The other 2 people I was with ordered Bud Lights, which were completely flat. There was no head on the beer, no bubbles, and almost gave off a chlorine type after taste. One person ordered another to see if it was our imagination and the waitress came back with 2 beers, though the other person did not order one. One of the two beers was flat and one was good. We thought maybe the tap was changed and that it would be OK to drink from here on out. We ordered 2 more and they were both completely flat again, no bubbles, no head, and tasted bad. We are not complainers but between the wait for the food and multiple (5) bad beers, both people asked to switch out for different beer - a pumpkin cider and a Hogarden. The waitress took the full beers, grunted , and seemed annoyed. Not one apology, which would have went a very long way with us. She came back with 2 ciders (that is not what we ordered) and she rudely said, \"hopefully this is better for you.\" We didn't want to complain again and the waitress didn't really come around much so we drank the beers though one was the wrong beer. The food was terrible. I am not a picky eater or drinker in the least bit. The muscles had absolutely no sauce. They were completely dry, looked like a few dabs of sauce were maybe put on with a sponge. I've never seen or tasted muscles like that in my life. They were fishy, salty, and dry. We ate maybe 5 and the the waitress asked if we were done. We said \"yes\" and she never asked if there was an issue with them like I expected her to. The shrimp were blan but with a fishy taste, which were also awful. The wings and truffle fries were good. That was the only acceptable part of the meal. I regretted not saying something at the restaurant but didn't want to spoil the night and we figured we would cut our losses.

{"text":"My family and I made a stop at John's Roast Pork while driving through Philadelphia. Of course we had to stop somewhere and grab a classic cheesesteak! After briefly scrolling through my options, John's Roast Pork won out, as it was highly rated and conveniently on our way. When we arrived and walked inside, we luckily didn't have to wait too long in line. It was already past the prime lunchtime hours on a weekday, so we were up to order in no time. I decided to go for the classic cheesesteak with American cheese and onions to share with my boyfriend. The rest of my group took longer to decide, and the employees' lack of patience was very obvious. We apologized for being new and not understanding the ordering system, and we received a grunt in return. Maybe it's the city's culture or maybe it's just poor customer service. I'm not from Philadelphia, so I have no idea. After ordering, my dad waited inside for our food to be called and the rest of us when outside to look for a table. Unfortunately, it was a hot and muggy day, and there's only outdoor seating available. About half of the tables are covered (but the shade depends on the time of day), and the others are completed exposed. All of the shaded tables were occupied, so we took a seat in the sun. After about 20 minutes or so, our orders were ready. My first impression after unwrapping the cheesesteak was \"thank goodness I'm sharing!\" because it was huge! Taste-wise, it was good -- not great and not terrible; just good. The cheese and onions definitely carried the brunt of the flavor; the meat itself was on the light side. All in all, I wish I could say that John's was as great as the reviews make it out to be. If the food was stellar, I could easily justify the missteps I experienced, but that wasn't the case. I'd recommend taking your food to-go and excusing the customer service, or maybe consider other options.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"It's been six years since my last review, so time to refresh. We've been to Epi's quite a few times in the last six years, although not in 2020, of course. It has always been fantastic, albeit a treat due to the cost. Once the restaurant reopened after the sale and then the extended closure, we had gotten out of the habit of going, but renewed our relationship with them on our anniversary this summer 2021. We got our favorites of course, ham croquettes, ink fish, and so on. It was a great meal and nice service. We love basque food and Epi's always delivers. On this evening, we did discuss how the meal didn't have the same panache that it always has had in the past - there didn't seem as much care put into the preparation. The croquettes were \"nice\", but didn't have the same ham to potato blend as before. The inkfish was \"nice\", but didn't have quite the same spicing. Maybe we were comparing the meal with good memories, and we both discussed that, but given we felt the same, we went with \"not as much care\" as before. Still it was wonderful, though I decided our need for this conversation cost them a star in my mind. Still highly recommended for Basque food.","stars":4.0}

Thank you for giving us a taste of your family's dinner you prepared for the day. It was such a personal and hospitable act, that I will never forget. Something very important I wish to mention...It came to our attention Saturday when we inquired about making reservation for Christmas Eve that that the Chef's Family can no longer operate dinner service on that evening. We were shocked to find out it has been a hardship for them to do so. It was explained they suffer the loss of wasted prepped food due to so many canceled reservations Christmas Eve... All I can say...it is a real Shame that anyone could or would do this to Chef Alish's Family. They sacrifice the whole day to prep and stock up for the menu, clean to make ready for guests to arrive, stay open to the last possible hour for end of night guest reservations to show (too often not to show) and have to clean up and make ready for the next operating day of service. They did not have the chance to shop for last minute Christmas gifts, attend Christmas Eve Service or have special Christmas Eve Meal as a family out as well. I do not see any special Holiday Meal significance having to eat the left overs from Christmas Eve's prepped in advance menu as their Family Christmas Meal to prevent as much of it from going to waste.

In particular, when you board a Phlash trolley, and before you pay the fare, ask the driver if they are going to the stop you want to reach, and if the trolley will travel the complete route, as advertised. On July 4th, my wife and I boarded a Phlash trolley at 16th and Market St., with the intention of going to Penn's Landing. The driver took our money, and gave us two tickets for single rides. He said nothing at that time to indicate that the trolley would not complete its normal route, nor were there any signs posted that would indicate that the trolley was not going to Penn's Landing. However, shortly after the trolley pulled out into traffic on Market St., heading East, the driver announced on the PA system that the next stop, at 12th and Market, would be the last stop of the day, and that the trolley service was ending. When the trolley stopped at 12th and Market, we asked the driver why, at the time that we bought our tickets, he had not mentioned that service was being halted, and that the very next stop would be the last one for the day. He blustered that he had been making this announcement all along, but had to admit that he had not told us this, before he took our money.

They have dozens and dozens of tables and manage to keep all of them full. They have a long double sided bar that separates two dining areas but every thing is first come first serve. A lot of the speciality cocktails have a speak-easy ingredient list - you know, you don't recognize most of the components of the drink except the word 'gin.' What I did want to try are their dessert Martinis. They were killer. Strong and delicious. Their happy hour food selection is limited. Mostly flatbreads. I had the pretzels with the 3 dipping sauces and it was worth the carbs. Enjoyed the service. As busy as she was, she came around 5 mins before happy hour ended just to make sure she got us another drink order in before the specials ended.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"So impressed!! I've been meaning to eat here ever since they opened up five weeks ago and finally FINALLY I made it here this last saturday. I did have good intentions about coming in here earlier than 2 p.m, and participating in the UYE... but unfortunately I was too tired to get up around 9 a.m to attend. Anywhoo.. I started off with an ice coffee that really kickstarted my Saturday morning.. erm afternoon.. I asked if they had an espresso machine so I could have a latte or something, but they said that all they had was plain old coffee, which was fine with me. I then ordered the french toast w\/ berry compote and that was pretty delicious. It came w\/ a side of syrup, but I didn't even put it on my toast because frankly that would have been a little too sweet for my taste. I give the french toast 4 stars.. simply because it was a little \"soggy\" even in the corners where sometimes if I am really lucky I get it served to me crispy.. the way I like it! My friends got an order of the pork belly beni as well as the duck confit.. I was pretty much salivating when the duck confit came out because not only did it look good.. but it smelled amazing. Portion size was also perfect.. so that will be the thing I get next time I come in. Now.. the pork belly beni was not so perfect.. the portion size was small, friends complained the pork belly was too rubbery.. and overall for $9.00 it simply didn't steal the show... All in all it was a successful brunch out... and although the service was really spotty.. (we had around 3 different people servicing us that day, and we needed to flag someone down for the check) I will definitely be returning.. the shabby chic farm decor and the food is too inviting for me to past up! P:S word around town is they have CRONUTS? here.. hmm I WILL be investigating this rumor next time I come in.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I believe my friends and I stopped here for dinner on our 2nd night out in NOLA. I must say that I wasn't too impressed with this place. We all shared the O'Brian wings as a appetizer which comes with bloody mary dipping sauce. Honestly, I really didn't like the dipping sauce with the wings. I just felt like they didn't really go together all that well. For my entree I had the jambalaya which was alright. It wasn't the best that I've had. It just felt like it was lacking a little bit of flavor. But the hurricane I ordered was very refreshing.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"A standard buffet that tastes a little better than some. Ambiance: Located in Kenner near the Esplanade Mall, NOLA Asian Buffet has ample parking space and a decently big and tall building for its restaurant. It has a nice, fun sign and follows that theme inside. There are murals of local schools, LSU and Tulane, on the yellow walls. There are tables and booths and some windows to see outside. The buffet and hibachi area can be seen when you walk in and the ice cream area is perpendicular to the hibachi area. Overall, the restaurant is kept clean; however, the areas seem to need some renovation, especially unused areas. Food: There was a huge selection of food. Since we went as a group, it was nice to be able to choose which foods we liked to try. There were different sections: fried foods, soups, sushi, standard Chinese food, seafood with snow crabs and mussels, fruits and desserts, and ice cream. My favorite area was the hibachi service, where I chose from the raw food selection, and the hibachi chef stir fried it in front of me. He added too much sauce but the overall flavor was still good. Service: We were greeted at the front door and led to tables, which were then pushed together. The waitress was quick and efficient with our drinks and plates were cleared fast. Every time I left to get food, the dirty plates were gone by the time I returned. Final thoughts: Overall, the food was pretty good, better than some to most buffets I have tried in New Orleans. It was an easy location to park and pretty spacious, despite the needed renovations of the restaurant. An average buffet that I may go again but do not feel the need to recommend.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I'm giving four stars for the charbroiled oysters alone! I was a little hesitant because I prefer raw oysters far more than cooked, baked or fried. When I heard Drago's was popular for charbroiled oysters, which I had never tried before, I had to give them a shot. We ordered half a dozen for everyone to try at our table. It came on a huge plate with ALL the garlic butter and huge chunk of toasted bread. We sort of ignored the bread, to be honest, other than breaking off a small piece for the butter. The oysters, on the other hand, went quickly and we were all impressed with both the size and taste. No need to use the slice of lemon unless you have multiple and just want to try it with the lemon juice. Really great garlic, buttery, grilled kind of flavor, large and meaty, and absolutely worth the two bucks a piece we paid. Allergies aside, I guarantee even non-seafood-eating folks would enjoy it, but don't expect that fresh oyster flavor for those who typically eat them raw. At least half of us ordered the blackened catfish, but there were mixed reviews based on everyone's personal preference on how they like their fish. I've had blackened catfish before, so I did expect a lot more spiciness to it (there was no heat at all), as well as.. well, more blackness. The flavor wasn't there for me in general, and though it didn't have that muddy taste like it can sometimes have, it fell short of my expectations, especially following the charbroiled oysters. Squeezing some of the fresh juice from the slice of lemon it came with helped. I found the fish itself to be cooked quite well, very moist and reminded me of steam or poached fish, though others were used to a flakier fish, the kind that is deep fried, and felt it was undercooked. The catfish comes with collard greens and potatoes as sides, but I asked to substitute the potatoes for grits instead. The were happy to oblige, but forgot to make the substitution, so I ended up with all three in the end. The potato wedges actually ended up being good, though I only had a bite - well seasoned and cooked right. The collard greens had some bacon in it and I think just a touch too much salt and a little too watery for my liking, but overall fine. I could not stop eating the grits - they were flavorful but mild and offset the saltiness of the collard greens, but also were not at all creamy, had some texture, and firm enough to hold shape. Some people may hate for not being \"right\", but I loved it for being different than usual. We had a great time - food was good and service was fast and friendly. If anything, I would recommend coming here just to try the charbroiled oysters!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Hello Yelp. So, I am wondering if Chuck from Daglio's ever responded to my review dated 11\/5\/12 regarding the poor service and food my husband and I received? Ol' Chucky said he did respond, yet, I never received any response. Ol Chuck said it was deleted???? I thought I had emailed him, but he said I yelped it....same thing, different method, IMO. Just want to update you on the latest. Chuck from Daglio's has closed down. I saw this on Facebook and thought I'd comment since I had never heard a word from him regarding the terrible service and food we had received. THIS IS WHAT I POSTED ON IN RESPONSE TO THEM GOING OUT OF BUSINESS (ON FB): 3\/27\/13 Susan Battelle: I won't miss your restaurant because I emailed you regarding the very unsatisfactory service and food we received and I NEVER heard back from you. Was I surprised to not hear back? No! Even fast food joints will recognize their poor service and\/or food and give you compensation. Poorly run. You should have never broken away from Frankie's. tsk tsk tsk. Daglio's response: Daglio's Cheesesteaks and Hoagies Susan, your ignorance is over shadowed by your lack of knowledge on anything to do with food, I did respond on yelp, because that is where you decided to air your problem with me and Daglios ... Yelp took your statements off it's site including my reply back to you. You should have just called Daglios and your problem would have been resolved.

It seeps into your apartment and gets all in the carpet. The outside lights worked maybe twice in over a year which made for dark and dangerous walks to the car. Abandoned vehicles are repeatedly reported and it takes months before they are ever removed. I've lived in many apartments in several states; this was is the worst since living in the hood. The appliances are cheap; the apartments are not ada compliant. The apartments are overpriced and now they are charging for water but not based off of actual use (#of occupants\/sq ft). There is lack of amenities-the pool did not open on time, there is no tennis or golf. They've let the grounds become overrun. No one answers the phone in the leasing office. They screwed up my original lease and instead of notifying me and apologizing, they said I better pay or the bill will be sent to collections. They charged me a ridiculous amount to leave even though I abided by the clauses in the lease. One time when I called corporate, the lady transferred me to pizza place.

This install date was almost 2 weeks later. The installer didn't allot enough time so only finished the bedrooms. Remember they have done tons of units just like mine so how come they didn't know how long it would take. Then come to find out that there is 4 inch gap in the blackout shades in one of the bedrooms. So, what is the point of having them. After calling to complain the they said they would have the installer come back out in a week to fix and do the rest of the install. Needless to say that there was screw up on 1 of the living room shade measurements necessitating yet further delay for final installation and the bedroom gap was still not fixed. However, the icing on the cake was that they didn't even factor in the shades for the kitchen. They had the measurements but didn't produce the shades. Now they are expecting me to pay for them.

Sure, to the average Joe this may seem just fine... but if you know a good bao bun (and I hope for your sake you do!!!) you know that after several minutes of sitting on the table it gets gummy and loses that unique texture that makes it so yummy. DS&M offers a limited dim sum menu but everything is made-to-order and perfectly prepared. We ordered the juicy buns, lotus leaf sticky rice, and dan dan noodles. Everything arrived to the table as it was made (you can tell because it came staggered) and tasted amazing. I can't wait to come back to try some other dim sum options and ramen!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"A cut above the rest. Butcher and Singer provides decadence to the simple American steak house. The menu is traditional American with a major emphasis on meat. Carnivores rejoice because this is where you want to be.... well if you have the money to blow or you're thinking of a deal for restaurant week. Hey, this place has the bone in filets, t-bones, etc. cooked to how you want it. They also have amazing sides such as the mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. And those mashed potatoes are just so incredibly smooth, buttery, and fluffy. However, this restaurant doesn't do their steak tartare just right. I prefer a raw egg yolk to be on top to be mixed it's what the French would have wanted. Overall Butcher and Singer do a lot of things right. Definitely a happy fatass camper over here. There aren't too many steak places (if you say cheesesteak counts... no) to eat at in Philly but this one definitely hits the spot.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This was my first visit to Cooper House. The atmosphere was very nice. Warm and comfortable. We ordered the Mezze plate app with hummus, pickled vegetables, and deviled eggs. The pickled vegetables were 2 pickled jalape\u00f1o peppers and a few slices of carrots and a couple bits of onion. The peppers were tasty, but one guest couldn't eat peppers and was expecting a bigger mix of veggies. The deviled eggs were described as having smoked trout and salmon roe flavors on the menu. Sounded really tasty! While tasty regular deviled eggs, we weren't tasting much in the realm of the extra salty\/smiley flavors described. Overall, the appetizer was okay \/ not bad. I ordered the portobello sandwich. The flavors were excellent! I really enjoyed it! My partner ordered the brisket sandwich - he said it was \"okay.\" My friend ordered the white barbecue chicken which she enjoyed. We went for all of their desserts (they have 3 listed on the menu). I had the cheesecake with apples which did the trick, but did lose a bit of the firmness you get with a cheesecake due to the moist apples being baked into the layer between the crust and cheesecake, perhaps? It was good, though. My partner ordered the ice cream sandwich - not so good. And my friend ordered the kandy cake - she seemed to enjoy it. Overall, an okay first-time experience. Was hoping for a bit more in terms of flavors, but it definitely is not a bad place to grab a bite. I will be back to try their brunch sometime. I'm crossing my fingers it'll be a bit better.

{"text":"I've been to Jones several times over the years. I describe Jones as a restaurant that offers comfort food in a hipster environment. SERVICE Stephanie, our hostess, took us to our table. She was incredibly friendly, chatting with us along the way. Our server was above par. She was patient with us, as we talked and were pretty slow to order. FOOD Calamari appetizer -- the flavor was tad on the salty side, but tender. I wish there had been more meatier pieces. The sauce was mild and went nicely with the calamari. The appetizer was also large enough for the two of us to share. Bottled carbonated water -- they offer carbonated Saratoga water in two sizes: 12 oz and 1 liter. I told our server that I'd get the liter if I could take it home. Our server provided the bottle cap so that I could do just that. Cost: $6+. Chicken and waffles with syrup -- my date ordered this entree and said that the syrup was tasty, though it wasn't pure maple syrup. He did eat everything on his plate, so I assume it was tasty. It appears that the entree came with a bowl of soup. I saw it next to his plate, but I didn't touch it. Deviled eggs -- you get two eggs halved for a total of 4 deviled eggs. We didn't like them. They tasted like an amalgamation of food odors in the refrigerator. My date said he tasted something sour, so I suggested that maybe the ingredients included sour cream. Anywho, we left the other two deviled eggs on the plate, along with what was left over from the halves we tasted. Macaroni and cheese -- it comes with a crumble topping and you can add bacon if you'd like. EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH BACON. So that was a no-brainer. It was pretty decent. I'd order it again if I went back. Our bill came to $50.xx. So, no high highs and no low lows. Just an average experience.","stars":3.0}

Why couldn't they just say 30-45 minutes when we had called? Finding parking in Chinatown philly is a nightmare. Since we ended up waiting for so long, they told us that our order was only partially ready and so they would give us what they had cooked so far of this dish and give us a partial refund on our bill......we got home and we immediately saw why, cuz there were so few! I still liked the dish but come on! I had originally wanted to get one of those spicy salted king crabs but they were way over $30 per crab so I settled for soft shell crabs. It was a nice compromise altho you know, the flavor and texture were vastly different from the king crab. but overall, this place is well known for their fresh seafood options (they walk to the fish tanks (and frog tanks) in front of the store and walk straight to the kitchen where a nice boiling pot of water awaits.

In fact, my friends and I used it as the midway point after every excursion. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Concierge is very knowledgeable about the entire area and gave us tips on how to get around. The wifi at the hotel is great on the ground level but once i got to my room, it was pretty awful. Loading webpages there brought me back to the days of dsl. It was functional and I got to all the sites i needed but it took some time. I was given room 652 which is one of the smallest rooms in the entire hotel. You open the door and the bathroom is directly to your left. If you walk straight, you'll enter the entire room in about three strides. The bed takes up most of the space but you'll have enough room to maneuver around. My girlfriend didn't have much of an issue but I felt a little cramped. The ventilation system is loud. Once it kicks up, you'll notice it but eventually it turns into white noise. What I couldn't get over was the weird noise it made occasionally on top of the system turning on. It sounded like fuzzy static radio noise. Annoying as hell when you're trying to sleep. I wanted to turn off the entire thing but the weather was either too hot and humid or too cold and humid. The worst thing about this (which i didn't notice till the last day) was how filthy the vent is. I went to change the air flow direction and my finger tips were blackened. I took a look and it seems like it hasn't been cleaned in months. Speaking about sleep. If you wake up in the middle of the night to pee, the smoke alarm is annoying as well. It blinks green every minute or so. When the lights are off, it does that AND flicker white. When you get up in the middle of the night, that shit is pretty bright and intense. Oh and the mini-fridge is loud when it kicks in as well. The bathroom is small in size and height. I'm 5'9 and couldn't extend my arms fully to shower. The shower head itself is stuck in place and angled awkwardly which wouldn't have been an issue if the soap dish didn't extend out. I jabs into you when you move in close to shower. My biggest gripe is this. I'm probably just being paranoid but I feel like the hotel read my earlier 3 star review of them (on google reviews) on thur afternoon and were punitive about it.

I will say that there were regulars who came in for fingernails that were loudly and happily greeted, which made me feel like this could be a place where I'd be glad to show my loyalty to. After I was told which tub to sit at for my feet, no one spoke to me again for the next hour. An older gentleman sat down and began to do my feet with barely a nod. He didn't greet me or ask how I wanted my toes cut down but I prefer not to talk and just relax during a pedi so I let that go. He was very aggressive. When cutting down my cuticles he nipped me several times, once drawing blood. There was no acknowledgment or apology. When it came time for the massage he was heavy handed and it was somewhat painful because he used his knuckles to sort of punch the muscle down (he only focused on my calves). I was visibly bruised from his knuckles the next day, not to mention the scab on my toe from where he cut me. When he started to paint my toes, another technician shooed him away and took over. I was given two coats of my color with no base or clear coat on top. She rushed me to the waxing table and gave me the quickest wax I've ever had. When I got home I had to pluck stray hairs. Less than a week later my polish was chipping off. It's now so bad two weeks later that I'll have to get another pedicure before I wear open toes to work.

We came Thursday around 2:30 and there was a line of about 4 people in front of us. It took about 8-10 min which I'm fine with. They're not allowing more then 3 people in the shop at a time. We get inside and try to place our order. The younger Hispanic dude, didn't catch your name - was professional and kept it real. This was 9\/10 last week - we came in and tried to order Uni which you were out of. We then tried ordering oysters which you couldn't shuck because you didn't have enough staff. I appreciate the realness when you said come back tomorrow for sure we'll have more staff. We decide to leave and save the experience for when we can enjoy everything we came for. Plus it was cool you remembered us the next day and welcomed us back. So it's Friday morning at 11:35 and again another line. This time not to bad - no more than 10 min and we were in. Helped right away. Props to the tattooed white dude who helped us. You were honest and helpful and both my girl and I just appreciate the customer service. The dude told us to check back in around 20 min which was perfect for us. We walked around and enjoyed the lazy Friday vibes. Also if you order and plan to eat around the area they'll have you pick it up in the back. He met us outside with a nice tray for the oysters, the sashimi was packed perfectly with ginger and wasabi. The Uni was beautiful but I was a little intimidated. The Sashimi was thick, and tasted sooooo good and it was fresh. The pieces were buttery and I enjoyed that they were cut thicker than traditional sashimi you'd get at a sushi joint. The oysters were big beautiful pieces. I mean they were salty and delicious, the provided us with a good amount of lemon for the dozen we got. Now the Uni was the freakin star of the show. First time trying it and it won't be my last time. Just melted in my mouth each time. Cant really describe it - just something you'd need to try for yourself if you haven't had it. I'm so glad I did.

My photos give you an idea of what the dishes look like but we ordered Homemade sourdough bread; roasted brussels sprouts with brown sugar, burrata, pinenut and bread crumbs; grilled octopus with cannelloni beans; capatelli pasta with potato and fontina; spaghetti with beef ragu; Leslie Chow pizza (winner of the night); double margherita pizza. The pizzas are really stand out. Full bar with some more unique beer choices especially for out of towners. Pricey but worth it for a splurge meal.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I'd definitely like to give the establishment a five star rating because they do have absolutely wonderful food. However, the reason it gets two stars is because of poor customer service across the board. I understand that sometimes when you chose a job you may not really like it but you do have to think about the customers who patronize the establishment you work for a find enough passion to serve them properly until you find something better suited for you. Don't make the customer pay for great food when it comes with bad attitude.","stars":2.0}

Our group was bigger than everyone else in the place combined, but we were an inconvenience to the bartender's conversation with the \"regulars.\" Eventually everything was going well until the server started mixing up everyone's beers.

{"text":"Since our stay here in Philadelphia we have been to this place twice. Both times we have been very pleased with the service and food. This is one of the places I will definitely miss. The Grilled Chicken Torta, is in no way an Authentic Mexican torta like I had assumed when I ordered it, but I was very pleased. So much that I ordered the same thing on our second trip to this place. The Mad Mex original salsa that they use is questionable. Sometimes about the texture, is very unique but I didn't care much for the paste style taste. My husband as well , on both times ordered Quesadillas the first one was carnitas and the second time it was the Mad Mex- chicken, and he has cleaned the plate. The only flaw per say for the second trip was that they did not give him the \"pico de gallo\" salsa but the original paste style salsa. It does no specify on the menu which salsa to get, but nothing that asking the waitress did not fix.","stars":4.0}

Even then she won't acknowledge me until someone else tries to help me and points me to her. Doesn't give updates on when the car will be ready. Most recently, I dropped off my car on a Wednesday and was told it'll be ready on Thursday. So I agreed to getting a rental car (Chevy Malibu) as opposed to a loaner (another BMW). Until almost end of day on Thursday I didn't hear back until i called, then she called back saying car won't be ready until tomorrow. Friday came and went nothing until I called and was then told it'll be ready on Monday that too maybe. No news until late afternoon that too because I called and asked for an update. Was told I'll be informed between 4.30 and 5.30pm. I had to call back at 5.45. Finally got a call back at 6pm telling me my car is ready. I got there by 6.20 to pick it up. Paid for everything and even then the car wasn't really ready until 6.43 (as I type this)! Really annoyed. And I spent $3k. I expect good service for the money I'm spending. I'll be looking into another service center because this is disappointing.","stars":1.0}

Tasted just like I made it at home, though the avocado was sliced nicer than I could. It comes on a nice multigrain bread toast, and the avocado was fresh. The service is super friendly. Came by to ask if I needed a coffee refill, offered free cucumber ice water to drink. Nice. I'll be back.

Typical for this location, they were nearly out of everything. The girl working the counter was incredibly rude as well. Not just to me, but to others who were waiting as well. I am still wondering how does she have this job... After waiting 30 minutes myself, the same employee ends up telling me that they don't have what I wanted and she then just decided not to do business with me. I would say I'm shocked, but I'm not. If you really want barbecue, go to the one on Jefferson Hwy. You can also go to Blue Oak BBQ, or Central City BBQ. You will get your order faster. Also, instead of being yelled at by the employees, you will be welcomed. However, avoid the Veterans Memorial Blvd location at all cost.

A gentleman consulted with me regarding what I wanted to have done and how much to cut her hair which I really appreciated. He also pointed out something that was in her \"file\" the first time I took her which made me feel good as if my Ellie wasn't just one of many doggies. My dog is about small\/medium sized around the 20lb range and they charged me $55 for a full groom; bath, hair cut, nails clipped, etc. My princess was a bit hesitant to go behind the door (its worth mentioning she's scared of EVERYTHING) but when I returned a hour and a half later she was all tail wagging, excited breathing.

{"text":"There is a secret in Glenside and I am about to let you in on it. But first a little background. Now I shop mostly at Whole Foods or Trader Joes and try to do the organic and healthy thing wherever I can afford it. But sometimes I just want something like good, old fashioned, bad for you New Yorker cheese or a potato hamburger roll or non recycled paper towels, you know? And I really find shopping at the huge mega plex Acmes and Giants a nightmare - trying to navigate those sprawling, icy behemoths that have way too many choices, under the glare of florescent lighting, waiting in long lines, masses of people racing about, kids screaming. I literally feel sick when I leave these stores and a couple times on weekends long past I have just left my cart and walked out. So thankfully I have O'Neils market nearby; a small, cute old fashioned grocery with just 5 or so short aisles that contain everything a big store does, just not so many choices. They have a good deli counter with delicious potato salad they make there in the store. Most of the employees are teens and are quite amazingly polite and friendly and (gasp!) helpful. You would think this would be bounty enough but wait, it gets better! Here is the secret.... Color me thunderstruck as I turned my head left one day while passing the meat case and saw an entire endcap jammed full of Irish\/British imports! Things like Irish oatmeal, tins of golden syrup, gravies, cookies or rather biscuits as they are known across the pond, marmite, cans of mushy peas, boxes of Irish tea - and yes, you can buy these kinds of items already at most places but these are literally the UK brands. But what really swiveled my head was the candy, ye gads, could it be true? Right here in lil old Glenside I had hit UK candy nirvana! Colorful piles of Smarties, Maltesers, Cadbury Milk, Lion and Flake bars to name a few caught my wide eyes like a drunk spotting a bottle of scotch at a tea party. (And if you don't understand why inexpensive UK chocolate is better then inexpensive US chocolate search out the article the NY Times wrote about it last year.) And considering they are imported, an amazing bargain with most at only $1 - $1.25 each. They seem to get a shipment every couple of weeks or so and sell out quickly so if I go and the candy is in stock I pile up, usually while humming either \"Hail Britania\" or \"Danny Boy\", depending on my mood. The polite teen at the register fortunately makes no comment about the embarrassingly large pile of Lion and Milk bars as I try to distract them with inane comments about the weather. So now you know the secret in Glenside!","stars":5.0}

At first, we missed this place because it wasn't labeled or marked so we went to the right of the convention center but it's to the left at the dock. I've never been to the dock so I had no idea. We walked up to the dock and met the employee there and she was friendly. She took my card and ID in case we decided to run off with the water bikes but that was understandable. They had bike covers so you're not sitting on a super hot seat so that was neat. She also offered us a water bottle at no charge and gave us a quick demo and safety rules to go over. There is a place to put your phone and wallet so that was awesome and I didn't have to worry about it getting wet. We took off and man, it was nice! Well, at least for the first half and then we got to the University of Tampa and was already tired. It's definitely a workout and it was a hot day, low 90s but the sun was definitely out. Even with the bike seat at the lowest setting, it got uncomfortable so we had to keep standing from time to time. We only did 30 minutes but the lowest time is an hour. I couldn't wait to get back to the dock! It's definitely once in a lifetime opportunity that I won't be doing again but you have to definitely do it once!","stars":3.0}
{"text":"After having an undesireable experience at the W - French Quarters, we decided to move to the Westin, and it wasn't much better. The Westin is a large hotel, with much larger rooms than standard hotels. We stayed in a suite, with separate bedroom, living room, and bathroom, which were enormous. The hotel also features a large lobby on or about the 10th floor of the hotel, with huge windows overlooking the Mississippi River. Also features a fairly large rooftop pool with 360 degrees views of New Orleans. The only thing I didn't like about the Westin is how boring and colorless the decor is. They need Queer Eye for the Straight Guy to go in and remodel the hotel. If you're looking for a hotel that is spaceous with stardard features and bland decor, definitely book the Westin. If you're looking for chic, young, and hip, then book the W Hotel.","stars":3.0}

I ordered a pretzel bread breakfast sandwich (with bacon), 2 grilled cheese sandwiches (with bacon), hash browns and coffee. Yes, we love bacon... LOL! The food wasn't half bad and each sandwich was a pretty good size that got all of us full, hashbrowns had a yummy seasoning and the coffee hit the spot.

Lots of nice tropical plants to make it feel like you're in tropical Mexico. On the door it says $CASH ONLY. Ok so I don't normally carry cash in my wallet but we went in anyway. The menu offers many vegetarian and a couple vegan options. Wow. I'm starting to like this place not because I'm one but maybe because they make healthier foods for a change. We ordered the Breakfast combination plate and the Huevos Poblano. After ordering I walked went across the street (thank God there was Wells Fargo) to try to get cash but it's still closed! Went back to the little one and then they served the food. Wow I'm impressed it seems so simple but it tasted pretty good. Salad for breakfast? I ate it with the special dressing provided on each table! The green Chile tamales is very good, slightly sweet, don't need dessert after that! The Chile rellenos is also very good and flavorful. It's also the little touches that make it different line the freshly cut pineapple with the skin still intact. I'm usually nauseated after eating out because restaurant food are usually greasy and fried; the chef at other restaurants usually uses tons of oil, but not this time! I feel great after eating, the portions are just right, didn't feel like I overate, even the beans are not refried with oily bacon grease. After eating, I had to make my trip out to wells Fargo again to get cash. I would give the little one a 4 star review for being inconvenient and making me go across the street for cash but I'm so impressed with the food and the overall atmosphere of the place that I'm going to award a 5 star!

I purchased quite a few things and my total came to around $80, when I asked why it was so high, I was charged $39.99 for a sewing machine which had a $10 tag on it, in addition to a $39.99 tag. She didn't seem to care when I told her that it had a $10 sticker on it and that was why I bought it. I took it home anyway, and when I thought more about it, the only reason I bought it was because I thought it was $10. I guess the sticker must have been from a previous owner and perhaps a yard sale or something, but since I wasn't a frequent shopper of this store, how was I supposed to know. I called the store and explained what happened and she said to bring ALL of the items back to the store so she could refund me the money for the sewing machine. I told her that I was bringing just the sewing machine back and she could use the receipt to refund my money from the sewing machine and use the numbers from the receipt to re-ring the items... it isn't like they scan they items. I got there and she had the people who were next in line, before I got there, wait so she could process my refund. I thought that was nice of her and the people. But she wasn't very friendly about it, yet she was the one who rang me up the first time. I showed her the yellow tag and explained that is why I wanted it and she said, \" That isn't our tag.\" I told her that she should take the tag off so someone else doesn't make the same mistake. She showed me the green sticker with the $39.99 and said that was their tag. I, again, said that she should take it off so someone else doesn't make the same mistake. I took a picture of the stickers while waiting for her to process the return which consisted of her returning the WHOLE order, about ten or so items AND then having to re-ring it again, minus the sewing machine. While I know that they don't take returns, which I normally wouldn't have cared had there not been a $30 difference in what I THOUGHT it was and what I paid. When I questioned her the first time, when I was there, she just said that the price was $39.99 and there was nothing she could do about it. The sale had been completed and instead of even apologizing for the stickers on it, she wasn't very friendly about it. I've worked in retail for over 10 years and it usually is procedure to acknowledge the customer and say that you are sorry even if there is nothing that you can do about it. That didn't happen. I'm not a huge fan of the customer is always right, but there is no need to be","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Traci is the best!!!! My husband and I had a major kitchen renovation and we worked with Traci W. at 75 Cabinets. Traci is efficient, professional, responsive and wonderful to work with. There were challenges during the project, but we worked the challenges together with our contractor and Traci until a solution was found. (Ours was structural and had impact on our original design). This is an example of great Teamwork! Needless to say, it worked out perfectly!! Traci helped design a perfect space of cabinets and island that meet and exceed our expectations. The cabinets we chose are white sleek and made of good quality. Our island base cabinets are in peppercorn color (love it!) and add warmth to the room!! The contrast is perfect for our space. The shelves are adjustable (in most) and the drawers we picked are nice and deep and hold our pots and pans nicely! The bookend pantries make a lovely symmetrical design to a large wall of cabinets. And the beautiful custom center piece above the cooktop tie it all together so elegantly. We are super pleased and highly recommend Traci and the team at 75 Cabinets, Warrington. We LOVE our kitchen cabinets, design and overall outcome. Thanks so much!!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"So we finally got to taste the \"Tasting Menu\" at Feast. And feast it was. We chose not to do the wine pairings, one of us had to drive and the other was not particularly fond of champagne or white wine. So we started again with their signature Blackberry\/Basil martini on the rocks. We started off with Kangaroo, Alligator & Bison Bites... they were quite large bites. They were delicious (although I thought the alligator was served with an overly spicy tapenade, my dinner mate did not). They were tender and tasty. Next came the salad... which was dressed perfectly. Followed by French Onion Soup, which I thoroughly enjoyed. We also had a basket of sage and black olive bread, so by this time we were getting pretty full. For the entree, we had our choice of Venison & Tiger Shrimp or Filet and 1\/2 a Lobster. So we each got one option so we can taste everything. After tackling the seafood we could barely taste the meats.... so they went home. The Venison and Filet were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. Dinner came with starch and veggies... one of the veggies was Peruivan Mashed Potato (purple potato). Don't know what they did to it, but it was really, really good. We weren't even sure what it was until we asked. Since we packed most of the main course so we'd have room for dessert. We had a coffee parfait in a chocolate cup with a slice of berry scone and a few blueberries for added flavor. That we ate, including the chocolate cup... too good! Then the owner drop by the table to make sure everyone was satisfied and immediately recognized Debbie P from her visits to his restaurants as well as her Yelp reviews. We chatted for awhile... it was nice that he cared. Unfortunately don't think I'll opt for the tasting menu again... not because it wasn't good... it was delicious... but it was too much food for me personally. For big eaters, this is a great value. I will definitely go back, but will order or the regular menu. I've already enjoyed breakfast, brunch and now dinner. But there are so many good options left to try.","stars":5.0}

We ordered pizza, wings, and cheese poppers, etc. The total was $31+ and a tip for the delivery driver. Well after an hour and ten minutes had passed and still no delivery I called to check the status. The guy I spoke to said well he had 3 deliveries and he should be there soon. He acted like it was no big deal to be late. Well when it finally arrived the pizza was COLD, not even slightly warm. The wings were a nasty mess with sauce dripping thru the cardboard box and freezing cold as well. I called back and asked for the manager. Dave said he was the manager so I explained to him what happened. He said well by his calculations they were ONLY 10 minutes late. This was not true and I said the time wouldn't have been an issue if the food would have been warm. He said they keep the items in warming bags. Well I guess those only work for so long. He had ZERO customer service skills. I knew I wouldn't get a refund so I said I would just suggest the hotel remove them for their book of recommended places to order from.

{"text":"This is one I am torn about. The set-up is fine. You feel like you're eating in a low-range restaurant instead of a take-out place. Thumbs up. But the line goes out the door quickly, & not because it's popular but because of poor design. I can see their sales decreasing big-time in cold months. We don't have a decent BBQ place nearby other than Zachary's in Norristown (which is amazing, but not as convenient). I've had the pulled pork, chicken, sliced turkey, brisket & the ribs at Mission. All are adequate, the meat is supposedly fresh (never frozen), no microwaves used (huge plus) & they have enough sauce to suit most palates. For their sides & specialty meat (Ricky's chicken?), holy cow, do they over-salt. All I want is a few gallons of water when I leave. I appreciate their recognition of local law enforcement & standing for the National Anthem daily. Definite thumbs up there. Here's the problem: they are sexist & incredibly wasteful. 'Girls' are hired to do register. (Where are my register girls? Is what I heard tonight.) 'Men' get first chance at every other (higher paying) position. I think I will start popping in & documenting how they speak to their employees, especially the young women. And there is absolutely no recycling. No concern for where their waste goes. If you love America so much, clean it up! It's disgusting that at this point in time, a company doesn't make an effort to reduce their footprint.

We requested a booth and seeing as they were very busy on Saturday, we didn't totally expect to get one. However, we were not only not given a booth, but we were given a two top table clearly placed just to handle the extra Devour crowd in front of the exit door and in full view of the inside of their service area. We were treated pretty shabbily from start to finish. I assume that was due to us being both young and using the Devour menu. We were pushed into ordering Fiji or Pellegrino as soon as we made clear that we were underage and would not be ordering any cocktails. Our salads came out wrong and while the regular menu was explained to us in great detail, none of the devour menu was at all. The highlight of the night in terms of service was the man that brought our entrees out, DJ. He was the only one who accurately read the vibe of the table and treated us like more than an inconvenience. As awful as the service was, we had no complaints about the food when it was correctly delivered, and that's why Ruth's Chris gets two stars instead of just one.","stars":2.0}

The shrimp itself was yummy, but for the stuffed party not so much. I had the shrimp po-boy with fries. The bread was hard after a few minutes and the sandwich itself was dry. The shrimp was tasty though. The service was good. Our server was very knowledgeable.

{"text":"\"We're Gonna Party (Unironically) Like It's 199(0)\" The name alone - Woody's - is your first clue. Like other entertainment venues of its ilk, Woody's lives and thrives unashamedly in the era of T.G.I. Friday's bar-with-an apostrophe 's'. So, don't be surprised when you step through the lavish rainbow sails and find yourself inside what is every lick an early 90s lolly. Upon entry I noticed that all heads were fixated 'video bar'-style on each of four corners, where teeny 19\"-ish monitors treated the crowd to an unambitious and wholly undiscoverable \"club\" music mix that frankly is only known to these very type of TV monitors, and only in gay bars. (Of the Kristine W. variety, only even less well known.) Twenty years of personal research confirms this. Next up: The bold appearance of that indescribably specific lesbian hairstyle. It was everywhere, showing its shagged self on head after head after strong-shouldered, feathery lady-head. An hour in: the music videos stopped, and out popped that Sony INSERT A DVD blue screen that made the moment feel ... so unsmooth. Like having to stop your make-out session to change the CD. Soon enough however some fresh-faced bartender rushed beyond the EMPLOYEES ONLY door (where of course I was leaning) ... and within moments the screens were alight with another weird, unheard-of popstress video. We were back in business. Two hours in: a neck ringed in puka shells (?!); a dude with a shirt that said \"Bay Area\" (that would sort of be like a shirt that said \"Tri-State Area\" or \"Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington MSA\"); and an ambitious older gentleman who kept appearing wherever I happened to be. Three hours in: a moment's canoodle. It was innocent, y'all. The only thing missing was a bit of C&C Music Factory. Everybody, everybody -- that would have made my hallucination complete. When you go, seek out the dark and handsome bartender with that romance-novel cover look -- he's a doll, and he mixed me several perfect (and strrrong) drinks. At $10 a pop (I went top shelf), I was most appreciative. Now, before I disappoint: I cannot report on the dance floor. I understand it's a critical part of the Woody's experience; I just wasn't feelin' the beat. And anyway, let's count our blessings: because middle-aged trolls such as myself have NO BUSINESS appearing on or around dance floors - or frankly, on or around any scene that begins one or more hours after Denny's Early Bird Special.

I went in to ask why only the small received the discount and the man working stated I misunderstood the axxess coupon, and should read it again. You too, can read it attached to this review. Secondary gripe-they have a default tip system. 15% of the total with tax. For takeout. Will not be going back, nor would I recommend it or bring out of towners.

{"text":"We came here for Brunch on a Saturday. The host staff is very nice, the decor of the restaurant makes the place look upscale and they allow dogs on the outdoor patio (called #yappyhour), in front of the restaurant, which is why we decided to sit down for a meal. HOWEVER, the service was sloooow and the food was only diner-quality, and therefore would be considered overpriced comparatively. The 2-3 host came back and forth to the front podium several times, but did not acknowledge the several people standing in line. It took 10+ minutes to even be greeted by the host, at which time we requested an outside patio table since we had our dog with us; and even though there were 2 available tables, we did not get seated for about 20 minutes. Another 10 minutes passed before we saw our waitress, and our water glass was dirty, which they replaced. After ordering, our food took 40+ minutes to be brought out. The waitress did not bring us utensils, and when it was brought to their attention, it took a while before receiving silverwares and napkins. We ordered the 'Double cheeseburger' and the 'Fried Chicken and Waffles'. The 'Double cheeseburger' is suppose to have a \"brisket blend\", but tasted like a greasy diner-grade burger with thin patties. The quality of the burger is similar to what I would buy from a 'Steak & Shake' restaurant, but overpriced in comparison. The 'Fried Chicken and Waffles' was dry. The waffle was dry and tasted overcooked\/burnt. The fried chicken was not moist. When the entree was initially brought out, the single-serving syrup container was filled one-eighth of the way; so when a new one was requested, it did not arrive for about 20 minutes when we were already half-way through eating our food. Aside from the times when we ordered, and the food was brought out to us; the waitress only checked on us a couple of times in the 2 hours we were there, and our water was refilled once in that time period. The service was so slow that we saw other customers, who only ordered a drink\/cocktail get up and leave because they waited 30+ minutes for their drink to arrive. If I have nowhere quick to go, I may visit this restaurant to try their cocktails, which seems appealing, but we did not try this visit. But I would not come here for food, rather if you want diner-quality and diner-style food, then just go down the street to the 'Steak & Shake'.","stars":2.0}

In a recent visit over a serious health need, I was seen by Audry Schafer, perhaps the most incompetent and rude doctor I've ever met. She was clueless, I mean totally clueless and recommended I go elsewhere to get help. Yes, I'm being dead serious. When this was brought up to the clinic manager (on the premises), Meriah Ramirez, she at first assured us she would resolve the issue but then manufactured a complete lie to cover up the incompetence. I must omit details here (there's much more to this story) because we were threatened as we left the office once she realized I had recorded the entire debacle.

OFFICE LOCATION: Nextcare 6238 E Pima, Tucson AZ I'm anticipating a response here (like others complaints have receive) Yes, there may be an attempt to paint over the hellish practices at this Nextcare office, I bet they even recommend I contact wecare@nextcare.com (which I've done already). Heads up.... I'm not interested in an apology or other \"hide the truth\" ideas you might have. Patients need to be FOREWARNED that while your business card says you offer \"caring, excellence, integrity and results,\" in reality you offer none of this.... zero. You should be ashamed of yourselves!","stars":1.0}

Sat at the bar, had the Mezcal margarita cocktail, the wait for a table was over an hour and change so we just decide to eat at the bar. Must try the mushroom toast. Basically just a thick piece of butter toast my bread topped with a parsley aioli like pesto, wild meaty mushrooms, and cheese. Simple but bursting with buttery delicious flavor. I ordered the veal ossobucco (dk how to spell it) pappardelle which was out of this world! The noodle was SO tender and fresh, hubby went with the crab pasta, which had a fresh lemon spicy pepper flavor and topped with a ton of fresh lump crab meat.

{"text":"As other reviewers have said, the concept of Pei Wei is like that of Noodles & Co: pick your sauce, pick your protein, pick your grain. Even though it's a chain, I was pretty excited about this because I like options and variety. Although we ordered together (only 1 table number), my food came out about 5 minutes before my husband's. I ordered the Spicy Korean veggies and tofu; he ordered the Sesame Chicken. Why I gave them 2 stars: -Holy salt, Batman! I don't know about the man's dish since I don't eat meat, but the sauce on my veggies was liquid salt. I thought Spicy Korean meant there were would be lots of flavor, but the only flavor was salt. -Our plates were flooded. Speaking of liquid salt, our food was swimming in sauce. Next time we visit, we'll ask them to go light on the sauce, and I recommend others do the same. -If your order meat, be aware that regardless of the description, there will probably be next to no veggies on your plate. My husband's plate had 3 or so pieces of red pepper and onion. That's it. Now, we will visit again because almost everyone deserves a second chance, but I'm not sure I'm holding up high expectations for this place.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I received a pair of boots from a friend. She said they were from a family member who was in the service, the boots were from a dress uniform. Whatever whatever, they had sentimental value. I was honoured to receive them. They are lace up boots but the previous owner had zippers installed going up the inside. Definitely quicker to put on. Well, the second time I wore them the &$@\"? zipper broke. Argh. I took them down to Arch's and talked to Luis. I'm not sure if that's how he spells his name but that's how you say it. He said he could fix them and you know what? He DID fix them and he did a fine job. He charged me $70 which at first seemed like a lot. When I got to thinking about it it really isn't. It's a fair price for a good repair. I can tell he takes pride in his work. If you look at the pics the boot on the left is the one he replaced the zipper in. Look closely at the pic with the inside of the boot. He put an extra piece of leather in there to reinforce the zipper. Great work! Bottom line, you get what you pay for. Won't hesitate to take my stuff to him. Thank you","stars":5.0}

This time we stopped for my daughter's birthday after a long day shopping at the Outlets across the street. As soon as we walked in, we were seated right away. The decor is very light and airy at this location, you feel like you're in the Carribean. Out waiter was Austin and he was phenomenal!!! Drinks and appetizers came out quickly. He continued to refill our glasses and check on our experience the whole way through. My son ordered the Jamaican Feast, my daughter had the Cuban sandwich and I enjoyed the chicken Cobb salad. My son devoured every morsel of food on his plate!!! The pulled pork and jerk chicken were so flavorful, very juicy too. The jerk was done right, nice and spicy!!! Black beans and rice were great too!!! My daughter, who is usually a light eater, managed to eat the entire Cuban sandwich. She loved it!!!! Cheese was melted and gooing out the sides, perfectly slathered mayo and mustard with great meats. My salad was yummy because of the Island Vinegrette. Nice and tangy. I love Bahama Breeze!

I opened the sandwich and discovered that they forgot to put cheese on both sandwiches. We could have gone back inside to let them fix but didn't want to wait for them to melt the cheese, and didn't want to throw cold cheese slices on top of it. Should have been right the first time. The sandwich was just ok. Soft Cuban bread, scrambled egg, and three small slices of bacon. The hash browns were pretty decent. Greasy and crispy. Overall, would not come back.","stars":3.0}

The remoulade sauce was delicious and it comes with greens and lump blue crab meat on top. You should try these. For dinner I got the pork roulade, and it was amazing. I finished my plate, every last bite. One of my friends got the boudin stuffed quail and it was heavenly, so moist it melted in my mouth. My other friend got the shrimp and grits. It was good, but untraditional. The grits were really good but you didn't get much. The sauce to grits ratio was a little off, but still tasted really good. For dessert we shared the white chocolate bread pudding. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was still really delicious. Downside: We had an 8pm reservation and showed up a few minutes early. We were told that our table would be ready in about 10-15 minutes so we grabbed a cocktail at the bar. The cocktails were really good, but we ended up waiting about 40 minutes before our table was ready. It was a busy Saturday, but to wait that long when you have a reservation is crazy! The service was also a bit slow. Overall, we really enjoyed our meal here. The drinks and food were really tasty. I would definitely recommend this place to others.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Red Bicycle this morning. It was an extremely disappointing experience. We arrived at about 10:15 and ordered two coffee drinks and two crepes. The drinks were ready pretty quickly -- though I was confused as to why they wouldn't use mugs for people drinking coffee at the restaurant, rather than using paper cups -- but were pretty lukewarm and left something to be desired. We sat outside and noticed a group of guys (4-5, most in Red Bicycle shirts, so presumably employees) doing some yard work at the back of the path that goes around the left side of the building. A few minutes later, they moved to the front and began unloading bags of rocks\/gravel from a car and pouring it out onto the small grass area between the sidewalk and the curb in front of the restaurant. So far, a little distracting, but ultimately not disruptive. Once they were done with this task, they turned their attention to the front of the path next to the building, which was right next to our table. I had to stand up in order to let them go by; we soon moved to another table in order to be out of their way, as they were constantly moving back and forth. The group then proceeded to try to take the metal gate there off its hinges, for a reason that is unclear to me, ultimately failing to do so. This went on for several minutes. It was extremely disruptive, given the close quarters and the loudness of that task (loud talking, banging on metal, etc.). They had no regard for the customers on the patio. Why whoever was in charge decided to do this task late on a Saturday morning, with a fair amount of foot traffic and customers around, is beyond me. Simply inexplicable. It did not end there. After waiting for a while (including finishing my coffee), I went to check on our order, politely asking what the status was and mentioning I was just checking because we were outside. It did not seem like the restaurant was particularly crowded, so it felt like a long time to me. The girl at the cash register went to the window to the kitchen, staying there for an unusual amount of time for what ostensibly was a quick status check. She told me \"5 minutes,\" no explanation or apology or anything. I went back outside and we waited more. Probably about ten minutes later, our food finally arrived. Again, no explanation or apology or thank you for your patience. I looked at my email receipt, and it had been about 35 minutes since we had ordered. The food was not too great, definitely not worth the price. Crepes were a bit crispy, and not just on the edges.

{"text":"In a nutshell, Saffron is a FABULOUS place to get terrific Indian food at an affordable price. This restaurant has become a staple for my family. If you have kids that are relatively adventuresome, Saffron can't be beat. But even the pickier child can find something here that they can enjoy. I have three boys, ages 7, 6 and almost 3. My oldest is a total foodie, and will try anything. He LOVES this place! My middle son is picky, picky, picky, and he LOVES this place. My baby won't eat anything that came out of the earth or off an animal (I'm frankly surprised he's as healthy as he is) and he LOVES this place! If you're coming here for the first time with kids, I would suggest coming on Saturday or Sunday for the lunch buffet. Most of the selections are of the milder variety, and they have some dishes that anyone can enjoy, even those who like very little spice. From the minute you walk in the door, the staff is friendly and helpful. You always have water available, your drinks are brought out immediately, they have a ton of highchairs and boosters if you need them, and more than ample seating space. They can accommodate large parties if needed, but they also have quiet, more intimate booth seating. The staff has always been very interactive with the whole family, and my kids have grown to love the people who work here. The owners have children and we often chat about schools, what our kids have been doing lately, etc.. Very down to earth people here. The buffet is large and holds a great variety of foods. We tend to frequent the buffet, especially on the weekends, because it offers a little of everything for our kids and ourselves, and it's more affordable for a family of five. But we've also been here for dinner, and I've never had any complaints about the service. We've never waited for crazy amounts of time for our order to be taken or for our food. I'm sure every restaurant has bad days, but I can honestly say, we've always received excellent service. And that's important when you've got little kids with you. Kids get bored pretty quickly. Regarding the buffet - if you're a newbie to Indian food and want to get your feet wet without going to extremes, come on a Saturday or Sunday for lunch. As I mentioned before, the food is a bit milder, and the items they put out are more family- and beginner-friendly. I've found that on the weekdays, the selections are a bit more unusual and somewhat more spicy, perhaps because of the mostly adult lunch crowd. I've had both, and I've enjoyed both. Even when their food is mild, there is no skimping on flavor. It's always delicious. I read a few reviews on here that were negative. Everyone has opinions on everything, and it's important to look at things from all angles. But I came here as a young married person without kids, and","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Alcohol and cheesecake, the perfect remedy for a sucky day for four hard working executive assistants, right? My girls and I came here tonight to celebrate a birthday among us and to catch up on each other's lives. I've been to this Cheesecake Factory three times now and it gets better with each visit. I arrived first tonight and waited in the roomy and open waiting area. The seating is pretty much blocked from the hostess area view and while it got a little busy with evening diners, it was comforting to know I wasn't forgotten sitting there by myself. Two different hostesses checked on me during the 10 minute wait before my friends showed. Cocktails were in order and once seated and bread and water (didn't even have to ask for water!) were put on the table, we placed our drink orders. I prefer tequila over any other spirit but hate that typical tequila drinks are either some version of a margarita or some sickeningly sweet concoction. The Firefly surprised me with its pleasant but not too sweet taste. Silver tequila with passion fruit, blood orange and a little splash of Prosecco. A pretty little garnish of an orange peel curl topped my drink. Just a sip or two and I was in my happy place. Two girls ordered Little House Salads to go with their meals and they looked like average salads with a nice mixture of greens. The \"Little\" salads were very generously portioned. The Shrimp with Angel Hair was full of plump shrimp and substituting penne for the angel hair was no problem. Dynamite Shrimp was a hit and devoured quickly. One friend ordered the Mexican Chicken Lettuce Wrapped Tacos and they were much larger than she thought they'd be. Pretty sure she enjoyed them. I went with the Chicken Madeira and it was delicious. Extremely tender chicken breast filets topped with gooey, melted mozzarella, asparagus and mushrooms along with a light Madeira sauce. Served with mashed potatoes made it a super comfort food to appease the craptastic day I'd had. We shared a slice of Dulce de Leche cheesecake and the caramel, fluffy tanginess was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Our server brought out a little ice cream sundae after she heard us talking about a birthday and she readily obliged us by NOT gathering her fellow wait staff to sing to and embarrass my friend.

{"text":"We wandered into this bar to get out of the rain after an impromptu visit to Philly. The first thing that put a smile on my face was the well curated selection of spirits. The second thing that stood out was the above par ability on the part of the bar staff; not only were they knowledgeable about what signature cocktails they had to offer they were also game to experiment with the spirits and liquors they had on hand. The prices were very reasonable, but the friendly and exceptional service is what will bring me back. I hope that the management will recognize the talent and friendly attitudes of Kyle, Christian, and Hannah. They made our visit more than just a trip to a bar. I would make this a five star review if I could have bought the kitchen staff a round of beers.","stars":4.0}

Beer selection is pretty good - though really wish they offered a regular selection of porters or stouts to go with all of the lighter varieties and IPA's they offer. Spinach dip is also good - but chips are not always as fresh as we wish. Service is generally good - but sometimes (yesterday for example) it's less than stellar.

Everytime I make these for my guests they are blown away. This is a very small almost easy to overlook restaurant with great bar food and a really cool sports atmosphere.

I would characterize the menu as a mix of Mediterranean and Southern European traditions. They had no less than 6 specials on a Thursday night, which, considering there were only 3 tables there must be some kind of food-costing nightmare... Anywho, Here's the real deal. They have the single most complex, most seductive, melt in your mouth, knock you on your ass Marsalla sauce that I have ever tasted, bar none.

{"text":"Salt Therapy probably sounds a little woo woo to many folks, but it is a very old way of treating respiratory conditions in Russia and Poland. Sometimes we Americans are a bit behind when it comes to these types of therapies.

The St Louis Salt room is a class act and has helped me through the fall allergy season unscathed. The bottom line is that this therapy absolutely works, Clay is awesome (the owner), and the therapy sessions are unbelievably relaxing and comfortable.

The booking was for 6pm and when we arrived was immediately seated upstairs. I must admit the decor and ambience is quite romantic. ( lights low, etc) . It was my hubby and I and one other couple upstairs. So pretty empty. But it was early so maybe it would fill up. Our waiter was super super attentive and was very knowledgeable about the menu. I tried their house ginger beer - which I really liked because it was not sweet. For appetizers I had the crab claws and hubby had the fresh oysters. Crab claws were ok, oysters were nice and fresh. ( we decided on half a dozen mixed oysters). For entrees I had the redfish and hubby had the sword fish. We ordered a side of fries as well. The red fish was nice, sword fish was nice. Fries....... tasty! For dessert we shared the strawberry dessert. ( good recommendation by the waiter). The dessert was delicious. So why only 3 stars?

It's not the delicious food, it's not the wide selection of fancy drinks, it's gotta be something I noticed about the workers.

It Does not matter if the person is working the door, barbacking, bartending or managing, there are amazing beards doing it. I myself am Beard-disabled. It has just never been in the cards for me. My fuzzy Blondes (A barber once called them platinum colored) are thin and weak and barely existent. So when I stroll in, It's like walking into a \"how to be a fucking man\" museum and I admire them from my seat at the bar and order two fancy drinks in copper cups with a side of big fat juicy meat sandwich. for that brief moment in time, I have hope, That one day I can know what it's like to just open my door and scream to the world \" HEY WORLD, I'M GOING TO CHOP DOWN A TREE AND BUILD A COFFEE TABLE TODAY, OR MAYBE I'LL KILL A DEER, AND EAT IT\".

{"text":"Wanted to try a new place. The lobster was the draw. When we first arrived, one of the chefs was at the reception desk and he welcomed us in and told us about his favorite dishes. We were seated promptly and the waiter took our orders promptly as well. The appetizer arrived in no time and was quite delicious (calamari). After that, things took a downturn... The bread was dry and broke apart. It really had no flavor. Our other waiter never came back to refill our drinks and we had to chase the first waiter down to get them refilled. When she finally refilled the glasses, she over poured and the ice went everywhere. She cleaned up 2 of the ice cubes but left the others there to melt. We ended up cleaning it ourselves. The lobster was okay, a little overcooked and tough. I've never had Australian lobster so maybe that's just the consistency. I know we paid in comps and maybe they gave us less than great service because of that but we still tip accordingly. We were all servers @ one time and know how it should be done. We have no problem tipping 25% for a job well done. If you want a really great meal and outstanding service, go to the Steakhouse @ Western Village or even Rosie's cafe in the Nugget.","stars":2.0}

Then I was scheduled for massage that should help me. Well what I received was way bellow my expectations.

For the table, we split the tuna cones, the oyster taco, and the sweet potato beignets. Each of these dishes was very unique in its own way. The tuna cones were like a seafood dessert!

{"text":"News flash: They are moving! Not far - just 3 doors down and staying on Jasper Avenue. Name will change to Tomkat Shoes! Read more about it at the Edmonton Journal here: Trendy, hip... they have some very interesting things, as bleeding edge as Gravity Pope? Can be, but they do have some beautiful footwear. AND (bonus) they stock the store for special feet! On purpose! I have large calves (yes, dancing for years in your pre & teen years still leaves you with larger than average calves), bunions (family predisposition, and dancing again), with wee size 5-6 feet... you got it, hard to find quality shoes at a reasonable price. I walked in to Wener, and had to decide between not two pairs of shoes, but *EVERY* pair I picked out. (There were 8 by the way). They carry La Canadienne - waterproof, salt resistant, and made in CANADA (or Europe). Holey cow are they comfy, and I wear them almost everywhere. Yes, 3\" platforms and heels aren't 8 hour shoes for me, but I'll take them over some painful foot decor anyway. I also love my Miz Moos... those are some trendy draping for my toes! I've bought 5? pairs here... and if I can find shoes, I hope you can too! Sales! Yes, sales! When they clear out - do not pass up a chance to drop in.","stars":5.0}

I gotta say that the inside of the restaurant is way nicer than I expected or am used to compared to other phone places in the city. Rich mahogany and wood throughout. We started with a delicious green onion cake and house made ginger sauce. I could have eaten the sauce with a spoon, it was delicious. For lunch I had the satay beef soup. It was really good with a great balance of noodles and beef. I especially liked that the ingredients were slightly under done and finished cooking in the broth at the table so nothing was over cooked.

{"text":"I really dislike giving bad reviews, but my experience with this particular location left such a bad taste for the Aloft\/Marriott name. We were in town, after the death of a family member and had a reservation with another hotel that fell through the cracks. It was almost 1am and after 7 hours of driving, we just wanted somewhere to sleep. As family of an employee, we stay at Marriotts frequently so the Aloft was something familiar where we knew we wouldn't be disappointed. Our stay started off amazing. The concierge, Rachel was soo amazing and kind, she saved me from being an emotional wreck. We were able to make a reservation for Friday-Monday, sent in our employee confirmation letter, and was off to a hot shower & sleep after a long day. Now, I would like to preface that I understand mistakes happen and it was very late at the time of booking. Fast forward to Sunday, after a long day of planning a funeral, we were told that our employee confirmation could not be confirmed and that we were needing to be charged the regular rate, that our reservation only had us in for one night and that they tried to call us but no number was left and they couldn't do anything because we left our things in our room (completely understandable\/fixable). However, when I tried to ask the front desk to show me my reservation was only for a night because at this point, our card on file was already charged upwards of $800 she rudely cut me off and told me the services would be removed once we check out. Already drained, we just paid for another night and figured we could get everything squared away later. After talking to Tanya over the phone, again, trying to cut us off and leave no room for explanation or resolution. We were told that the mistake was THEY were giving HR the wrong name & confirmed with us that they'd return us back to the employee rate for the 3 days. Upon checkout, we couldn't get a receipt because we couldn't confirm the last name used on the booking (two last names, issues every time not their fault). After confirming, we got the receipt and there were STILL charges of over $400 that were unexplained. Luckily, the sweet concierge at that time called the GM, Dan and he had it figured out pretty quickly. I really wish I could give them 20 stars for the way they handled the situation at that time, but it was all something that could have been avoided had the girls on the second night just communicated with us in a more professional manner. We're a young couple, but it truly felt as if we were being discriminated against and it made an already awful situation worse. The situation on the second night left me in literal tears in the front of the hotel from such a terrible experience and complete misunderstanding. I truly wish that no guest, employee or not is EVER treated","stars":2.0}
{"text":"So first time so I will give a full an honest review. Food was excellent. Hot and fresh and came out pretty timely. For those that have never been you order at the counter and find your seat then they bring your food to the table. All of the ladies who were working on the staff were unbelievably friendly and personable which to me means a lot. For an appetizer I had the chicken bites and barbecue sauce and for my entr\u00e9e I had the hot and spicy hamburger. My wife had the French onion soup for starters and then had a shrimp Po boy. All were excellent. In fact the chicken bites could've been a meal in itself. With a glass of wine and a Coke our bill was $40 which was not bad at all. Now the one negative........ and I am only putting this hoping the owners and managers can correct this... but there was a tall gentleman who I guess was a manager and I thought he was rude to his staff in the kitchen.while waiting to order and pay for our food. I actually felt uncomfortable with the way he was speaking to them and bossing them around. Spoke very down to them. But overall definitely recommend it and we will deathly be going back. Quality place in a great area.","stars":4.0}

And that's saying a lot, being that I've been going to Taco Bell's for four decades, living in six states and traveling in three directions to many more states. Kept everyone waiting and idling their cars for one slow lady who apparently was ordering for a football team size crew. No apologies, no discounts and no napkins from the crewmember. Why is there only one crew member on a Friday night in a major thoroughfare? The other window was not even open to take money, just a bunch of boxes everywhere. No other crew members working that I could see. And I looked. One lone lady. Got the Gordita box limited time special. Mistake. Major heartburn and GERD reflux, literally threw up a little in my mouth. Thought I didn't have that issue too much anymore in life, but had it immediately upon consuming my cold taco shells and the cold Gordita.

{"text":"A lot of people might think that having AAA is only useful if you drive a junky car but that is not the case at all. If I need to buy theme park tickets for out of town guests or when it's time to renew my annual pass this is where I head. Florida residents already pay a cheaper price and AAA adds a discount on top of that. When you do it year after year it really starts to add up. Add that to a few hotel discounts a year and I really feel that I'm getting my money's worth out of my membership. For those crazy moments that life throws at you it's nice to be able to call for help. Getting my friends' truck towed from Orlando after it stranded us there really convinced me the membership was worth it. This office isn't as big as the Carrollwood office but it seems to have all the same services. My biggest complaint is their hours. They're just awful for anyone that works a regular schedule. If they would open for a few hours on Saturday it would be helpful to so many people.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"As a vegan, I really wanted to like this place, but it fell short of my expectations in multiple ways. I visited on a Saturday night while in town from Sacramento. They are located in a strip mall and it's clearly a casual place. For casual dining, the prices are extremely high and they even use paper plates and plastic cutlery for some of the dishes. There are no excuses for using disposable plates and cutlery in a sit-down restaurant with a kitchen. We ordered the Cheese God Chimichanga for $17.17 and the Nachos for $12.12. They had a large party in the restaurant when we came, so it took forever for them to both take our order and for the food to come out. They were clearly understaffed for the size of the restaurant since there were still many empty seats despite the large party and us. When our food came out the vegan asada meat was not hot enough. So not only was the food expensive, it was served like lukewarm. On top of that, it made both of our stomachs hurt after we left the restaurant. I won't be coming back.","stars":3.0}

The quantity of meat that they put in the sandwich and the amazing taste ensured that I'd be back. But when I returned, I didn't get quite the same juicy & tender cuts of meat which I expected. Instead, I got some dry, crappy corned beef. Really regretted it. But still I came back, again and again, hoping to get that tender cut which I got the first time. I never really got it. And now I give up on them. Today I got a half pastrami \/ half corned beef sandwich. Absolutely disgusting. Dry piece of garbage. Didn't finish it. And regretted paying $12 for it :(","stars":1.0}

{"text":"The natural taro boba is amazing! I have to say, out of many Chinese Restaurants I have attended. This would have to be one of the best in town. With great and prompt service, and amazing food. To begin with, this place is close to my work making it super convenient for me to go here here often and have lunch. I was told by one of my friends about this place and hands down, he wasn't joking that it was a great place. The place is sort of hidden but hey like they say, good things are hard to find! The entree I got a was a Vietnamese B\u00f9n special dish with egg roll, pork and shrimp on top of lettuce, bean sprouts, vermicelli noodles and serve with a side of fish sauce and Siracha. The dish really tasted home made, like as if my mom would have cooked it along with great presentation. The entire entree tasted fresh and even the vegetables were fresh and crisp. To end the delicious entree, I had an all natural Taro Boba. That's right ALL NATURAL. Usually boba shops around here use powder or juice for their flavoring. However here they actually get the real fruit and blend it up into the Boba! I can literally taste the little bits of real fruit and that's what I enjoy. Blasting with scrumptious flavor! Overall, I enjoyed this place and will be returning to try out more dishes. The price is pretty decent and it's one of the Chinese Restaurants that I can clearly say. I feel like eating at home!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Review as a customer (not a seller)! I love consignment shops. As a graduate student\/Adjunct Professor, I highly value them. I need to dress professional, yet trendy, and feel good in the clothing I wear. I'm a huge fan of quality over quantity, so I have certain brands that I love...but don't put a huge DENT in my wallet...or more like hole in my purse hahaha. Greene Street to the rescue my lady friends! Sorry, gentleman. This is a girls only club. ;) Perhaps you can shop for your wife, girl friend, sister, daughter, etc., though :) Clothing selection is fantastic. I've gotten several skirts and tops and dresses here. Brands such as Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor the Loft, Lord and Taylor, J-Crew, Banana Republic, etc. Prices are unbeatable. I've gotten tops from 10 to 12 dollars and skirts from 10 to 20... all which you would find in the Loft for hmm 60 to 80 dollars. The price difference is unbelievable. The thing about consignment shops is DO NOT let the fact that this is used clothing prevent you from browsing. Most of the clothes look like they have never been worn. I get the feeling that many people purchase items, don't like them, never wear them, and in return off to the consignment shop to resell.... and in return people like me get them at great prices and look all fancy! tee hee! They have dressing rooms in the back. Nice and roomy. No one is pressuring you to hurry it up, so to speak. All unwanted items are placed neatly on the wrack outside... I never walk into a dressing room with clothes piled all over the floor. Dresses, skirts, tops, pants, are all organized in each isle, by size. Don't miss the clearance wrack!!!! Shoes and purses are also sold here! HUGE shoe selection... I haven't browsed it yet... next time! My only reason for 4, not 5 stars, is two things. One, the store is a bit small. It is located in downtown Lambertville, so the space isn't something that you can really blame Greene Street for. Also, if you are a larger person, it will be hard to find your size or anything at all. Most of the clothing range from XS to L, but even the large seems to be a medium. My mom isn't a very big woman but she has never found anything here. You really need to hunt for the larger sizes if they exist. Luckily, I'm short and I wear sizes from extra small, to small, and from 2-4. I'd say, if you are a size 0 to 8, you will definitely find some nice clothing here. The owners\/staff are friendly, but not overwhelming friendly. That's also a meh. I have a favorite consignment shop closer to where I live and the owners are just fantastic. Don't get me wrong, the staff here is friendly. They just aren't warm and fuzzy. Overall, though, for a shopper such as myself, you can't beat the price for the quality of clothing. They earn","stars":4.0}

{"text":"If you're hungry, heading north in Belle Chasse, and the bridge is up, don't despair. Lucky Garden Chinese, tucked in the inside south bound side of the big curve, is a good choice for traditional (as in American traditional) Chinese food. As one might expect from a more remote place, prices are favorable. Especially noteworthy is the dinner special for $8.95. Most Chinese places have a low-cost lunch option, usually in the six to seven dollar range, but dinner specials under ten dollars are rare. The dinner special portions are very generous. The specials menu consists of two paired entrees and a side of a well-prepared pork fried rice, for most choices. Some of the choices, such as were heavy on the meat. We had the pork lo mien with crab Rangoon and honey chicken with eggroll. There are one and two dollar charges for substitutions and upgrades, but even with those you will still be getting meat and two for less than twelve bucks. The pork lo mien was dark, flavorful, and contained higher than average coefficient of meat-to-other-stuff (i.e., more meat, less stuff). The \"other stuff\" was crisp and fresh. The pork lo mein and fried rice were good, but the real standout on this plate was the crab Rangoon. These delicately fried triangles had one of the creamiest crab centers in our dining party's collective experience. Highly recommended. Honey chicken? The waiter's description of \"chicken strips sprinkled with honey\" evoked an expectation far afield from what actually arrived: hunks of white meat chicken encapsulated in breading and coated with a sweet sauce. When measured on the breading density spectrum, the coating falls somewhere between tempura and fairway corn dog, moistened by that sauce that definitely had real honey in it. Not my favorite, but if you like meat deep fried with breading and sweet sauce, try it. The egg roll was fresh, crisp, and otherwise unremarkable. The ambiance is pleasant and familiar: a large room with a few Chinese lanterns along the side. A large party of folks of Eastern origin came in and claimed a big table. My wife and I looked at each other and simultaneously said, under our breath, \"now there's a good sign\". If you have a child in tow, ask to sit (or just choose to sit) away from the annoying TV on the wall in back--especially if you're dining while \"Biggest Loser\" is on the air. \"Look, Daddy, that man has boobies!\" is not exactly the most appetizing topic for table conversation--especially if Daddy does indeed look.","stars":4.0}

The decision was made easy when all the new ones had a stand in excess of 22 inches in width. My stand can only take a 23 inch or smaller in width. All the new 32 inch Samsung had either a 27 inch or greater. I would have had to buy a new stand which might have cost me 100 dollars or more. So I had them fix it. It took only 2 days to fix it. What had happened is my led lights had burned out. They gave me a great tip for a longer lasting tv. They said turn down the backlight to 50 % of the setting. My settings goes from 0 to 20. So I now keep it at 10 as compared to 14 which I used to have it at. They said it prolong the life of the LED lights in the back. So I thought that was great advice. So far I'm very happy with the TV. They are very friendly people. I highly recommend them.","stars":5.0}

Apparently she is supposed to be knowledgeable in car wash operations. It left a dent in the hood of my car, which they basically told her that corporate wouldn't accept liability for, because the roof rack is an after market item. Amd somehow free detailing vouchers are supposed to make for a) the damage to the rack, and b) the damage to the hood. Thanks a lot, Prime.

{"text":"Until recently we have been the proud owners of 5 dogs (3 large and 2 medium sized) and 11 cats. Due to our precious pets' old age and suffering from cancer we now have 2 dogs and 9 cats. We have entrusted our animals' health care to Ehrlich for many many years. After several bad experiences with a few local veterinary offices we were extremely relieved to find a team of vets, nurses and administration staff who genuinely all care deeply for our pets welfare. What a joy and comfort it it to be positive that everyone will do their very best to treat our pets with gentleness and respect, whilst exploring every avenue of healing in an endeavour to enrich their lives. The facility is spotlessly clean, tours are available without prior notice which is a great indication of how your pet will be treated in your absence. Ehrlich has invested in the most up to date equipment, treatments and training for all of their staff and the results are outstanding, several of our pets have enjoyed many extra good years thanks to this great team. In summary, Ehrlich is probably not the most inexpensive veterinary facility in the area but, in our opinion, it is second to none. We would far rather pay a little more for Ehrlich to get it right the first time, than pay once, twice and on occasion three times and still not have a correct diagnosis.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"We went here today for lunch and although the food was good, we left less than impressed. I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich but modified it to make it healthier and my boyfriend ordered a burger. My order was off of the menu that claimed that if my food wasn't on the table in 15 minutes it was free. I guess that didn't apply because my boyfriend didn't order off that menu and our food certainly took longer than 15 minutes. There were two tables around us that ordered after us but got their food before us. When our food did come out, my bottom bun was soaked in my salad dressing, so I had to get a new bun. No biggie I guess. After we were finished our meal, we asked for the bill and gave our server some cash and asked for change. She brought change, but only in bills. I was a little annoyed because it forced me to leave either a bill (and our order was not expensive and the service was not that good) or leave no tip at all, which isn't fair.

I'll start with the positive portion of the review first. My wife absolutely loved her hot meatball sandwich -- she loved everything about it (except the price). Now, sadly, on to the less favorable part. I was thoroughly disappointed by their cheesesteaks, which, in my opinion, were undersized, overpriced, devoid of flavor and almost devoid of cheese.

After an eternity our meals came, I ordered the taco salad thinking it would be a \"healthier\" choice. I got a pile of cat food on top of fried taco shell and some other ingredients that was an unappetizing pile of slop. My friend ordered enchiladas in red sauce that were so salty they were inedible. The best thing was the iced teas which there is no refills unless you pay additional. This place had the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted. They tout that they are authentic Mexican food, but that is NOT accurate. I have been to many Mexican food places with 'authentic' Mexican food, and this place was not one of them.

We were quickly greeted by our obviously experienced server who helped move our table-cluttering towels and condiments to the side and our drinks came quickly. My mouth watered as I read Joel and John's reviews of the poboys (I would follow these two to the poboy promised land, no questions asked), but I promised Hubby pizza (and I had Eggs Cochon still hanging on to my ribs from brunch, so roast beef felt a bit like a death request). I ordered a pepperoni thin crust and he ordered an Italian sausage thick crust, both personal sized. I kind of wanted to start a \"help feed Morgan\" campaign when I read her trick about eating the saltines with butter and hot sauce, but after waiting and waiting AND WAITING for our two little pizzas, I totally understood, appreciated, and considered (although did not partake in) her growly tummy fix. I don't even want to know how long tables of 4+ were waiting. **Disclaimer: There was no question that we showed up on \"one of those days\". The servers were clearly overwhelmed, we heard a crash behind our table and one server got carried into the back by another, the owner was in the house, etc. Rough days happen and today R+O was certainly feeling one of them.*** The long wait was easily forgiven, as our rockstar server made sure we were updated on our order status and our drinks were properly refreshed. The pizzas came out. Hubby's was steaming hot. Mine, not so much. They must has screwed his up and put mine under a heat lamp. The proportions of cheese, pepperoni, sauce, and crust were all good. The crust was a bit hard and chewy for my liking. After two of my small slices, I needed a break. I tried a slice of Hubby's thick crust pizza and I almost couldn't finish it. The flavor was good, I just has such a hard time working through it. I will most definitely be back to try the roast beef poboy.

I rushed over to my connecting flight and barely made it to find out that there is an hour and a half delay because of gate delay at Boston Logan. The delay isn't too miserable, but I am stuck on a plane and wanted to get a bite to eat after my 5 hr flight! US Airways could've given me some sort of warning about the flight status so I'm not waiting on a non-moving plane for an hour and a half.... (6\/12\/2011) I was going to leave my review at that with two stars, thinking \"Ohh maybe the trip back will be better than the trip there...\" False. I checked into Boston Logan in the morning and took the train into the city to do some exploring that I wasn't able to do that week because of work.

I got to the airport where they told me if I was there sooner, they would have put me on the next flight which I missed due to my useless conversation with the US Airways employee. (6\/16\/2011) I was rescheduled for a 5am flight, comped a room at the Wyndam (due to my persistence in requesting a comp for something), and was told where to pick up my luggage.

{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite pizza and cheesesteak spots but things are quickly going downhill. I ordered a calzone that came with pepperoni in a giant clump that made it impossible to eat and only enough sauce for 1\/4 of the entire calzone. It went dryly down but caused a majorly upset stomach the next day for all involved in eating it. Letting that go and giving Westshore Pizza another chance after about 2 weeks, I stopped in to order a chicken cheesesteak to go during what seemed to be a slow time given that there were only about 2 tables occupied when I walked in. Now I know that this is a slamming delivery business because I have placed orders and received them in less than 25 minutes so I am aware the kitchen is busy even without bodies dining in restaurant. I figured that I would be in and out within 15 minutes. WRONG! Not tonight. I don't know what was going on in the kitchen but I waited 40 minutes for one sandwich! And watched as 4 different delivery drivers came and went with hands FULL of orders. That isn't even the worst part! When my sandwich was ready I couldn't wait to get home to dig in to what is normally a pretty darn good meal... And there was NO CHEESE ON MY CHEESESTEAK . Now that is a pretty elementary mistake in my opinion. So I got back in the car and brought my sandwich back. I was told he would make me a new one but watched one of the cooks come out of the kitchen a minute later saying \"ok, no cheese\" and handing the cashier the bag I had JUST given her. Let's not forget that another customer was waiting for a called in order for 20 minutes with me and was still there when I left with my cheesesteak for the SECOND time (after double checking that there was actually cheese this time). Now when I got home again the meat was luke warm, sparse, and had large bits of steak mixed in (which I don't eat). The roll is usually steamed and a bit gooey by the time I get home and it wasn't even warm enough for that to happen so the whole thing was mediocre. The fries were also soggy and limp by the time I got to them which has become the norm even on a good night so I don't order them. Overall I am very disappointed by the meal I received tonight. It will be quite a while before I want to have Westshore Pizza again.

{"text":"My two sisters and I came here around 3 PM on a Wednesday and got seated right away. I'd definitely recommend coming at an off time to avoid the long waits that other reviewers mention. I'm not sure how the burgers here compare to others in Nashville, but as a visitor I have to say that it was simply an average burger. I've had my fair share of great burgers in Dallas and Los Angeles so that's the level I'm comparing on. I give them credit for their unique burger options such as the mission city burger and for using unique bread, but the basics of the burger didn't particularly stand out to me. I tried both the cheese burger and the mission city burger. The cheese burger is topped with three different cheeses and garlic aioli. I love cheese, but there was way too much cheese on the burger. I also think I wasn't particularly fond of one of the cheeses in the mix, but I couldn't quite tell for sure. Potentially a result of the over powering cheese, nothing stood out about the meat. It definitely didn't taste bad and I finished it, but it doesn't deserve more than 3 stars. The mission city burger on the other hand had a more balanced flavor profile. I enjoyed this burger more than the cheese burger, but I once again couldn't distinguish anything in particular about the meat due to the toppings. Nonetheless, it was good and deserves 4 stars for its creativity and taste. I also got to try the tater tots, regular fries, and sweet potato fries; all of them were pretty good! The Pharmacy has a pretty cool vibe and their patio is a great place to spend a nice afternoon, but unfortunately the food didn't quite live up to the hype for me. Don't get me wrong: the burgers aren't bad, they're just not great. If I were to return, I'd probably get the pharmacy burger as I prefer simpler burgers so I can really taste the meat. Nonetheless, I'd say come check it out because I seem to have more of an unpopular opinion. My sisters loved the burgers here and I'll admit I am a bit too meat focused when judging a burger so my opinion may not be the best.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"A table of two friends catching up ended up being a full out birthday cake celebration. There was a high nod of approval from a 5 year old on both vegetarian and meat spring rolls and most of his two scoops of rice were even consumed with little fuss and a comment of \"it tastes sweet\" (yep, coconut rice sure does and we had a good laugh!). As we had two more adults and a child join us, more dishes were ordered beyond what the two of us had requested. That's just how we roll when we see friends, invite them to join us at the table and that's how a good food sharing adventure starts. We were all happy with the 4 different dishes and of course the kid wasn't the only one enjoying spring rolls! I thought it was also really good of the restaurant to allow us to bring in the cake, let alone offer to light it up for us so we could sing happy birthday to our friend. What was a little off (and I do get adding people to our table after we just ordered can throw a waitress or apparently both of them off their game but we did ask if that would be ok) was the fact that we had to wait, then remind, ask again and then finally just grab plates and cutlery. Water was only refilled once and that was towards the end of the meal. The waitress taking the ongoing order seemed annoyed that our friends didn't magically have menus (again we asked but weren't given) and therefore didn't know what they wanted already. When menus were brought, it felt like the timing of her returning to get the order was really delayed. So when dropping the menus off or even taking the second order, it would have been a really good point to check with the table about using groupons before taking their order. We had already mentioned we had a groupon to use for the evening when we first sat down but the convo was never brought up again until we wanted to pay and we were told what we couldn't do. So be warned, only one groupon can be used per table even if there is two separate bills. As it was our friend's birthday, we let them use the groupon for their portion of the bill. I guess when I do go back to use my groupon (hopefully before it expires), I'll definitely make sure to remember that rule in case the off chance that scenario happens again. As I'm guilty for more the merrier, especially when in places where you can share food so easily.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Long time Tan and Beauty World customer here. Please don't go here for beauty services, it's not worth it. I've been going here since last summer to get my nails done, and go in every two weeks. They take a LONG time to do a set of acrylics, as in 2 hours. And be prepared to be charged for everything! You want French tip? $5 more. You want cuticles cut? $10 more. You want nails trimmed? $5 more. You want gel polish? $15 more. So, a set normally ran me around $65, which wouldn't be so bad if service was better. But they will literally start your nails, and take phone calls, go check the laundry mat next door, go do front desk tasks. In addition, there is only one nail tech who does nails well so I'd you don't get her, you're going to walk out with bumpy nails. Not pretty. The girls don't speak any English so communication is tough but they are quick to suggest that you should get other services done. If you say no to one thing, they will suggest another 4. Not the best sales technique but whatever works. I'm writing this review because I've tolerated a lot from this place in terms of taking super long, getting nails done poorly, and being provided bad service but the last time I went in there was awful. The owner, which is the only good nail tech, was out of town so her daughter began doing my nails. Walked in around 12:15pm and left around 2pm with nails that looked awful! The acrylic was layered on thick and was not smooth at all! In addition, the nails were not even the same shape so when the polish was put on, it made them look even worse! I could have done them better myself honestly. Did not have time to go in to fix them until a few days later, and when I finally had the time, I was completely blown off when I asked to get them fixed. So, in summary, there are many other places that will provide you with a better product and better service, don't waste your time going here. PS: Extreme Tan down the street has prices half that of this place in terms of tanning and friendlier faces!","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I wish I could fully describe how amazing my experience at Marie Gabriel Couture was. I chose Marie Gabriel because they are the only bridal salon in Indiana with Hayley Paige dresses- I love HP for her personal style, spunky personality and dresses that have a little sparkle, but not way too much sparkle. By the way- we brought our own bubbly and we were able to drink it throughout the fitting which was so fun!! Anyway, Maria was my stylist and she was absolutely wonderful. Prior to the appointment, I'd had my eye on a certain dress for months. I tried it on first and loved it. The second dress I tried on, both moms loved it and they loved it more than the first. I didn't hate it, but I wasn't sure about it- I tried on other dresses. Also, they provided heels to really give the \"full effect\" which was super nice! We later decided to put the first dress on again. Then we put the second dress on. Again, both moms still loved it, more than the first. Maria could tell I didn't love the second dress and in the NICEST most polite way, where the moms couldn't hear, told me she thought I was trying to make myself fall in love with the second dress because the moms liked it the best. Then, I put the first dress back on. By the way- the two dresses were different silhouettes and Maria was awesome at explaining how each would need to be altered for my body. After a few minutes of being back in the first dress, I began crying, that was the dress, that was the one. Maria was so right- I was definitely trying to make myself fall in love with the second dress because the moms loved it but it just wasn't the one for me. I'm so happy Maria made that one comment, she truly helped me in the best way possible throughout the entire appointment. At the end, the moms ended up deciding they loved the first dress the best and we purchased it!! Also, Maria helped me pick out earrings that matched the dress PERFECTLY which is a relief- one more thing happily crossed off my to-do list!! I can't urge you enough to visit Marie Gabriel Couture If you purchase a dress, I promise buying earrings there is so much easier because you can try them on while wearing the dress!!","stars":5.0}

When Dr. Berg saw me he did not greet me or say hello instead he said \"So you missed two appointments\" I apologized and tried to explain to him how crazy it had been at work and he interrupted me by roughly taking hold of my jaw and injecting the first dose of novocaine into my gum. When he injected the second dose of novocaine it felt like an electric shock in my jaw and I jolted in pain. I looked up at him and asked \"What was that?\" He rudely stated \" I guess I got to close to your nerve\" and walked out of the room. I had the strong feeling that it was not a mistake that he was to close to my nerve. I began to cry and one of the kind dental assistants gave me some kleenex.

I did end up going home because of their total unwillingness to help or listen to me, and after two days of wearing my glasses and horrible headaches I called, and again said...this is the wrong prescription. Dr. Weisman then had the nerve to place the blame me for the mistake by stating that he can only figure out my prescription from what I tell him during the eye exam. Finally I had glasses and contacts that worked after several unnecessary appointments later to remedy their mistakes on both my glasses and contacts.

{"text":"I visited the new Trader Joe's a week after the grand opening and found it to be way less crowded than anticipated. I went around 9 am on a Saturday and around noon on a Friday. According to staff, mornings are the best time to go to avoid the crowds. TJs is much smaller than a typical grocery store, so don't come here expecting an abundance of variety. Rather, you will mostly find unique Trader Joe's brand items that you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere at these prices. Tons of organic and natural products, as well as a solid selection of gluten free items. I find that the funnest part of Trader Joes is discovering new products every time you go as well as swapping recommendations with other TJs shoppers. Some of my favorite items include: - Cookie butter (and cookie butter swirl -- which is mixed with trader joes take on Nutella!) - edamame hummus - blue cheese pecan dip - spinach and kale Greek yogurt dip - peanut butter pretzels - any of their chocolate covered nuts - balsamic glaze - quinoa and black bean tortilla chips - roasted coconut chips - chocolate covered potato chips (sinful!) - frozen mango - Shredded Brussels sprouts - raw almond butter (much cheaper than anywhere else) - frozen falafel - frozen chile rellenos - vanilla coconut milk (boxed in refrigerated section) - light coconut milk (canned) They have an awesome cheese section and it's hard not to buy all of it. You can find great deals on nuts, dried fruit, and their frozen entrees. Flowers are really cheap too. Beware of the amazing chocolates they strategically place at the check outs! The cookie butter dark chocolate bar is out of this world. Staff is super friendly and proud of the brand and the products. Both times I've visited they tipped me off to some of their favorite items. Downside: Yes, parking sucks. The store layout is a little tight but shoppers seemed to do a good job navigating the aisles in an orderly fashion.","stars":5.0}

Being in the service industry myself, I tend to have a higher expectation. From the moment we walked in the door, my fiance and I loved it. The ambiance was warm and welcoming. The staff was awesome, starting with the hostess. We ordered the Smoked Old Fashioned because a fellow foodie suggested it to start with. The best I've ever had. They actually light up the cedar plank to smoke the glass right there. Even the ice cube was cool! Aside from a unique food and drink menu, what set this place apart was the manager, Tyler. We were just sitting out on the front patio enjoying our drinks and having their delicious bread pudding when he came out to check on us. While he was extremely professional, it felt like we were talking to an old friend. He clearly loves what he does, and that's something that is refreshing to behold. He was excited about the food and drinks and made some great suggestions after asking what kind of stuff we liked. We will be returning for sure, and telling everyone we know about this treasure.

It may seem intimidating at first to buy a simple bottle of wine from such a comprehensive selection, but general descriptions for the staff can lead you in the right direction. I never thought that I would have favorite wines - they all used to taste the same to me! - and my palate is not as refined as many of my elite Yelpers, but because of their selection and the helpfulness of the staff, I now have these (inexpensive) favorites which I constantly re-order on a biweekly basis: Cab sav: Vistamir Brisa (almost always sold out); Double Dog Dare (incredibly inexpensive, \"safe\" cab sav choice) Red blends: Il Duca Imperiale Red (semi-sweet; probably too sweet for the average wine drinker) White zin: Canyon Oaks; Double Dog Dare (again, incredibly inexpensive but very drinkable) My only complaint is because of the only returns experience (10\/6\/2018) that my girlfriend had. I don't remember the manager, and I can't provide much context, but from what I've heard, the manager was questioning the returns process a little too much, even though they are supposed to have a no-hassle returns policy for wine. It made her uncomfortable, and it was a more irritating process than it needed to be. They have a decent rewards program and will occasionally send you coupons.

{"text":"Portobello is an exceptional and cozy restaurant, that deserves top marks for both food and service. They were able to accommodate our reservation for four, made earlier that day. As the name would suggest, many dishes draw on the mushrooms for which this region is renowned. I started with the crepe. It was both filled and topped with several species of mushrooms, in a savory sauce. My main was destined to be the crispy duck. They serve you half of the bird, the flesh rich and meaty, the skin crunching audibly with each bite. (The chef revealed that the secrets to achieving this effect on the skin are drawn from Chinese cuisine, even though the preparation is French.) Around half the surface of the duck is coated in cherry sauce, and rests on a bed of rice. I also had the opportunity to taste the steak with mushrooms and the beef stroganoff. (They were both excellent.) For dessert we had the salted caramel toffee cake. Absolutely delicious. The staff were all friendly, attentive and yet unobtrusive.

{"text":"The rundown: -Cakes\/cupcakes: Heavy, somewhat dry, and a bit bland. Icing is almost always horrible, some tasting like straight up Crisco; notably: the chocolate dipped, the blue rainbow with the clouds on top, and their cookies & cream cupcakes. -Doughnuts: Their stuffed doughnuts are a bit of a letdown. The stuffed birthday cake doughnut was like biting into a soggy doughnut that was drenched in royal icing. The concept is neat, but execution just falls flat. Some other doughnuts have a filling or topping of some sort that just tastes rancid. Their pumpkin doughnut is the best pumpkin doughnut I've ever had. -Cheesecakes: Their cheesecakes are mostly meh. Not amazing, nothing to write home about, but not bad. Their Butterfinger cheesecake is pretty win, though. -Brownies: Here's where they start getting awesome. They have a salted caramel brownie that's just that right amount of gooey in the middle. The frosting is a perfect addition to top it all off. The smores ('campfire') brownies are another favorite. Really well done with a graham cracker crust underneath a perfectly baked brownie and a lightly-toasted, perfectly gooey marshmallow topping. Just go get one already. -Lattes: They have some interesting flavors. However, I've cut myself off from ordering any more. They've been mostly fail. When Dough is a cheat day go-to, I prefer the calories to be delicious so that when I'm trying to sweat off those calories later on, I can be like \"It was worth it and I regret nothing. Nothing!\" -Popcorn: If you see a bag for sale, buy it. My husband is in love with their sriracha cheddar popcorn, and their strawberry popcorn is crack in a bag. -Chocolates\/fudge\/etc.: Not bad. They have some fudge around the holidays that is delightful. Aside from that, it's mostly just overpriced, pretty desserts.You can call it 'artisan' all you want, but tastes like mass produced crap. You'd find better fudge at a bake sale. -Bastardized doughnut ice cream cone monstrosities: I don't really have any interest in trying them. Judging from other reviews, the doughnut cone is heavy and bland (see a pattern here?) and the majority of their 'flavor of the week' seems to be quantity over quality. I would love if they spent a bit more time thinking out the flavor of the week, rather than 'what semi-related crap can we throw on top of this glob of ice cream\/gelato that is shoved into this overly-dense doughnut?' The size is also a bit ridiculous. I wouldn't even be able to plow through half of that before I started hating myself and feel like I would explode. Bit of a waste, really. Even their recent 'great pumpkin patch' concoction didn't sound appealing at all; and this is coming from someone who is pro-pumpkin errthang. The employees here are typically really nice and more than helpful even when they're completely slammed. To whoever films their stuff for social media: please stop.

{"text":"Booo. What a complete and utter disappointment. I bought a $4k bike from this shop. They were great at the sales end. 2 rides later I discovered a manufacturer defect w the bolts in the fork and I couldn't attach any gear to the braze-ons. I had a bikepack planned (months in the planning) but it was more than a month out so I wasn't worried. I brought my bike in and was assured by the owner that they would warranty the fork if needed. A few weeks later they told me to come get my bike - they were waiting on bolts from Niner. I still wasn't concerned. I never heard back from CS so I started calling (4-5x over a several week period of time). Mechanic said the bolts were on their way. On another call I spoke with a woman who was completely unprofessional and unhelpful. She told me to call Niner myself and said they only call their rep and they hadn't heard from him. She said she'd call me back and never did. I called again and spoke to her. She said the owner would try to get bolts elsewhere. She said they would call me back. It'a been 2 weeks - crickets. They knew I needed it fixed by 4\/1. They NEVER FOLLOWED UP. I took it to Fairwheel and they fixed it within 2 days. They spoke to Niner and confirmed it would be under warranty if needed. FW got bolts from a machine shop and I had to pay $40 to overnight the bolts if I wanted it completed before my trip. Obviously I paid it. My friends now know about this experience and will never shop at CS. One friend is cancelling her Niner order w them. I will literally drive to Phx to avoid this shop. Never in my life have I experienced such terrible customer service. Word travels CS. Lesson learned for me - I should have listened to others who told me never to shop at CS.","stars":1.0}

Insider tip, make your next reservation before you leave so you have something to look forward to!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Fun spot. The place was packed this Saturday, so we waited at the bar while a table opened up. Our drinks were decent, obviously not expertly craft cocktails but enjoyable. The guacamole was excellent. The carnitas tacos and plantains were quite good as well. However, the menu is overall underwhelming as the only entree options are really tacos and enchiladas. And the music was incredibly loud so my friend and I spent most of our dinner shouting and\/or repeating everything we said. Overall worth checking out but not recommended for date night or intimate conversation.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for this place about a year ago, when they were in downtown SB and we were making a trip there, so I looked around for groupons that looked good, as I do. We got there and they were closed for the move out to the 'burbs, which was kind of irritating that they didn't give us advance warning, but I'm happy to report, having made another trip back out that way last weekend, that they were 100% willing to honor our groupon even though it expired several months ago, or this would have been a less good review. That said: this is quite possibly the best olive oil and vinegar I've tasted. I've so far gone similar fancy olive oil and vinegar tastings in Santa Cruz, Temecula, Newport Beach and Washington DC, and while they've all been excellent, this place is the winner for most of the flavors we tried that they have competition in - the only one I thought was kind of lackluster was the lemon (it was still great, it was just a bit too subtle). Of particular note: * Their peach vinegar tasted like a dessert - literally, you could just put it in a little dessert wine glass, and sip it, nothing else required. * They make a \"butter\" flavored olive oil, that literally does taste very much like that super-unhealthy liquid butter like you get at a movie theater, but is apparently flavored from some plant, and is completely dairy-free and as healthy as olive oil. That is way cool. * They make a chili-flavored olive oil from some African pepper - it has the heat and the smokiness of your standard chipotle olive oil, but so much more flavor. It is super amazingly good (if you like spicy olive oil, which I do). They are also happy to mix sampler-size bottles of any of the olive oils\/vinegars they sell, which is way more useful and a very good idea for them (some of the places we've been, already prepackaged their sampler sets and only sell specific sets). 6 sampler bottles of your choice for $32 (without a Groupon) is pricey, but totally not *unreasonably* pricey given the quality. I am so looking forward to enjoying the items we purchased, and have to say, the Groupon actually really did feel like we got a deal (sometimes with places like this, it feels like they overprice everything and then run Groupons to give people the \"real\" price but make it *seem* like they're giving you a deal. This felt like their regular price was actually the regular price, and like we actually did get a deal. :))","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Nice try. You are trying to use the ADA to try to excuse an inappropriately permissive informal policy toward dogs in your restaurant. This was not a service animal. The patron was not disabled in any way. You may not be allowed to ask more than those 2 questions of customers with animals, but neither the ADA nor the Tennessee Public Accommodations law requires you to allow a large dog to be carried above the table surfaces of other customers. The ADA also requires: \"The service animal must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered while in public places unless these devices interfere with the service animal's work or the person's disability prevents use of these devices.\" This dog was not on any leash, was not performing any task, and the customer in question was an affluently dressed, able bodied young man. He carried the dog in his arms; he could hold a leash. Finally, so-called \"emotional support animals\" are not service animals at all under either the federal ADA or the Tennessee Public Accommodations law (which in fact only recognizes \"guide dogs\" that assist people with clear physical disabilities). If you are going to try to use the law to excuse your unsanitary policies, at least know the law. Next thing you know, you'll be claiming that the ADA and Tennessee laws prohibit your restaurant managers from making enough gravy.","stars":1.0}

We hadn't been to the Continental in several years and thought it would be a fun place to take our out-of-town friends. On a good note, the staff is friendly and fairly efficient. However, the restaurant gets very loud, and the $17 GG martini was the smallest I've ever had. Seriously - I've never seen a martini glass that small! I strongly suggest sitting at the upstairs bar, as well as dining upstairs, if you want to carry on any type of conversation.The food was just ok. Overpriced for what you get. And again, just ok.

{"text":"Ok so, I love \"real\" banana flavored milkshakes. In my quest, I tried PDQ's seasonal Banana Pudding shake. Nope, not the one. It was more like a Vanilla Wafer shake w\/a hint of banana. So, the search continued. Last night, I tried Sonic's Fresh Banana milkshake (again) and it was AMAZING! A liberal amount of \"ripe\" (not green) bananas carefully blended w\/ice cream (or base). Result? An amazing 1200 calories of bliss! If I'm going to \"fall off\", it needs to be RIGHT! In general, most restaurants battle consistency issues. Sonic is no different. So, don't expect nirvana on every visit. Let's be realistic. That being said, this location (Balm Riverview) is the most consistent...for a QUALITY banana milkshake. Due to past quality issues, I avoid other Sonics in the area (Big Bend, and Valrico on 60). Lastly, KUDOS!...to the employee who put so much love into my diet busting banana shake (Thu 4\/12\/18 @ 9:53 pm). SONIC: Please ensure all staff learn and follow \"that\" process.","stars":5.0}

The place is a serious hole-in-the-wall but so worth it. We were greeted when we walked in by a really nice lady behind the counter. She asked how we'd heard about the place & was genuinely happy we'd come in. Great start! We ordered a leg quarter and a breast, and after much persuasion from the people working there, we went with 100 degrees. Not really that spicy at all but still very very good. We doctored it up with some hot sauce, and we know next time to at least go for the 200. They make it fresh when you walk in the door & order so if you call ahead it can be ready for you. Us first-timers know that now for next time! It was a very small eating area, maybe enough for 6 people, but we ended up eating there anyway. We had the fries & slaw as our sides which were nothing crazy but still good. Overall I'd have to say our experience was great. We will certainly go back again when we get the hankerin' for some hot chicken (and we will call ahead too!). By the way, THEY DO NOT TAKE CARDS. You either need cash or check.","stars":5.0}

What kept me going there was their kindness (though it may have been fake looking back) and great deals for oil changes. But recent events have changed me feelings. The other day I took my car in for an oil change and when completed, they notified me that there were other things that needed to be taken care of asap. I was told that all of my brakes and rotors would need replaced and that it would cost me a whopping $544. Really? REALLY?! Yeah, no. I'm thinking I was the girl that they were going to take advantage of that day. Obviously I'm not inspecting the underpart of my car every day, so how was I supposed to know if my brakes and rotors actually needed replaced? I do the next thing any daughter does that isn't a pro with cars. I call my dad. He sets up an appointment with a car place in our hometown. The owner is someone we have known for awhile, so we trusted his verdict -- which was that there was absolutely nothing wrong with my brakes and rotors.

Georgia Dog - delicious! Peaches come warm on top. Secret sauwce is yum! Big Daddy Dog - very good! Pickles were a nice touch! Daddy's Drank - came in the fun baggie. It was cute.

{"text":"There is a new term in town and it's 'I've been Brauhaused.\" Being Brauhaused is the feeling you get after downing two liters of beer and eating copious amounts of sausage, it's akin to the Thanksgiving experience without getting sleepy. Happiness. The location on South Street would not have been my first choice but I can ignore the kids long enough to escape inside. A fresh oasis, clean, bright, blonde woods and cool air, you can completely forget the grime and noise of South Street inside Brauhaus Schmitz. I cannot say that I've extensively explored the menu, since this was my first visit. However I stuck to the 'house specials' so that I could get a feeling of how Brauhaus wished to present itself. This is the only place in town that serves beer by the Liter, inside the kind of mugs you see on TV from Oktoberfest. There are plenty of German brews for the officianoto but to be honest I'm here for the gimmick, the full on German experience. I can get fancy beer anywhere in the city, but I can only get a mug big enough to knock out a water bison at Brauhaus. Asking the bartender for his opinion he suggested the 'house beer', which was sufficiently tasty while remaining very light so that it did not weigh me down or overwhelm, as so many modern microbrews tend to do. If you're looking for the type of people who enjoy proclaiming their German heritage and expounding upon their many trips to the Fatherland, you'll find no shortage of this type of patron. As annoying as these types of unwanted ambassadors are, they do have a few good suggestions on the food. I was introduced to small snacking sausages you can buy for a $1 a piece while you wait for you food or just to sip with your beer. It's not on the menu, but they are Yummy! The first food ordered was the Gulaschsuppe, which is a beef stew with potatoes. When I asked for this I was immediately informed that there was fresh spatzel available to add to the stew, not being one to pass up an opportunity I dived right in. Now my only complaint I have here is that this stew is a $7 item on the menu however this order morphed into a $15 massive bowl of stew and spatzel, with EXTRA spatzel on the side in case there was not enough. I ate it all without complaint. The beef melts in the mouth, the broth was rich with mellow spice and beef juices, perfectly cooked potatoes, the spatzel was so wonderful I even ate the extra. I will order this again and again and again. Hearty and delicious, a full meal. Which made me regret ordering the 'house special' sausage, previously to ordering the stew. I was only able to eat a small amount of the meter long, Hausgemachte N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst (something like two pounds of meat), but it was also very good. Very fine grinding so that there are no grisly","stars":5.0}
{"text":"This was my first time shopping at this meijer. We normally shop the one in Camby, but since we had our grocery list with us on our way home from running other errands, we passed this meijer and decided to stop in since we were already here. Plenty of parking, so we grabbed a space fairly close to one of the entrances and appreciated that the rows for parking had letters to help us remember which row we had chosen. One thing that is weird is that meijer stores are not set up identically, so from my perspective, we had to figure out where everything was. We would have probably shopped faster driving on to our local store and just picking up what we needed. I'm a bit of a speed shopper because I know my own store layout so well. Trying a new one is always a bit frustrating. I wonder why they don't lay out the stores which are usually built from the ground up the same? Not that this store is to blame, it is more of a complaint about meijer in general. The store is huge and they do have a lot of items to choose from. I also like that there seemed to generally be wide enough aisles for people to pass with carts. There were shortages on some holiday items and paper products probably due to the hoarding mentality that has taken hold of our nation. You can't even mention snowfall without stores noticeably being depleted. I was looking for a canned good for Thanksgiving and the store had it set up on the bottom row. Unfortunately, the rows are deep and from a standing postition, it was hard to read the label for the items which were shoved so deeply into the row that the labels on the cans were not readable. I literally had to get down on my knees to read the small print and then look through the row to see the canned goods lined up single file at the back of the shelf. Good thing I am still flexible and have long arms. I don't know how many people would go to my effort to get what they needed. So, someone on the staff should be bringing the items forward for the customers, especially in the areas where obvious attrition was occurring. Maybe they could check in the back to see if there were any more inventory in stock to help shoppers. I can't have been the only shopper frustrated that it was difficult to find common items in the store. I also noticed that the shelves seemed high and that made it difficult to read some of the aisle signs. My wife was looking to find the pharmacy and it took awhile to spot it. She didn't say whether she found the item she was looking for or not. I understand these aren't ideal times for first visits to stores, so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt with a 4 star rating. But customers will only put","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This is in one of those plazas that you just drive by but never go into. The interior is small with a brick wall and brown floors\/silver metal chairs. It's clean but looks a little dark,flat, and unappealing. I went for a lunch since it was barely 3 miles from the house. There are 2 lunch specials depending on toppings\/pizza slice. one for 6.25 and one for 7.50.Both include a fountain soda. Now there were 2 pizzas on racks , a Sicilian cheese, and a thin white\/spinach pie. I ordered the Sicilian (2 slices) and asked if there was pepperoni on it since I couldn't get a close look. He said yes. However, when it came time to pay , my order was $9 bucks. Apparently he thought I asked if i wanted to ADD pepperoni to it which upped the price $1.5 Also it was a bit annoying that the tip option is asked before you complete the transaction on the card reader. Usually most businesses complete the main transaction FIRST, then the tip or ask you to write the tip on the receipt. They give you a plastic cup for the fountain drink and the machine is a Coke centric one. Nothing else to write home. The pizza was decent, but not a revelation.The crust tastes different than many other places. In fact, since I had Jet's sicilian pepperoni just a few weeks ago, I think I like theirs better. Blasphemy, I know to like a chain place over indie , but oh well. Plus, Jets was $5 for exact same meal basically. They should just make the lunch special one uniform price ($8) instead of doing upgrades imo. Overall: Ok, but not a place I'd run back to soon","stars":3.0}

To make it worse the cab driver was smoking, driving without his seatbelt, had the emergency break on the entire ride, the meter didn't work, and we generally felt unsafe with his driving.

We were left for long periods of time sitting and not one of our dinner plates were cleared from the table after an eternity in restaurant time. Our last drinks were never delivered, although our bill was presented and paid. We had to flag a busser to get our drinks to go even after reminding our server not to forget our drinks when we paid our check. Food was mediocre. Gumbo, red beans and rice, onion rings, and blackened redfish were good. Grilled oysters tasted like gas from the grill and had too much cheese. Shrimp and grits were the worst I've ever had. It was a plate w\/ one half unseasoned\/unsalted grits that had a few shreds of cheese, and the other half with shrimp and sauce. Sauce was ok, but I was appalled that the grits were completely unseasoned. It was a joke compared to the southern shrimp and grits I've had previously.

He was friendly and offered to wipe down a table outside for us (it had just rained) which was great. I think some of the draw to this place is being able to sit outside. I tried the salmon quiche and my partner had the pain au Chocolat. Both were very good. I loved how they came and brought them out to us! So friendly and accommodating! After we sat down there were a lot of people trickling in to sit on the lawn, which I found very endearing. My only issue was that I got a chai latte and it just tasted like milk.

Fries were crispy on the outside and tasted delicious. Overall a pleasant experience! The only reason this place is getting 4 star is due to the price of the food.

{"text":"OK, so were trying to find a new \"favorite\" sushi place. Sushi Saga (Siena Hotel) closes June 30th. Looks like the hotel is going to be a Marriott Rennasiance -- no casino. Initially the staff thought there would still be a sushi restaurant but now know they are out of work on June 30. To bad... great restaurant... great staff. So we've been to Sushi Sake before (Eldorado Casino). The sushi is pretty good. The service tonight - no so great. Maybe its because we were \"at home\" at Sushi Saga and they treated us right. Tonight we seemed to be sitting in no man's land -- sushi chef to left and sushi chef to right. We were only the second group to arrive - so sushi chef to the right came over to take our order. Soon 4 men came in and sat by chef to the right and we were abandoned. Sushi chef from the left finally came over and finished our order and was again attentative since he had no other customers in front of him. Listen up wait staff -- most women are better tippers -- unless they feel snubbed or abandoned as we did tonight. Don't get me wrong the sushi was good. Except maybe the gyoza .. really!!! deep fried and huge as dumplings ... gyoza is usually with a thinner dough and only lightly fried or steamed. We'll give it another try but not sure it can be a favorite. Feel like I'm eating in a hallway and the music from Roxy's bar is extremely loud.","stars":3.0}

I had bitten the piece off and was mid chew when I looked down to see an almost completely raw piece of chicken on my plate. It could not have been cooked for more than 10 minutes...I was disgusted and spit the chicken out and had ordered a broken rice dish instead. The broken rice was lukewarm and it oddly came out in about 5 minutes. However I just sort of sat there and thought to myself how terrible the food has become. Barely any flavor and the food wasn't even piping hot. What used to be my favorite Vietnamese restaurant had quickly became one of the worst. I'm sad to be giving what used to be a 5 stars in my eyes to a quick 1 star rating...maybe it's a change of management or a different chef...","stars":1.0}

There are two dog enclosures, one for small dogs. I don't have a dog, but it makes for distracting dog\/owner-watching as you walk the track. It is bounded on two sides by an enormous Oleander hedge, and on a third side by an open lot that dips to a wash with a lovely bridge linking it to the neighborhood and further, to a cross-walk on Kolb.

{"text":"AVOID THEIR SPA AT ALL COSTS! I had purchased a spa experience at Goodland for my mom's 60th birthday. For starters, when we showed up, there was a loud DJ party going on by the pool just outside the spa, so the loud music didn't create a relaxing environment with all the noise thumping through the walls. As for my experience, I had ordered the hot stone massage, but the masseuse forgot to use the stones. Additionally, he couldn't get his music to come on to cover the loud music outside because of connectivity issues. He was futzing with his phone for 15 minutes, and then cut that time out of my 50 minute spa experience. It also made us both feel stressed out because it was frustrating. Plus, I was lying there naked while he was trying to figure it out, which adds an additional layer of awkward. As for my mom's experience, her masseuse talked incessantly about her own health problems during my mom's entire treatment. Usually one expects a quiet and relaxing experience during a massage, not to be bombarded with someone's issues. Plus, who talks during a massage?? I've never had a masseuse do that? My mom felt really awkward because she didn't want to be impolite by telling her to be quiet, so she just laid there hoping she would stop eventually, but she didn't. I could even hear the woman talking from my treatment room next door. Afterward, I called the hotel and corresponded with a manager named Mindy who promised to \"make me happy.\" I said I wanted a refund. She said she'd look into it, but also denied responsibility for what happened stating, \"the spa is outsourced so it isn't part of the hotel.\" It has the hotel's brand name on it, so why wouldn't you own for that? If someone made me an awful sandwich at Subway, would Subway be like, \"Oh yeah, that's not Subway's fault - that guy just works here?\" I called and left several messages for the manager afterward, but she was mysteriously unavailable every time I called and would never call me back. The one time I did get a hold of her, she said she spoke with the spa people and that she would get back to me. She never did. I felt really embarrassed because this was my mom's 60th birthday. She has had a really hard year and I wanted to make her feel special. I had raved to her about how great the Goodland Hotel was, but boy did I look like an idiot when this happened. I'm still not happy.","stars":1.0}

So now that Steve is gone and we hope he finds the help he needs let's support Richard by continuing to have our auto's repaired by the actual person behind the curtain. Richard, we all wish you all the luck you need with your new business and will continue bringing our cars to you for expert repair at a fair price.

{"text":"I am giving a one star review because \"no stars\" is not available. I was drawn to the Bistro because I had been a fan of Zanzibar Blue. I am a foodie, a jazz lover and a lover of Paris. When friends offered to take me out for my birthday I suggested we dine there and hear some music. My friends were told that there were no reservations for the music venue but if we showed up an hour early we would have no trouble being seated there...in other words, first come first serve. We checked our reservations and double checked their policy for seating for music, so we all arrived looking forward to a wonderful dining and listening experience. We went over our preferences with hostess and, to our surprise, we were seated upstairs near the front window. When we said we wanted to sit downstairs, it was explained to us that we would dine upstairs and be seated downstairs later. This made no sense to us but we were reassured that this was how it worked. So, we ordered our God and became concerned when, 20 minutes before showtime, we hadn't finished our dinner (mediocre for all four of us) and hadn't been approached about our promised transition downstairs. I asked the waiter about this and 10 minutes later a woman in charge of seating came to tell us that we had gone about it all wrong. We should have been seated downstairs. I explained that their employee had seated us after we had explained quite clearly our preferences. She showed no sympathy for our plight and took no responsibility for creating it. After listing to her repeat, like a recording her nonexplantion, she concluded with, \"Others were ahead of you\" which was callous and unsatisfactory. Obviously, I'll take my business elsewhere. Who needs abusive treatment and overpriced mediocre food?","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Meh. I ordered the beef salad, clear noodle salad, and the \"dirty noodles\". I've frequented a *lot* of Thai establishments and this one is... different, to say the least. I'd like to say that maybe it was a fluke, but it's hard to say it's a fluke when 3 out of 3 dishes that were not too impressive at a supposedly 4-star establishment. - The beef salad was heavy on the salad and quite light on the beef. Not really the style of beef salad that I'm more used to at more traditional Thai mom-and-pop establishments - heavier on the beef, light on the salad. The salad is honestly just supposed to be almost like a condiment, as it's commonly eaten with rice. The beef was cut rather thick and in large pieces, compared to traditionally smaller, almost minced sized, but the sauce was good albeit missing a certain oomph. - The clear noodle salad was lacking in flavor, in my opinion. I ended up using some of the leftover sauce from the beef salad to zhuzh it up, but the serving size was about twice the size of the beef salad and wasn't enough to make it entirely palatable. Again, not the flavor that I'm used to for clear noodle salads. - The \"dirty noodles\" didn't have much flavor either, oddly? The first couple of seconds start off well, but then the sauce just loses itself quickly after and you're left feeling like you're just chewing on something just to make sure you can swallow it safely. Maybe they needed to put more sauce? The noodles definitely did not absorb the sauce and was just kinda coating it. Same with the broccoli. The sauce lightly coats the outside a bit but doesn't penetrate inside of it at all and you can clearly taste the plain broccoli flavor in the middle. Side note: I called to place an order for pickup and was not given a total amount nor was i told how long it should take for the order to be ready.","stars":2.0}

True, you can't deny that Jason's is a typical sandwich shop but how many sandwich shops do you know that serve FREE soft serve ice cream (cone or cup) in addition to a full salad and dessert bar? For these green eyes, not many! The interior is reminiscent of a diner\/cafe hybrid. You grab a menu, wait your turn in line to order, then wait patiently at your choice of table or vinyl black booth with a little red number flying high in order for your food to make it to its final destination. Your stomach. The prices are reasonable and the options for customization are endless. I typically order a Mediterranean Wrap (~$6) or the pulled pork BBQ sandwich (~$7). Both are excellent and try the potato salad as your side.

I do attribute this to there ever only being 2 servers and a bartender at most it seems like. I work in the industry so I can relate with having too many tables at once and still trying doing your best. The service isn't bad, just slow. I'm sure since it's just a small neighborhood grill that staffing one more person may simply not be an option. Even with this minor complaint it would never stop me from going in.

{"text":"Great for brunch! I have not eaten in-house yet but recently ordered takeout for pickup. I don't understand the negative rating, as everything was delicious and fresh. The freshly squeezed orange juice is particularly awesome. As far as the person complaining about the olive oil\/canola oil issue, it's been a trendy new thing for people to consider the supposedly quality of a cooking oil in lieu of it's smoke point. Heated past its smoke point, fat in food starts to break down, releasing free radicals and a substance called acrolein, the chemical that gives burnt foods their acrid flavor and aroma. Technically, olive oil is healthier for items such as salads and sauces, but for sausages or fried potatoes, it is actually BETTER to use canola oil. The best and most recommended healthy oil for cooking is of course, avocado oil, which is healthier like olive oil, but unlike coconut and olive oil which both turn into a carcinogen when used for cooking, avocado oil has a smoke point of up to 500 degrees. Please do your research before throwing local businesses under the bus :)","stars":4.0}

I am not very picky and I know everyone makes mistakes so my thumb that is on an angle that she offered to fix I brushed off. When she was done I was satisfied & paid my bill.

{"text":"Live music in this city is so badly needed. Long after grape street was forced to downsize, and Khyber and Triumph both went out of that sort of business, there are few viable options left and I am still hopeful that the landscape will innovate or at least maintain. It would be excellent to see this place make its own name despite where it is right now. The $20 minimum for credit and guaranteed 20% gratuity may be a slight turnoff to people who like to feel generously if and when buying big meals and tipping 20% or more. Some bar folk just want to have fries and a coke now and again because they already had a meal. These food\/drink minimums would make sense at a crowded, hip scene to make room for paying dinner customers. However, I get easily disgusted by places that have to make up standards like this without inforcing them with a little more effort and class, like why not let the food dictate who buys it and in what quantity? As for the food, it was nothing unexpected for a place that enforces such minimum buys in order to cover fees. This tells me they either forsee a problem with split checks that may be discouraged, or that they have no confidemce anyone could want to buy the fopd if not for a little incemtive. If it were all good enough, I wouldn't need any unwelcome pressures to double up on my appetizer orders, or maybe even ask a few friends to sit with me under the drippy dark wooden roof and run up a tab as we listen to occasional open mic talent, and back bar talk that seeks to drown it out, rather than to respect it for whatever merits it was brought in for, if none other than it maybe being available for cheap, and a good outlet for getting in new customers to try a place they have never heard of because its food has no reputation of its own. In fact, the manager on duty was the one making the most noise because she had brought her own friends in and tended to them and texting on her phone primarily, instead of summary duties tending the bar and supervising. It was unclear whether she was texting for work or home but either way her focus wasn't in comllete customer satisfaction. She also seemed aloof and disappeared much, leaving a food runner to pour drinks and ring tabs, despite appearing to lack familiarity with the system. Still, I like the concept of a Philly amateur music scene and as this one has two floors, dedicated to the music, I won't root against it. I just wish the food and service could be more of an attraction here, for those who are paying a full price, 20% gratuity and all. Restauranteurs must understand that a dessert menu, coffee, entree or drink specials, bottles, and appetizers are what drives volume. Not headcounts and minimum spends. 2.5 stars... could get 3 from me if they","stars":2.0}

They have a good selection of draught beer, including Phillip's Electric Unicorn IPA, although I would love to have seen some Alberta microbrews. They also have a variety of mules, and blended drinks, my daughter enjoyed their bellini. We were there for a quick bite, so focused on the appetizers, and selected some mango chipotle wings, onion ring tower, and poutine. They were all good, plump wings were a nice bonus, but could have used a few more onion rings for $8.50. We wanted a little more, so we tried the pepperoni bacon flatbread, which was fine, could have been crisper, and the soup of the day, a take on jambalaya, which was okay but not stellar.

I stopped by yesterday for take-out. Thought I wanted one thing but let the super-duper nice girl at the register convince me to try something else. WOW. Correct choice! I was blown away by the Chaufa w. beef. Although described as fried rice (I also got an order of tostones - fried green plantains) like the other reviewer I was impressed that nothing was greasy. My favorite part of the Caufa was this zippy sauce\/onion mixture (onion, lime, cilantro) that seriously took the dish to another level. It was spicy, it was tangy, but it was refreshing at the same time. Portions are very generous and prices are reasonable. For $18 I got enough food for two adults (with leftovers). The place looks like a diner. Tile floor, a few booths, a few tables, a huge TV. The food is made to order - so it took a while, maybe 20 minutes for it to come out - TOTALLY fine with me. It's also a BYO which I can't wait to go back with a few cold beers and try out everything on the menu. Oh, and they specialize in ceviche.

Looks like this particular location has its set of regulars, and the workers had a pretty organized system of calling out orders as they came out. My friends decided to share their shrimp St. Paul sandwich, while I opted for their veggie St. Paul sandwich instead. Upon receiving our orders, we noticed that our sandwiches had come with little packets of chili powder, which did help with the taste a bit, but I think hot sauce would've been a better choice. The sandwiches tasted like how we would imagine, though: greasy and bland. What an odd concept. I guess if you're looking to try out a St. Paul sandwich, or if you happen to be in the move for take out Chinese food, this isn't a bad place to go. As you would expect also, prices are pretty cheap here, and the portion sizes do look generous. 2.5 stars, but I am rounding up as the place itself was nice enough.","stars":3.0}

Second time I called in for delivery and the third time I placed an order on GrubHub for delivery. Just for the record, my family and I order basically the same thing every time. Being allergic to ginger, I always request no wasabi or ginger in the container with the sushi as well as brown rice in place of white rice. First time everything was great! No mistakes, food was delicious! So obviously we would order again at some point. Second time, I requested a large side of sweet and sour sauce and they sent me a large container of duck sauce. Also did not add the cream cheese I requested in the avocado roll, however charged me for said cream cheese. Even though I had the employee read back my order, they still were able to screw it up. Third time, (today) even after providing extensive instructions on GrubHub, they still managed to mess up our order. As always, I requested there not be ginger or wasabi in the container with the sushi. I also called to be sure they understood. Had the employee repeat the order back to me to be sure. Over an hour later the food arrived. This time with a ridiculous amount of wasabi and ginger in the sushi container. I called them immediately, spoke with a female employee, explained I could not eat the sushi because of the ginger touching more than half of the rolls. They apologized and told me they would bring new asap. Unfortunately I had to pick my daughter up from school early, therefore when the delivery driver arrived I was not home. He then called my phone, I asked him to just leave the new sushi in our mailbox (very weird request I know). The driver said something I did not understand so I asked him what he brought back. He said he brought more wasabi and ginger. At this point I am beyond frustrated. I told the man I didn't want it, and not to leave it there. Needless to say, we will not be ordering from there ever again. In my opinion, they should work on their communication skills to avoid this happening to other customers.","stars":2.0}

They were out of my favorite snack and when I asked if they'd br getting more in, they ordered some on the spot, I was able to grab them only two days later!! 10\/10, I will always recommend. If you're debating going, GO!! You will absolutely not regret your decision!! I love being able to support a small local shop and I love the service that's provided in return!!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Not happy with Axelrad at all. I see in Google he has a number of 5 stars reviews from every customer on Google which is impossible. I personally think that is incorrect. I used Axelrad 4 years ago and yes he does give a detailed report but in my opinion his staff only looks for the obvious. The one most obvious he missed. I have a Clay Shingle Roof and I am now finding out I have a number of broken tiles though out the roof. Five leaks in different areas of the roof, possibly more and I specifically recall his staff saying the roof was in \"PERFECT CONDITION \". \"THE BEST ROOF YOU CAN HAVE. WILL LAST FOREVER!\" Well, a Professional Roofer has just informed me that the Roofing Paper under the Clay Tiles is the cheapest paper you can use and one are more areas of the roof are completely worn with the plywood exposed. Now I am anticipating taking off all the weak roofing paper to update the roof with a better grade of roofing paper. Since he is one of few Home Inspectors in this field he is well know by many Real Estate Agents so in my opinion he is helping them make the sale. If you can afford to, get an Inspection from a Roofer, Pumper, Electrician and Foundation Inspection to be safe or the area that you think will be the most costly in repairs. What he will give you on paper is not completely valid and will not save you a lot of money and headache in the future. TAKE THIS REVIEW SERIOUS, PLEASE!!!!!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I found the perfect apartment. Now I had to figure out how to move all my things there. Yikes! Jessica C. referred me to Shawn and his crew, Lakeview Movers. Whew. Shawn was great! He quoted $140 me based on what I told him: ~15 boxes + furniture, 3rd floor to 1st floor, new apartment was about a block away. He charges a flat rate and has his own pickup truck to get your stuff from point A to point B. After 3 1\/2 years in my old place, I realized I had WAY more shit than I anticipated. I called Shawn a few days before to warn him and he told me it wasn't a problem, but he would have to charge more. Exactly what I expected. I lucked out! They had an extra guy available the day of my move and since I didn't know ahead of time - there was no extra charge! Awesome! Once they arrived and got to see the massive stacks of boxes, Shawn updated the quote. I was nervous, BUT it would only be an extra $60! OMG! Shawn and his crew were outstanding! They were courteous, friendly, careful and quick! My move was flawless. What a relief! Shawn even told me it was their pleasure to move me and that I was a good packer :) Aww! In short: 3 great guys + pickup truck + 3 hours = $200 + tip. I kept them hydrated with frosty beverages and, of course, I fed them when they were done. Be nice to your movers :)","stars":5.0}

I went to dinner this past Friday with a friend of mine that had a groupon (or Living Social deal, I forget which). The decor and ambiance is very nice, and they were empty when we got there. We were seated right away, and the waitress came over right away. Neither of us ordered a drink, and our water came quickly. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally! we got to order! Then we waited and waited and waited. Finally we got to eat! The manager came early in our meal and we confirmed the food was good. The waitress did not come. I put my empty water glass on the edge of the table. And the waitress did not come. I tried to make eye contact, I tried to wave. The waitress did not acknowldge us. Finally my friend went to the manager for water. We were almost done our meal at the point. The food was very good, nothing to scream about, but decent. But it is not worth the wait and terrible service. Also, I did not mind this, but something to note- there was a little boy of about 3 that belonged to the manager\/owner. He kept being helped out of the kitchen and was running around the restuarant, not causing much of a ruckus, but not helping the romantic ambiance. At one point, he came to our table and wanted to sit with us. He said he had chicken nuggets, and I told him to get them and come sit with us. His dad(? I guess) came and retrieved him after a couple minutes. I wouldn't have minded him joining us, but I'm sure many diners would find this very annoying.","stars":2.0}

Drinks were good, the portion on the octopus ceviche was great, ive been to places like oyster house that have smaller portions which is a bummer. I think with time it'll get better, the menu was a bit disorganized. The front page is actually for the bar upstairs which you wouldnt know by looking at it and it apparently serves totally different drinks altogether (kind of weird), and the menu itself was just three pages stapled together. I think for the gold foil quality napkins, this feels like a mistake. I figure maybe their menu covers were being shipped or hadnt arrived for opening day? That was really my only complaint. Will return once they settle in. I think the outside could use better signage, kind of gets overshadowed by the cuban place and bleu martini nearby.","stars":4.0}

A few minutes later the server came back and asked if we needed anything and I told her I had cashed out and the other lady had taken her tip. The server told me that they don't get tips. I told her that was not the implication I got from the lady who took it. When I asked the woman who cashed me out about it she told me that the servers are paid and don't get tips. I explained she was misleading me by asking if my tip was for the server and then taking it. She got defensive and told me it was their profit and called for her brother, the owner. They gave me my cash back, but I want everyone to know your tips are considered \"profit\" to the owner. Yes, I am aware that they might pay servers more than the server wage, but they were intentionally misleading to me.","stars":1.0}

My appointment was close to rush hour, so I got stuck in traffic. I called to say I would be 5-10 min late, and they were accommodating with that. I still received an hour long massage.

{"text":"We went on the Pirate Ship last Friday and we had a good time. This pirate ship is more geared towards the kids than the adults. We don't have kids yet. Luckily, we had fun just watching the kids and interacting with them. You receive unlimited drinks with your admission (various soda, Bud, Bud Light and wine). The kids also come away with quite a few \"treasures\" and faces painted up like pirates. We also lucked out and had a lot of dolphins playing with our ship. There were about 5-6 different groups of dolphins that popped up. One pair was jumping full out of the water two feet away from the ship. I actually saw more dolphins on this ship than I have any of the dolphin tours in the area I have been on (I have been on about 4-5 different ones). Overall I had a fun time and would do it again. I definitely want to do this ship again after I have kids and they are in the 4-7yr old range. My only disappointment was that we asked for the \"sunset\" time and that was at 4:30pm. I was expecting more of a dancing, drunken, dark adult environment from what I had seen on the Pirate Ship in Clearwater...that is not the case for this ship. All the same; I will be back when I have kids. I would also like to note that we had a Groupon and we were not treated poorly or different at all from the people paying full price.

{"text":"A quick story explaining my experience...Dec 19, 2013- After a long day at work at McGuire AFB, NJ, I had stopped by the gas station to grab a few things. Once I got back into my car, I had reached for the keys and attempted to turn my car on. Once I had realized that the key wouldn't turn, it was too late. Due to the stress of the day, I unknowingly used my house key(looks just like a car key) into the damn ignition! The key would not budge at all. It was barely an inch in the ignition. I tried to use some muscle to yank it out and got no positive result. I had called the base Security Forces desk for a locksmith. The number was for LaBar's Lock Shop. The gentleman I spoke to (Mike I believe) was a professional as can be. He was very helpful and polite. He gave me the number to the tow truck company that ended up picking up my car in a very timely manner. Mike told me that he would stay at the shop later than usual, in order to help me out. The very next day, I got a call at 0820 in regards to my vehicle. I was told that the ignition components did not have to be repaired\/replaced. The key that was lodged in there was done, which was the least of my worries. He said to come by and pick up the car, as well as discuss the price of the service. I had my buddy drop me off at the shop, which was very clean and organized inside. The lady at the desk was very polite to me. Needless to say, the price was well below what I expected to pay. I would suggest to anyone in need of a locksmith, to put this number in their phones. From the super fast repair and courtesy, I am beyond pleased. Thank you so much guys. Merry Christmas and happy holidays!","stars":5.0}

There was a table of ~14-16 for bday party which made it super loud in our corner. The place isn't big so they took most of tables. We started with fish soup-too salty and not much to it. Then came our entrees. Curried shrimp and salmon. Both fabulous. Served with awesome rice (this from someone who is meh about rice), saut\u00e9ed veggies and cabbage. I even took a bite of cabbage. They need to update their menu bc the prices we were charged were higher than menu. Another downside was that they were out of several items on the menu. I tried to 3 differothings before I settled on salmon. Also include adult beverage options on menu. The only reason I knew about their punch was from Yelp.

{"text":"So my complaint here is quite peculiar. When we arrived to bowl there were 7 of us with an 8th member still on his way. We asked for two lanes next to each other and after some time they came back and told us our lanes would be in the \"clubhouse\" section of the place. We were very excited so we payed for two hours and went back to basically a private room with nice lighting, a pool table, an arcade machine, a ps4 and large tv and some other cool amenities. We felt so blessed and started bowling. Our experience quickly turned around. Now we're not professionals but we do go bowling frequently to try to raise our skills and for a good place to hang out responsibly. A few of us even brought our own balls because of our partial dedication to becoming better at bowling. When we started bowling there were so many issues with the lanes. pins getting stuck and not reracking, the wrong number of pins being replaced and even sometimes the light would go out and we were unsure if the lanes were working properly. Every time we asked for assistance that had workers that treated us like we were intentionally bowling wrong and breaking the machines. With the two hours that we payed for ticking down while we were unable to properly bowl we decided to start playing pool while we waited for the staff that would take very long to assist our lanes, and when the staff finally arrived to fix our machine they reprimanded us for playing pool and asking us if we payed for it. The problems did not stop there as we continued to face difficulties and losing time that we paid for. We didn't request the special room so why did they give it to us if they were expecting us to be a problem, and no time was added to our bowling due to all of the stoppages and time we had to wait. overall we had three games of bowling in the two hours, when we normally could get 5 or 6 games per two hours. I appreciate their efforts as i'm sure they were understaffed, but our experience was not the same as it is at other places and it costed us some good practice time.","stars":2.0}

When you have to call to get let in the door late at night and the phone system is either completely down or dialing random sleeping employees when you try to press an extension instead of the front desk, it makes me feel unsafe as a very small female to be standing outside alone at 3:00am for a large chunk of time waiting for someone to happen to walk by the window and see you by chance. Pleaaaase fix this! Also, the night time cleaning guys that work here are awesome. They are nice, helpful and professional, and when my phone calls to the front desk DO get through, they are very expedient in letting me in the door so I don't have to stand outside too long. Haven't really dealt with much of the day staff since I only come at night, but other than the poor grumpy people I've woken up on their home phones when the phone system calls them (hey I understand, it is 3:00am....) every staff member has been informative and helpful.

{"text":"Is this guy for real? Pete is as rare as it gets in the mechanic world, and we know--my husband is a mechanic too! From New York, but stranded in Philadelphia while on vacation the day before New Year's eve with a smoking radiator on the side of the highway, we looked up the closest repair stations and found five. Although a mechanic, there was nothing my husband could do to repair or replace an entire radiator while on vacation. Superior had the most consistent and highest reviews...and it was only 8 blocks away. Surely my car would make it (!??!?), and it did. The garage was piled with cars and I was nervous that this place would not give us the time of day...Boy I was wrong. Pete was straight forward, forthright and said he would get our car done. Surely enough he did, even though it was a very big job...replacing the entire radiator and some other important related parts. My husband guessed what the price of this very big job would be and it turned out that he was a few bucks above the actual price. Pete is a gem and so are his guys. They each stayed two and a half hours late that evening to fix my car and get the other customers cars ahead of ours all taken care of. (My apologies to Pete's wife who called around 7:30pm wondering where he was as he was, obviously very late for family dinner!) Those of you who live in Philly are incredibly lucky. Guys and mechanics like this are a rare breed these days. Pete, thanks again!!!!","stars":5.0}

I got the pita with grilled meatballs, tzatziki, cucumber and tomato mix, pickled onions, and a lemon tahini sauce. The pita was only about $9 and huge and stuffed with everything, so it's totally worth the price. The pita bread was super soft and fresh and the meatballs were perfectly cooked. My only complaint is that the sauces mixed all together can make it really \"gloopy\" by the time you finish it, but still a perfect place for lunch or dinner. I would totally go back for lunch after class at school","stars":4.0}

They continue to host great musicians pretty much every night of the week. That hasn't changed. :) Since my last review, Greg, Kelly, and their team have made some positive changes that are important to share. The first is more coverage from the elements - you're still outside, but there is more shade and cooling\/heat depending on the season. The next is service. Our recent experiences have been great with prompt delivery of food and frequent check-ins from the server. Finally, there are more vegetarian options available, including some specials!

{"text":"Googled \"Packer Bar\" while down for a fun weekend in Nashville. And obviously there was one, as there is in every city. We showed up at 11:32 for the noon game, and it was indeed \"Packed\". There was an outdoor bar by a pool that a ton of fans were at, but it looked overly crowded \/ loud. Inside there was much more availability - but when asked to be seated the owner \/ manager said that an entire area was reserved and that \"you need to get here by 9\" as if we knew that or something. He then informed us he had one table available but the game might be only on one TV in that area, we reluctantly opted for our only option but to our pleasant surprise the game was on in that area. I've noted the time of arrival for a variety of reasons, but mainly for the service. I've never had terrible service in the south so I'm weary of assuming everything is slower in the south and this is something I should learn to understand. Also, this is a Packer bar, and it's Sunday during a Packer game - if you're understaffed that's poor management, it's not like you don't know people are going to be here during a Packer game. Either way, the service here was BY FAR the worst I've ever had in any dining experience. It took her 20 minutes to take our drink order. After another 15-30 minutes, about 10 minutes into the game I just decided to go to the bar to order a beer. I saw them pouring our drinks though, so I asked for them and decided to be the server. One of the people in our party ordered the popular build-your-own-blood-mary and he had to wait an additional 15 minutes after I served our drinks for his drink to be made. Finally about an hour into us being there, she came by and said she'll take our food order but then walked away. And didn't come back for another 15 minutes. We had to borrow a menu from someone elses table as those weren't brought to us either. By the time we order we joked about whether or not we'd get our food by halftime, but it was a serious concern. I would love to give this place one star for the complete lack of regard for service as it was the worst service I've ever encountered, BUT the food was fantastic. Also, although it seemed like a rinky dink dive bar, the atmosphere was lively and fun. They boo'd Bears fans viciously when they had to walk through the Packers area to go to the bathroom. They handed out free game towels to everyone in Packers gear. And there was some sort of raffle that was going on, but I didn't stay long enough to understand the prize. Hire more people, or figure out your waitstaff, because if this wasn't the only Packers joint in town - it'd be out of business. I could've gone on","stars":2.0}

I am not a fan of the chili, and neither is my stomach after spending an hour running to the bathroom soon after leaving. The meat sauce was extremely salty and luke warm, poured over cold spaghetti and then covered with handfuls of cold cheese...made within 5-10 mins total. While the taste is definitely different with cinnamon in it...I'm not sure what the hype is about because it was borderline 3000 mg of Sodium disgusting.

{"text":"I was intrigued when I saw that a ramen place was opening in New Tampa. I feel bad for any business that had to open during a pandemic, but Michi Ramen has pivoted to handle it better than any other business I've seen. I personally will only do curbside and delivery right now. The setup they have for curbside pickup is fantastic. You walk up and speak into an intercom. There's a slot in the window for you to put your card into. There's a tiny box with doors on each end they can put your receipt in and another similar large box where they can put your food. You never have to get close to another person and they always have taken care of us quickly! To be honest I liked, but didn't love their ramen. What really has intrigued me is their tea bar. They have several green tea drinks, a few milk teas (with no boba), but also have *yogurt* drinks. I see that even though they have 40+ reviews I'm the first person to mention this. I really had no idea what to expect with a yogurt drink. I thought that \"yogurt\" could possibly mean that it had a thick consistency, but that's not the case. The yogurt apparently just gives it a more powerful flavor. So far my favorite is the grape yogurt drink. It's really refreshing unlike anything I've ever tasted. Thanks for bringing something new to the area Michi Ramen.","stars":4.0}

It took them just under two hours to only clean those areas. I would also like to say here that this home was being serviced weekly by the previous owner who used Molly Maids so it wasn't that dirty in the first place. After they left I found garbage in three of the cabinets that they supposedly cleaned. I paid $142 for them to only clean my kitchen and they didn't even do that well.

There are two entrances and the one on the main street is not clear it is an entrance for the Wyndham - Glens Mills other than the small sign by turn in. When you turn in the first building you come to is BW bar or restaurant NOT Wyndham but it certainly looks like the entrance to a hotel lol You have to drive past this bar to back and turn right to get to the front entrance (high awning over the entrance). First Floor Hallways: 1. A small business center (perhaps two computers and one printer). 2. A game room with one pinball machine, two racing games, a shooter or two, a game that has claws to grab a price to win - I've never seen anyone ever win, a similar game with a scissor to cut line to win what is hanging from it (another no-win game), a pool table, and a knock hockey table (can't remember too well). 3. Exercise room with thread mill, recumbent bike, weights, etc. It's open 24 hours. 4. Breakfast from with continental breakfast offers waffles. There is also a made to order omelet and hot sides counter where the server will make an omelet to order: cheese, bacon, sausage, onions, mushroom, etc. PLUS you can also get a side of bacon, sausage link, and potato. You need to ask. The omelet was tasteless and blah (needs some spices or something.. and I hate tabasco). It was a bonus beyond what is typically offered. The Breakfast Room attendant was great. Very helpful and always asked how everyone was. Unfortunately, the omelet counter had two tip jars. Hotel service staff should not have to put up a tip jar where they service clients, more importantly, the hotel needs to pay these hard-working people better instead of subsidizing their below or at minimum wage jobs with tips as a form of income. There is also a large additional seating area across the hallway. All free for hotel guests. Further down the hall is a restaurant\/bar. Down another hallway is the meeting rooms, a goldfish tank, an ATM, and where the management office is located.

{"text":"Dargan's hadn't intrigued me at all until I read that they offer an Indian curry. As a fan of inauthentic food, I've long wanted to try some sort of U.K. reinterpretation of Indian cuisine; I understand it branched off to become its own thing at some point in history. My ladyfriend and I thus visited one evening to sample their curry alongside a more classical Irish pub dish, their corned beef and cabbage. (We did this as an Irish-y band we could hear but not quite see played away on the stage, which I choose to believe added something to the experience.) The curry, colored a vividly British-bleak shade of brown, comes atop rice or French fries, a false choice if ever there was one -- you must choose both. They call it \"spicy,\" but... shyeah. Still, I felt vaguely transgressive eating curry with French fries in it until I realized that most of the curries I eat already contain regular potatoes. But then I realized that this curry also contained regular potatoes alongside the fries, and the awareness of eating both at once replenished some of the thrill. The corned beef definitely tasted like corned beef, but the cabbage put up a little too much resistance to my bite. If I understand U.K. sensibilities, cabbage ought to come out stewed nearly into a paste. I understand I might as well have just eaten a pound of salt, but damn, did I dig this meal -- and hey, I balanced it all with a pint of Guinness. Perhaps this explains the life expectancy issues in certain regions of the British Isles. I shall return for the bangers and mash and the shepherd's pie, the two other highlights of the menu's \"traditional fare\" section. Why on Earth would you order out of another?","stars":3.0}

I imagine going to \"champagne bar\" would be vivacious and exciting. This is a bar that serves an impressive and extensive list of champagne. We came in on our anniversary during our trip to Nola, to have a couple glasses of champagne to kick off the evening. My first impression, dark. And loud. It wasn't busy when we arrived and our server took a few minutes to talk to us about the chef and to recommend a flight. Of course I want a flight! After spending time in Reims studying champagne, it's one thing I know a lot about. It would've been nice to get more info about the champagnes we were choosing than just the name. I mean...we're in a champagne bar. And the Yelp guide says \"classy attire\"...nope. Even the waiters and waitresses had on what looked like comfortable, but very dirty shoes. Oh well. Comfort over style. It's just a champagne bar, with \"Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame '06\" for $425 a bottle. Who needs it served in classy shoes... side eye It took a while for my \"War of the Ros\u00e9s\" flight to arrive and every single drop was delicious. I found a nice tasting guide online that walked me through my 3 tastes. Thank God for Google. Our waiter disappeared and even when he came over to ask how we were doing, he grabbed the empty glasses and turned his back before we could say anything.

Fish sandwich was very dry and therefore not good. Never got water for all who asked. Water nor soda was ever refilled for those who did. Bar was clearly struggling too.

For a place this eclectic you really need to explain HOW to order, but the guy that took our order just looked at us like we were stupid. When writing down what we wanted he gave no indication that he was listening to us or understood. He toggled between staring down at the piece of paper he wasn't even writing on and glaring at us waiting for us to order. However, the food was good.

{"text":"When I mentioned this place was near my new job, my girlfriend went nuts and said we had to try it. So we did. Was the ice cream great? Yes it was. But other factors keep this place at 3 stars for me. 1. Lack of seating -The seats here are all outside, which means it's hot (being it's Florida, after all), but more than that, there just weren't all that many. 2. No bathroom? -Seriously, I don't think there's a bathroom here. If there was one, I didn't see it. 3. Lack of service -There was one guy there. He was friendly, but I don't think anyone else was there with him, so things that should have been handled fast took a long time. What are the good parts? 1. The ice cream -It is seriously amazing. Nothing else to it. Melts slow (even in FL heat) and had big portions. 2. The variety -Lots of choices of flavors, toppings, styles, scoop sizes... I might be back, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to be back.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Underwhelming and a true waste of potential is probably the best description. Over the last 3 years I have sampled across the menu in a futile attempt to find something worth ordering a second time. (10+ visits) But this mornings experience is the catalyst for my review. Service was traditionally slow and rather than wait for an americano, I went for the self serve coffee. After walking home and tasting the brew, THE COFFEE WAS NOT LA COLOMBE. It was weak, watery and had a slightly artificial mouth feel associated with super market brands. If it was La Colombe (unlikely), it was not brewed to makers instructions. As Epicure advertises it serves La Colombe, I have also notified La Colombe on the issue. I take my coffee seriously and am a very loyal La Colombe drinker. On the rest of the menu - none of the baked goods taste fresh. Bagels are comparable to Thomas'\/Lenders. The oven roasted turkey was dry. The breakfast sandwich egg ratio is WAY off (unbelievably, too much egg!!). There's something funky going on with the salads that I do not wish to speculate on. +1 star because the owners are genuinely nice folks and there's so much potential with a few quality adjustments. I've politely and discreetly provided feedback in the past because I want all the businesses on the Conrad corridor to do well and it has not worked. Losing Brothers (now Laxmis) has really hurt in terms of quick breakfast\/lunch. But I do welcome an Indian restaurant in the neighborhood and the food is tasty!","stars":2.0}

Tacos made with those supermarket corn tortillas (that fall apart as you eat them); bland, COLD salsa and less-than-fresh chips at the salsa bar; dry, CUBIC chicken in the salad; a meager splash of mole on the enchiladas; extra $ for sour cream in a burrito?, for whole wheat tortillas?; a lack of spiciness and flavor, and not a jalapeno to be found ! Even the lime wedge was hard and under ripe. Dear Mission Burrito PA, please stop fooling people that this is the way it should be.

{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening which was probably a mistake on my part. It was full but not overcrowded upon our arrival around 6pm. There were 3 of us and we were added to the queue right away after being told it would be about a 20 minute wait. In the end we waited more than hour. The seating protocol seemed hopelessly confused as larger parties who came in after us got seated before us. After about 45 minutes we questioned the hostess about this. Her response was that we were an odd number of diners and they preferred to seat larger groups first. We were kind of dumbfounded. In the end they seated us at a table for 4. Go figure... The salads were great but the chicken was not as good. It was nicely cooked but it was way too salty - and I like salt. It was also spicy which is really not a bad thing but it was not expected. If you don't like Popeyes then skip the chicken. And, $34 for a whole chicken is a stretch. (Plus they did the usual warm and fuzzy scare tactic marketing that their chicken didn't have antibiotics, hormones, blah, blah, blah. A chicken is 43 days old when it is slaughtered. It doesn't have time to need pharmaceuticals. Besides, hormones, antibiotics. steroids, etc., cost more than a chicken is worth. ) The sides were good but they were skimpy. $8 for two biscuits and a piece of vanilla flavored sweet (think cake) cornbread was not worth the price. I'm not a tightwad by any stretch but this place was way overpriced. $80 for 3 people, (no drinks, and no dessert) is a lot for 1 chicken, 2 sides, 2 biscuits, and 2 salads. My recommendation? Go across the street to Olio and get some great small plates, a good cocktail, a glass of unique wine instead.","stars":3.0}

The first thing that struck me when we walked in was the line of people, all on their cellphones texting (perhaps to let others know they had arrived?). The second thing that I noticed was how noisy it was :-( Yes, it is VERY noisy (people talking everywhere loudly noisy). So, if you are wanting a \"quiet, romantic\" evening, this is NOT the place. Beyond the host\/hostess desk there is a curtain and that leads to the lounge area....it is hidden away, something that is nice, but I am wondering if the group that owns this place did any \"sound proofing\" since it is SO noisy (I know, I said this already). On to our meal... Seated quickly (we made reservations), our waiter was at our table within a couple of minutes with water and also to greet us. We got the wine list and WOW. No, there are not any bottles of anything under 40$ unless you go with their \"house\" wines, then you get under 40$ but not by much. We had a house Chardonnay which was quite good (our waiter, Mike was kind enough to let us know how \"oaky\" it would be :-) ). With the nice selection of entrees, though most of them with a pasta or rice, for my appetizer, I chose the bacon wrapped scallops with rice balls and my companion the half order of Kale and Quinoa Salad and for my entree I chose the Hoisin Braised Short Ribs, my companion the Lobster Ravioli with Shrimp and Cream. The Kale and Quinoa Salad was VERY good and well dressed. The flavour of the dressing was not too heavy and with the Quinoa it was a nice complement :-) My scallops were good (2 of them, medium sized) wrapped in one slice of bacon with a nice cream and the accompanying chutney was very tasty. The little rice balls were about the size of a small jawbreaker candy and also good as they were bland enough to enjoy with the chutney. (I will say, I enjoyed the Kale and Quinoa Salad here more than the one I had at Canteen.) Our entrees came and the Short Ribs were VERY good and tender, tender....I didn't need a knife to cut it at all. They were served with baby carrots and 3 onion rings on top. Nice plating and it was a perfect size portion :-) The ravioli were also quite good and also quite spicy.

I was beyond impressed with the speedy service and awesome table -- we were right by the kitchen, which I love. The food was incredible; Peche still has some of my favorite oysters in the city. I was really taken with the vibe of the place too, which is why I felt surprised when I went back a few months later and didn't receive the same kind of service. Rounded up my girls for an early bachelorette supper after sipping drinks by the Ace Hotel's pool all day. We were all so stoked to get there, lounge, eat and relax. I ordered red wine and pie first, because hi-hello, it was my bachelorette party! This put the waiter off a great deal, and caused ALL of our other food to come out at the same time. We were super hurried through our meal, I guess because he thought we were drunk and going to stiff him on the tip? Not sure what happened there, but it really bummed me out that we were there to spend time (and money) on our supper, and wound up being finished in just under an hour. I will OBVIOUSLY go back because the food and beverage game was strong. Just hope their servers are currently more willing to let their guests unwind! This is the big easy!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I have been here twice now, both times for dinner. Both times the service has been pretty mediocre. It is also way too loud, especially in the back where it is a wall of booth seating. You are basically sitting on top of the other people. Too many kids, and they were not well behaved. I know that is not in the restaurants control but i prefer less children if i am going to be dining at a nicer place. The first time they brought me the wrong drink but did rectify it. Food is good but overpriced. I say that understanding that you pay for the experience and overhead as well as the cost of food. I just don't see the value in this place. Last night i was upcharged a $1 for a tomato on a burger. I found that so odd. The meat on the burger was good but not very flavorful. I am used to a lot more spice when i make my own. I wish this place well but i doubt i will be back.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"Went down to the Magazine Street area for some late afternoon lunch and decided to give this place a try. Although it was packed, the wait was only about ten minutes. I noticed a lot of tables had these massive piles of nachos so I figured they must be good. So we ordered a small order of the Damn Good Nachos...they are damn good, but be forewarned...even the small is massive and a lot of food for two people to share. For our meal we shared the Taco Trifecta which comes with one side. Our three tacos were Chipotle Shrimp, Duck Duck Goose (which we flipped a coin for over the Carolina BBQ), and the Crispy Fish (typed in the order of how good I personally thought they were). Our side was the black beans with the chorizo which was good. Chipotle Shrimp Taco was definitely a solid go to. Duck Taco was decent and I wasn't a huge fan of the Crispy fish. I thought it was more soggy and I kinda wish we either went with the Carolina BBQ taco or the Flaked Fish Taco which was a blackened version. I'll have to try those on the next go around. This is definitely a worthwhile place to visit. This is a good lazy weekend hangout place or would be a fun place for with your friends.","stars":4.0}

I've had weird billing issues that were difficult to straighten out; no one ever enforces the \"no cell phone policy\" on the floor even when you go to complain about it; during summer afternoons there are lots of little kids running around in between classes and generally being disruptive - if not outright having to be chased off the cardio equipment where they aren't supposed to be.","stars":2.0}

He was helpful, personable, verified our order and was very pleasant. Great job today Walden's and five stars for Michael! OK so Waldens encourages you during this Covid issue to call in your order and it will be waiting for you when you get there however when they take their phone off the hook because as the barista put it we were just too busy and getting too many calls it's very bad for business. I only know that the phone was off the hook because we actually drove over parked went inside to place our order and questioned gosh you're not that busy right now but your phone is been busy for the last hour. The young man at the register checked the phone and his phone was fine however the young lady at the other end of the bar advised us that it had been just too busy and she took the phone off the hook. So phone orderers beware that some of the young people working at Walden's are without a clue regarding customer service or how important paying customers add to the bottom line of a business. Zero stars today if I could've done that. Walden's is hit or miss on a good day. Today for breakfast, other than being too expensive for what they serve, tables were dirty and staff seemed unorganized.. Food was only so-so. The self-serve coffee bar was out of coffee but when they replaced it, my coffee cup ended up being mostly coffee grounds.

We had the pleasure of meeting the chef as well, he was so friendly and engaging. He was more than happy to talk food with us which is always fun! We had the Nueva Sampler (chips with salsa, guacamole and queso ) all of the dips were fresh and delicious. The guacamole was home made, chunky and delicious. My husband and I shared the El Rey Chimichanga served wet with queso. It was plenty of food for us to share and was so flavorful!

Sadly, I only stayed a few minutes because I had serious trouble finding a seat and the line at the counter never seemed to move. I'm not sure if it's the shopping center, more people living in the area, or what, but the few experiences I've had with typically predictable national brands in this plaza have not been up to the standards for these businesses. This location is much bigger and nicer than the location that was previously across the street. The crowd inside was all business too, which is a great indicator of who's living in the area. All that said, the store doesn't seem set up to handle the increased volume they're experiencing. I stood in the line for what felt like 10 minutes and only saw it inch forward. I just wanted a cup of black coffee and a seat to do a little work, but it looked like that could take 15-20 minutes so I went up to the store on S. Virginia by Total Wine (notoriously bad for seating too) and was seated (with power nearby) in 5 minutes. Giving three stars for benefit of the doubt that this was just an off day. It certainly isn't what I've come to expect from Starbucks.","stars":3.0}

I sit at the bar another 5-10 minutes and then the other worker ask who I put the order in with and I tell her. Well apparently Emoni did not put the order in. At this point I'm upset. They asked if I wanted to place another order but that's another 20-30 minute wait and at this point I'm just tired after a long days works so I decline and there was no consideration to even give me a discount for my inconvenience even if I decided to order.","stars":1.0}

I was picked up after being broke down on Franklin Howard Bridge in Tampa Fl, the woman I spoke to on the phone gave me a flat rate of $120 for cash $140 for card payment. I rode with the driver to be taken to my apartment in temple terrace. The Dispatcher gave him the wrong address to get to my residence and I told him it was wrong several times, he still proceeded to take me to the wrong address. After he pulls into to this residential area I told him I don't live here. He starts slamming his hands on the wheel yelling in Spanish, and making several calls on his phone. He puts the correct address in his GPS, and gets even more upset that's in an additional 20 minutes away. He's speeding the whole way, making several phone calls yelling, mind you, the passenger seat belt doesn't even work. So I'm not even buckled up. We finally get to temple terrace, and he's speeding down the streets to where he passes where we need to turn and I told him to turn around. He slams on his breaks. Get out of the truck and is screaming on the phone to someone and DEMANDS $125 dollars cash from me. I told him the woman I spoke to on the phone said I could use a card and he said, no cash only. I told him I don't have that much cash on me I need to find an ATM to take out the rest. He drives like a maniac to the circle K gas station, and has me run in to get his money. The ATM, isn't working. After me trying to call my boyfriend for help, the truck driver is harassing me in the gas station for his money. And hovering over me while I try to call for help. He makes me walk down the street to the McDonalds to use their ATM to pull out the money. We walk back to the gas station while I've been crying this whole time from such DISRESPECTFUL treatment.

I have tried tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, chicken josh and saag, and I've not been disappointed at all. They serve rice or 3 rotis, whatever you prefer. If not stated, expect a good amount of butter\/oil on the rotis. Food comes with plain yogurt, pickle and onions. Food is authentic, not crazy spicy and delicious. You'll end up taking some portion to-go. They give one to-go box per person and charge extra for additional to-go boxes.

I prefer the other location to this one which is why I gave this one 3 stars. They never give us condiments unless we ask. At different times we've ordered cheese sticks and mushrooms and both were very dry without some kind of dipping sauce. The mushrooms were definitely not the best I've ever had. When you take a bite, you get more of a mouthful of grease than actual mushroom. We usually have to repeat our order back several times before they get everything and we're not the type that just spits everything out in one long breath. Customer service is pretty sub-par. They're not rude but they're not very welcoming either. We normally order burgers when coming here but I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich trying to be somewhat healthy (it's kind of impossible here). My chicken was very dry and tough.

It's attached to the arena itself so you never have to walk far, and the only thing that sucks is waiting in line to get out of it. I advise leaving just a few minutes before the end of the game, even though that might make me a bad fan. The Club seats rock & the free food and drinks don't hurt, and if you want a mixed drink just wander around the main level & you're bound to see a vendor selling just that. If you have a chance to eat in the restaurant, DO IT! There's a kick ass buffet up there, and you should see the dessert section... never expected that during a hockey game, but those chefs definitely deliver. Fun atmosphere, great lighting and sound, and tons of fun. Blues fans get rowdy though, so watch out, and NEVER get up during a play.

The manicure itself I would rate 4\/5 and the salon does have a nice selection of colors however I was not anticipating a $10 gel polish removal fee. In my experience with gel manicures I have rarely had a removal fee and if so it was never more than $3. Additionally their method of removal, to scrap, without soaking the nail first is painful. There are nail salons on every corner and most without bogus charges, needless to say - I won't be back.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"My experience at Mi Ranchito was not very positive. First and foremost once we were seated our server did not get our drink order for atleast 10 minutes. After he got our drink order he didn't come back for our food order for for another 20-30 minutes. Your probably wondering why I waited so long but I was with a group of people and we were were having great conversations. So it didn't dawn on us that the srver hadnt taken our order. Then when he finally took our order the food came back after maybe another 20 minutes. So we sat in our booth for an hour before getting our food. Our server let us know that he does not normally waite tables which is probably the reason for the poor service. The food was pretty good but I can honestly say I was so hungry by the time it came to the table I couldnt eat it fast enough. O yeah and parking is horrible. If its a busy night good luck finding a parking space.","stars":2.0}

We have gotten the sausage and fresh mozz which was very good and their margherita pizza is very good as well. Their homemade marinara is awesome. Their alcoholic beverages are quite large..the wine comes out in a goblet..so that's good if you're into that (which I believe I am). Either way, this place is good..not great.

{"text":"The pizza here at Rusty's was delicious, but, I must give you a list of pros and cons. Pros: Cute building Nice view Good pizza Wait not too long (if they get your order right...) 15 minutes Cons: The Mexican waitress at the desk was utterly not educated. She looked about 25 to me, even. They didn't get our order right the first time. We asked what crusts there are. The uneducated woman said, \"Thin or thicker.\" We said thick about 2 times. When the order showed up on the register, it said \"thin\". We said, \"why does it say thin?\" The woman said \"Thin or thicker.\" I then said, \"we want thicker.\" She finally--after about 10 minutes--finished the order. We went to our table. After about 10 minutes of waiting, I checked the receipt and almost screamed. The receipt said \"Thin crust\". We waited for the order to come and as I heard my name, I walked over. The pizza had thin crust. I told the Mexican girl, \"We asked for thicker crust.\" She then blamed it on the guy that made the pizza, when it wasn't his fault. It was her fault for making the wrong order when we specifically told her 5 times, \"Thicker crust\". So when you order thick crust, make sure to say thick-ER and not thick. Hopefully they'll get your order right. The bathrooms didnt smell bad, but there were so many words carved on the toilet seat and door, even on our eating table! Come on, you should have enough money to at least repaint or replace things. Noisy. Noisy, noisy, noisy. Noisy!! The thing that lured us to Rusty's was the terrific smell. Overall, the pizza was great, but the service and facility were HORRIBLE. If you're bored of seafood, I WOULD recommend this. But beware the horrible service...","stars":3.0}

The bread was the highlight of the meal. 2. Lots of white servers \/ workers who know very little about the food \/ culture they are representing.

A man behind the counter told us we could sit outside if we liked and someone would be with us soon. Our waitress finally brought menus and was friendly and polite but felt very rushed and didn't check on us as often as I'd have liked but it looked like she was the only one working and I know how hard being short handed is. We ordered 3 rolls (spicy tuna, Rainbow, and Hawaiian) all three were absolutely fantastic. The Hawaiian took a little longer to come out but the toasted coconut and pineapple sauce it's served with made it feel like a rich dessert so that worked out perfect. The only reason I'm giving a 4 out of 5 would be due to the low staffing and the bathroom needed some major attention. Doesn't look like it gets tended to often.

I had to tell her how to place my highlights so they looked \"natural\" and I'm not even sure she knows how to use a curling iron. \"I want Farrah Faucet hair\" - it shouldn't be hard to do big, feathery curls!

This time i ordered chicken noodles, wonton soup, beef and broccoli combo meal. I have to say both noodle dishes were the best i have ever had. The chicken noodles (ordered from the \"noodles\" section of the menu, not to be confused with lo-mein, and is like a soup almost, but mostly noodles)broth was garlicky and dark and the noodles tasted fresh and homemade. Delicious!! The wonton soup broth was milder and good, but OMG, the wontons were like heaven. Definitely homemade, the light airy softness almost dissolves in your mouth on contact and the sausagy filling was divine. I want to order that every time from now on. The beef and broccoli was good except it has that same too thick super-salty sauce that was on the Happy Family last time. (Its really like salt paste and it overpowers the meat and veggies. Nobody likes that anymore!) The meat was really tender and broccoli was nicely crisp still. The eggroll the combo meal came with was really fresh crispy and good, though, like a Vietnamese eggroll. I think it was also housemade. The fried rice was really boring and flavorless. Some onion, garlic and soy sauce would do wonders to jazz that up. Anyway, if you stick to the noodle dishes, this place is great! I think i will try the veggie only dishes and duck next time.","stars":4.0}

The cat became acquainted to my moms house and had a litter of kittens, the kittens and mom had got a eye infection and my mom decided to take the cats in to get their eyes fixed and kitties adopted. I come home today to find out they euthanized the mom cat. She had a short tail because she lost part of it before we ever met her over 2 years ago. The criminals at the humane society said that her tail was infected it spread to her spine and she \"couldn't be let go because she was in so much pain that cats don't show their pain\" when my mom told them that it's been like that for years and she's been perfectly fine waiting on food and taking care of her kittens they insisted that my mom sign a paper to euthanize her and that they weren't letting her go free because \"she could keep having litters of kittens\" Which makes no sense, there is a supposedly extremely sick cat who must be killed because she can keep having kittens? How does that make any logical sense what so ever? So these people took a cat with an eye infection who needed to get fixed and killed her because she was feral and had kittens. I think they need to be fined for lying but they won't and it angers me that there is no consequence for them. This cat is dead and they could care less tossing her away like a piece of organic trash. If you really don't care if the animal lives or dies feel free to bring it here they'll do everything they can to convince you that you did the right thing so you can sleep better at night.

The parking looks a little ghetto as its a lil chained off but the hotel begins to shine as soon as you walk into the door. The staff is one of the friendliest staffs I've ever encountered. I got off to a rough start as my room was next to one with 3 barking dogs (so yes this hotel is pet friendly) but the staff was quick to run up a new room key and apologetic. The hotel itself is all themed out with the moon and the solar system which is unique and pretty groovy. There's even a rotating moon on the rooftop. The rooms are equipped with a nice little snackbar- I was a total sucker for the gummy bear shaped jar filled with gummy bears. The bed is comfortable, there's free wifi, and the rooms are nice overall. The gym is equipped with personal tvs. I'd love to try this place for an out of this world meeting experience one of these days. There's a bowling alley next door as well.

{"text":"Went here last week to meet up with some family and wanted to try something new... and WOW! This place is awesome. Just what Glenside needs... something a little more upscale and fresh than the places we normally hit... (aka the Keswick, Glenside Pub, Blue Comet). The place looks really cool and it's sort of \"old meets new\"... rustic walls with new wood ceilings and bar. Some things look restored but mostly its new and cleaned up. The light fixtures are the coolest I've seen and want to get matching ones for my house. (Only minor complaint... It's loud! There is not a soft surface in the building and voices echo throughout. There was a large bar crowd and they are loud. I personally didn't mind it too much as I am used to going to busy bars in the city... but my poor mother couldn't hear a word we were saying.) The menu is... just crazy amazing. I wanted to try everything, but I couldn't... it's not the cheapest place either, but not too bad. The prices seemed on par with the quality of the food that was delivered. The menu is what is making me take the time to write this review! We decided to just get appetizers so we could try more without stuffing ourselves and breaking the bank... Where to begin: Fois Gras - was some of the best I've ever had... it was over a fennel puree and had beets and pistachios. The flavor combination was terrific. Carrot Pierogies - Melted in your mouth... A little different than traditional pierogies (which might upset you if that is what your expecting) but in a good way. Chorizo Mac n Cheese - Was tasty. The cheese was a little separated however from sitting under too much heat I think though. They were also LAVA HOT. Beef Tongue - Yes... Tongue. (I like to order the weird stuff on the menu that I've never tried before) And this was really good... It was a little like a reuben sandwich with slaw. Clams - Were my favorite... I'm not even sure what they put on them (bacon or pancetta) but they were really good... One other minor complaint - GIVE ME MORE OF THE JUICE! Dipping the bread was the best part. The juice is like liquid gold. Dessert - We had the pistachio olive oil cake and the pumpkin panna cotta and both were also amazing. The beer list was good... Lagunitas IPA on draft! The menu has so much more and I can't wait to go back this week!","stars":5.0}
