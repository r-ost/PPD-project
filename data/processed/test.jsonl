{"text":"We have been to The Vault many times now. The pizza and calamari are great! The reason for my 1 star review is the service we have received from the same waitress 2x now. She is awful! Twice now her service is the slowest I've ever seen. We went in last night with a family who had never dined here and our 3 British and Brazilian soccer coaches our families were hosting for the week. We told them how great the food is here, which it is but the beyond poor service RUINED it! One of the coaches and our daughter did not receive their food until everyone at the table was already done eating. She also would walk by the table not making eye contact and also not asking if everything was okay. We had to ask someone else about the missing food. No refills. Waited 30 min longer for the check and for her to come back for the check. The place was not overly busy, so in my opinion, NO EXCUSES. This is the same type service we've received twice now so we will definitely make sure to avoid sitting in her section next time. Disappointing how a server can completely ruin a great place! \n\nShe's the one with the glasses and raspy voice, never got her name. She could really benefit from some training by the other members of the staff here.","stars":1.0}

They have a great atmosphere with great music, customer service, and products being served. I am quite partial to their pastries and non-coffee drinks.\n\nIt is a little gem in the rough in an area I wouldn't have expected to find something like this, but that was a pleasant surprise. I usually find it to not ever be crazy busy. I venture to their backroom with a high-top long table to plug in and study without being in the main dining room. I enjoy my mini escape and with access being right next to the bathrooms.\n\nI can genuinely say this is one of the better coffee shops in Nashville. I still laugh at the name though. When living in DC, there was a coffee chain shop in the area that was of the same name. I do not think they are related, but would be quite happy if they were considering I liked District Coffee Shop in DC.","stars":5.0}

I could have eaten 3 or 4 of those and they aren't small. \nMy friend had the Texas dog and that was really good too. I think it had chili and bacon and cheese and onions and jalapenos and I think that's it.\n\nAside from the normal menu there's a daily board with 4 or 5 more dogs on it.

On my very first appt I walked in and immediately felt at ease. The front  office staff were very friendly to me. After getting taken in the back they brought me a bottle of water and a thank you for choosing them card. I thought that was  nice .  The dentist assured me that pain control was the top priority in this office and that they wanted my visit to be pain free. When I returned a couple days later to have the tooth worked on everyone was once again very nice and professional. My dentist was true to his word about numbing me up nice. I did not feel a thing and it was all very fast so I didn't have to miss much work. I also like the way they take your blood pressure before starting any work on you. My previous dentist did not do that. The office was very clean from the front office  to the exam rooms.

{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  My very first time visiting this venue was a nightmare.  First off, when we got there, the girls at the front didn't greet us, they just said, \"You can seat yourself.\"  So, my party of three sat down, then it took about twenty minutes for a waitress to come.  When she came, she just said, \"Do you know what you want to order?\" After repeating ourselves several times, it was obvious that she couldn't comprehend anything we were saying or she was very new. The drinks that we ordered came, and although I just ordered a water, I didn't get it.  When I asked her where mine was, she went and got me one and put it on the table with a really dry \"sorry.\"  The food was taking forever, so we asked someone for a manager. He never came.  We had to ask someone else.  The manager came and we asked for another waiter\/waitress, because she couldn't comprehend anything we were saying. The new waiter came after about fifteen to twenty minutes ready to take our order.  At this point, we were very confused, because we had already placed our order with the other waitress. The waiter went to tell the manager about it, and my friend saw the manager shoo us off behind our backs, as if he was tired of us.  We left without getting any food at all.  I do not recommend this place at all.  It was very loud, unprofessional and kind of dirty.  None of the waitresses seemed interested in serving; they were more willing to flounce around and be seen in those short, tight shorts they had on. There is absolutely nothing about this place that was professional or acceptable. I will never, in my life, go back to this place, and I will never suggest this place to anyone.","stars":1.0}

And this visit was no different. \n\nIt wasn't like I was a product on an assembly line needing a repair. Everyone was very human with me. They are very professional with all of their procedures and at the same time they are caring and very courteous and they really make efforts to achieve excellence in their work.\n\nI very much appreciated these qualities. And I'm really a fan of this hospital now. I really feel I received the best possible care here.\n\nAdditionally, I was very pleased to see the ventilation system in the ceiling of the operating room. It looked like the special kind of ventilation system I had seen demonstrated at a tech company. These systems draw bacteria away from the operating table.\n\nAlso, the scene of the beach on the ceiling in operating room #7 was a nice touch. \n\nIn addition, I am in the midst of a remarkable recovery. My last groin hernia operation, 11 years ago, brought me 4 days of mind-blowing pain. And all I could do was crawl on my hands and knees during those 4 days. I couldn't even stand up. This time I have no real pain. I've had soreness and mild discomfort. That's it.\n\nI can sit, stand, walk and go up and down stairs without pain. And it has only been 2 days. It's just remarkable.

My doctor was Dr. Nicholas Faino [whom I was able to have as my regular doctor-so happy]. Dr. Faino is wonderful. He took such great care of me; always asking how I was feeling, if I was comfortable. He also explained everything that was going to happen. He was especially concerned that I was feeling okay because my filling was a big one. I commented to him that it was nice to have the numbing cream for the needle left in my mouth for almost 15-20 minutes, which was great because I did not feel one spec of pain from the needle he administered. Unlike my past dentists who left the numbing cream on for 5 seconds--I have been around for a long time with dental work so I know. His staff was very nice and comforting to me as well.

The food is still on the tasty side...as long as your order is correct and you've not waited a half an hour to 40 min in a heavily populated and tense line for it.

Everything was really dry & just seemed like it was frozen.

Thats what I would order if I went back.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Definitely don't understand why they have such great ratings..  The food was terrible. I'd rather pay $30 each platter of meat than come here again for all you can eat. I barely ate cause I was so disappointed.\n\nFirst off, the grills here are awful. Does not cook food fast enough nor gets hot enough and it dries out the meat. It's really small and you can barely finish grilling one platter. \n\nSecond off, the sides are so excruciatingly offensive to Korean food... The kimchi tasted like they were made with straight up gochujjang sauce... That is not how you make kimchi. And we had roasted peanuts.. \n\nThe cherry on top to the whole experience is the meat... The galbi was not marinated properly. And so were the others. The only thing tolerable was the shrimp and mushrooms... Which says a lot. We stuck with just one thing, the thinly sliced beef which we had to marinate ourselves because it was flavorless. I regret going here so much. It was a waste of money...","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I was super excited to see this store in Green Hills. I came across it by chance after not coming to the mall in quite a while right after it had just opened and had always wanted to try their products. I was definitely not disappointed and have come back every couple weeks since. All of their associates are super friendly and also have been very knowledgeable about all of their products. They'll ask you a few questions about what you're looking for or like and walk you around the store showing you and letting you smell products. I've tried so many of their bath bombs, soaps, body butters, and masks now and have been blown away by them. When you look at the price of the bath bombs and soaps it can be a little daunting if you're not used to it, but with most of the bath bombs you can split them at their seam if you tap them with a screwdriver if you want to get more use out of one. Also they can cut their soaps to any size, whether you're wanting just to try a little piece or get a big bar. They have fresh masks that are refrigerated and come in every Thursday. On the tub they come in it tells you which person they were made by and when to use them by as well, which I love. On top of that it's great that all of their products are cruelty-free.","stars":5.0}

It is very dog friendly, offers decent trails, places to picnic, very scenic, quiet, and more. My dogs thoroughly enjoy walking around the trails and exploring and of course barking at everything: other dogs, wildlife, people, ugh! They are good dogs, they just think they need to prove who is alpha, insert eye rolling emoji. They are still young and undergoing training. In any case, people do not seem to mind and are quite friendly. They just laugh it off and joke about the situation. In any case, this park offers a lot and is worth exploring.

{"text":"First of all, I would like to say I am taking time out of my personal and business day to write this review.  This past Saturday night we decided to try The Rudder out for the first time since we spend most of the summer on the lake and really enjoyed Anchor High Restaurant last year.  Unfortunately, this was by far the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant!  We got to The Rudder at about 8pm on Saturday night and for that reason, expected a wait.  They told us it would be about 1 1\/2 hours.  We were fine with that.  About a hour into the wait, I went to the bar to order an appetizer of wings just to hold my boyfriend over who ran the full marathon that day.  The bartender told me it would be 1 1\/2 to 2 hours before I recieved the wings.  I asked for a manager.  The manager went to the kitchen and came back with wings and appologized.  I asked him if thats the kind of wait we should expect after we actually get a table and I was lead to believe that would not be the case at all.  After 2 hours we were finally seated.  The first thing our waiter tells us when he walks up to the table was \"Our kitchen is closed, we won't be able to serve you.\"  After I realized this was not a joke, I demanded a manager to our table.  He came over and made excuses that there must be a misunderstanding and said he needed to go talk to the kitchen.  He came back and said they would serve us but it would be almost 2 hours before we could get our food. We were so hungry at this point we decided to just leave.  The couple beside us had 2 kids with them and said they had been there since 7 pm and their kids had just got their food but they still had not and were leaving as well.  I am an understanding person when it comes to new restaurants and they have to work out their kinks but the line was crossed on so many levels Saturday night.  If they would have just told us on the very front end the situation we would have been more understanding and could have left and ate somewhere else and come back another night.  After that experience, I will NEVER go back and am going to make people aware of the terrible service and experience we had.  After our 30 minute boat ride back home, we thanked Papa Johns for pulling through for us so quickly and ate pizza at almost midnight.  I would NOT suggest going here at all!!!!! Stick to going to The Black Pearl!!!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Came with a larger party of 5 on a quiet Sunday brunch morning. First off, the building is amazing! I'm truly in love with it, we sat on the second floor with all the bright windows empitamising the openness. It's a perfect mix of modern (gray everywhere, my favorite home decor color), with older style of subway tiled bars and hexagonal tile floors. Yes, I had to spend time and Google the history more while we were waiting. I only wish I could have experienced it in its heyday. \n\nNot sure who our server was, but she was great. We stayed for a while as we ended up staggering drink orders (a beer to start, then a whiskey, the one bloody Mary, then another etc). She let us take our time and catch up too, not hurrying us or being annoyed. \n\nBetween us all we had duck sliders, macaroni and cheese, traditonal burger, the German and the pork belly tacos. My impression was everyone enjoyed their food. The burger disappeared, we made our friend make the Wendy's \"$2.99\" joke with the sliders, the German had great flavor and the macaroni and cheese was ooey and gooey with real Bacon crumbles on top. The ketchup is house made and delcious. The tacos were good just cory was expecting soft tacos not fried, but he survived. He already said he is getting the depot burger next time.\n\nI have been craving some creme brulee which they didn't have in their dedicated and fancy sounding dessert list, but they did have a creme de pot (so custard) with house whipped cream and some sort of black sprinkles I missed the name of. Whatever they were, this was a perfect ending to my meal and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.\n\n\nThe bloody Mary's were excellent, also house mixture. But the happy hour looks to be a good deal, about $2 off drinks and apps it looked like. I think while they have spendier items, they also have a good deal with cheaper options that aren't just olives or fries like you see elsewhere in town. \n\nI had been putting off visiting thinking it would be pretentious and break the bank, and while between us all we splurged for this meal, you come back and not spend much while still getting a lot of quality food. \n\n\nAlso they have the bean board games (the name is completely escaping me right now) out front that we all had fun with too. Ideal for killing time if waiting per chance? As well also a huge luxury couch with games upstairs too.","stars":5.0}

If your customers annoy you maybe you should do something else, and get rid off the skater haircut, you're in your 40s, you douche. The cash only thing really bothers me, it's 2015, if the 2-4% you pay per transaction really bothers you, you should pay closer attention to the front door and watch the people you turn away with that mentality.

{"text":"I recently had my first acupuncture session ever at Seminole Heights Community Acupuncture and I loved it. \n\nOne of the major components that I love is the model. Seminole Heights Community Acupuncture is designed to minimize cost while delivering quality care that is accessible to everyone. Cost is a huge factor of accessibility of any component of health care. \n\nThere are no private rooms. Rather, you receive the services in a community setting amongst other people. I will admit, I was a little nervous of this at first, but it was a great experience. You are seated in a chair and the acupuncturist comes to each person individually, inquired about what issues\/concerns they may be experiencing and then performs the acupuncture. It's an extremely relaxing environment. \n\nAnother thing that I love is that there is a sliding scale pay system. This means that you pay, within a set range, what you are able to pay that day. This ensures that people are more likely to continue receiving the treatment they need.\n\nThe staff are exceptional. These are individuals who truly believe in the value with these practices and work hard to ensure its accessibility to the community. I cant think of a more commendable business model.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This place is attempting to be a cross between Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, but unfortunately it doesn't quite measure up to either. However, it has some unique features that make it a valuable addition to the neighborhood, along with it's more convenient central location.\n\nPRICE COMPARISON: Whole Foods gets a bad rep for being expensive, but its 365-brand items are actually quite affordable (often less expensive w\/ better ingredients than Acme!). Trader Joe's over all has the best prices, and it's Trader Joe's brand items are both unique and well-priced. That being said, MOM's prices for grand name products and fresh produce are about the same as Whole Foods.\n\nPRODUCT SELECTION\/LAYOUT: MOM's is significantly smaller than both Whole Foods and Trader Joe's in Center City, so there definitely isn't as much volume or variety in their products. This means that if you like a certain brand of canned beans or pasta sauce or something, they might not have it. But fear not, they still have a decent variety of vegan goods and organic products - they even have a grind your own nut butter station! You should definitely be able to find everything you'd want from Whole Foods or Trader Joe's, as long as you're not picky about brand\/price. Also, the layout is spacious and it isn't nearly as crowded as Whole Foods, so it's overall a much more pleasant shopping experience. The staff is also very friendly!\n\nUNIQUE TO MOM'S: I cannot state how excited I am that MOM's offers BRING YOUR OWN CONTAINER SERVICES. I think I gaped at the soaps and screamed \"YAAAAAAAAS\" internally for at least 2 minutes. They have hand soaps, body wash, and laundry detergent available - I feel like I've been waiting FOREVER for one of these to pop up in Philly! You can also bring your own containers to purchase grains, spices, nut butters, and water. So excited to be able to reduce the amount of waste I produce and re-use all the cute little plastic containers I've been loathe to throw out all these years! Just make sure to bring all your containers to the check-out counter BEFORE you shop so that they can be pre-weighed - that way, you won't have to pay for the weight of your container.\n\nOverall, was very pleased with MOM's. I will definitely be returning to with my own containers to buy soaps, detergent, and grains - so excited a place is finally offering this service! Also, given how convenient the location is, I will definitely be stopping by for groceries when I don't feel like trekking all the way to Whole Foods or Trader Joe's.","stars":4.0}

The dressing was incredibly thick and pungent, just the way it ought to be. Next I ordered the special, a 7 oz chipotle glazed filet mignon with a baked potato. I paired the steak with a nice red blend and what a great combination! The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare and was incredibly tender. The quality of the meat was top notch and the plate came with a fruit relish, which added hint of sweetness to the meal. The waitress was on top of her game too.

Tuesday came around and I called to figure out a pick up time and the same woman laughed and said it definitely isn't done.  So I didn't get it til two days later.  It was a horrible experience.

{"text":"While I do not frequent this establishment very often, when I do, it is a pure delight.  My parents are here almost once a week so I live vicariously through them in between visits.  I remember when I was in high school it was a greasy spoon diner known as Charcoal, Steak and Things.  Now it is the gem of Yardley borough serving classy food in creative ways.  \n\nMy review will be based upon the Kitchen Tasting I enjoyed this past December 2011, but I think it will give any reader some insight on the abilities and creativity of the chefs here.  I have posted pictures to accompany this review.  \n\nFirst Course: Oyster: cherry, leek.  Before this tasting I had never had an oyster before.  I know, I know, it took me this long, but what a way to experience my first one!  We were presented with an oyster bathing in it's own juices, covered in thinly sliced leek and a cherry foam on top.  Unfortunately my experience was dominated by the flavor of the leek, but there was a subtle presence of the cherry foam and the oyster just melted away.  Impressive presentation.\n\nSecond Course: Scallop: lentil, grapefruit, frisee.  The scallop was cooked perfectly and paired well with the lentil.  I've never had lentil outside of soup so it was nice to experience it's true taste on it's own.  Paired with the scallop and frisee, there were many layers of textures ranging from soft and mushy to crisp crunch.  I should have asked the chef at the time, but I was left wondering what the purpose of the grapefruit was.  Possibly to cleanse the pallet after eating the scallop?\n\nThird Course: Woodcock: polenta, cherry, sprout leaves.  Yes, I looked up a picture of a Woodcock right after I ate this course!  It looked like a cross between a woodpecker and a pigeon.  Found year round in the southeast, breeding in the northeast, this particular bird was from New York.  It's flavor was gamey, the breast not as gamey as the thigh.  Along with the creamy polenta and the bittersweet dried cherry, this was a unique course.  I preferred the flavor of the breast to the thigh greatly.  \n\nFourth Course: Trio of Duck.  I'm sorry to those that disapprove, but duck is GOOD!  We were presented with a thick cut of duck breast with a tasty layer of fat on top, a full duck heart and deep fried duck tongue.  I was surprised that the heart was pretty tender and almost tasted like a cut of filet mignon.  The tongue were like crispy little fried clams.  It was exotic without tasting as such.  I was really impressed with how it was presented as well.  \n\nFifth Course: Hanger Steak: turnip, red wine, broccoli rabe.  Hanger Steak, a.k.a. Butcher's Steak presents itself almost like a flank steak in it's look and texture but offers great flavor.  We were given a generous portion of steak atop turnip puree and red wine reduction.  Topped with broccoli rabe and pepper flakes, this was the course more familiar to my taste buds and eyes.  After the adventure of the first four courses, this was a treat to finish the savory dishes.\n\nSixth Course: Pliable Chocolate: black sesame, meringue.  First off, look at the picture I posted and how they presented this dish.  It was awesome!  I was never a big fan of sesame but when paired with chocolate, it really redefined the flavor for me.  There was this sesame 'dust' that just disappeared in your mouth, creamy toasted meringue, black sesame ice cream and chocolate ganache.  \n\nIf you can attend a tasting here, I highly recommend it as it really exposes you to things you may never order on your own.  You don't know what your going to eat until you arrive so there is a lot of excitement involved.  The chef presents each dish with a little explanation and will answer any questions you have.  The staff here is really friendly and the view overlooking the Delaware River just adds to the already pleasant ambiance.  Awesome job done by this place!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Senae Thai is a modern and attractive spot with beautiful dishes that fall short when you eat them. I had the gaeng pak (green curry) with tofu. The curry seemed lacking in veggies - only had eggplant, zucchini, and a couple small bites of celery. Far more sauce than veggies. On top of that, the veggies seemed hardly cooked. They were still pretty crunchy. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I didn't love it. I also didn't love the heavy-handed drizzle of olive oil all over the top. This didn't feel like a classic curry. The flavor was okay, but the texture of the veggies was a letdown. The others in my group tried the drunken noodles and the chicken satay. They weren't overly impressed. The restaurant seemed understaffed, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and propose that perhaps this isn't their normal food quality. That being said, I would probably seek out a different Thai restaurant before coming back.","stars":3.0}

They will take your deposit, go silent on you for weeks, them just show up with a truck and crew.

Mike needs a class in professional communication and employee training, because the entire organization follows his clueless lead.  Wife Nancy should be fired, but Mike has no idea how bad she is because she is a product of him.  And the work is shoddy.  I hired them to grade my yard for drainage.

{"text":"I see a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews so maybe we caught this place at a bad time, but the only reason I give it even 2 stars is our waitperson Kelly was so friendly!\nI requested a simple grilled salmon meal with roasted veg and artichoke quinoa. First off, the salmon was over-cooked to complete dryness. \"Roasted\" veg ended up being zucchini boiled or steamed within an inch of its life and there was very little artichoke or flavor in the quinoa. \nAdditionally, the meal was plated in a long rectangular plate with mushy veg on 1 side and slab of dry salmon on the other... with nothing in between. A full 1\/3D of the plate was empty and quite unappealing. \nFinally, while the belly dancer was fun and the waitstaff dance was cute, I dont understand why they walk thru restaurant and throw a bundle of paper napkins up in the air. They land on the floor, making it slippery, the napkins stick to your shoes like TP, and not for nothing, but why do we need to bE creating all that unnecessary waste?  Not very PC in my mind. \nDid we just hit it on an off night for the kitchen? I don't know. But we will likely not return to test that theory.","stars":2.0}

They messed up my order once before, but were nice enough about it; however, I talked my parents into trying tonight and not only did they screw up the order, but wouldn't make it right. Only offered a minimal percentage off the next order, which Mom said wasn't going to happen (the next order), and I can't blame her. I actually called in the order, but when Dad went to pick up they tried to charge him double - mixed up orders, and when he finally got our food home it was spam instead of shrimp. None of us like spam, AND we were willing to pay for shrimp. So now we have food we won't eat, they were not willing to fix it, so having cold cereal for dinner, out of hard-earned money, and NEVER going back.

{"text":"On Ash Wednesday, I, being the good Catholic-raised girl that I am, not only forgot to get ashes and avoid meat, but also ate a giant matzah ball soup and latkes lunch. Nobody tell my Grandma. Oy vey.\n\nOn a cold winter day all I wanted was a giant bowl of soup, and Kaufman's did the trick. A friend and I stopped in around noon and it was almost empty when we walked in, but was packed by the time we left. You're greeted with a rather large bowl of cole slaw and pickles (I hate pickles, but with varying levels of pickledness, I didn't hate these! Very interesting flavors I haven't tried before). The waiter was a bit...aloof? Not super friendly and it took a few stare-downs to get his attention, but I get that the lunch rush is a pain and they're new.\n\nThe 1\/2 portion of potato pancakes was delicious- 5 small, perfectly crispy circles, with awesome apple sauce and sour cream. The Matzah Ball soup comes with one GIANT ball, surrounded by bowtie pasta, chicken, and carrots. Perfect for a cold day. Looking around, the portions are huge! Most of these are definitely a sharing or save half for dinner situation. Warning: there is a homeless guy strategically positioned outside and you will feel like a dick walking by with your takeout box. Also, watch out for the \"side orders\" my friend's bacon side cost as much as her meal and was basically a bowl of bacon!\n\nWe were in and out within an hour. $17 with tax and tip is a bit much for lunch but it's nice to be served once in a while, and the potato latkes were a great mid-afternoon snack! The cookies that come with the check are awesome yoo!\n\nRecommend for a casual lunch.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I came in at the perfect time because there was a line forming when I left. I sat at the bar and the bartender was totally awesome talking to me and recommending stuff. I had a double Hurricane and couldn't resist Mambos Famous Oysters to start. The guy charring my oysters was smiling at me as I tried them w pure pride of what he just cooked while I tried my first bite. They come hot so blow on them Bc they are straight off the fire. The rich taste of the sauce explodes on your taste buds and the bread is perfect to soak up more of the sauce. I wanted crab cakes, but knew I would order something else too so I got the crab cake pasta. The bartender asked me if I wanted to add fried Gator and I said why not \"While-in Nola.\" This is one of my favorite dishes I have ever had. It was just right. Get a piece of the crab cake, then sauce, then a noodle and let it dance on your tongue. I was dancing a jig while eating Bc I couldn't help it. The Gator was just an added bonus making this meal spectacular. The locals do not all know this place Bc it's on Bourbon Street, but my taste buds highly recommend!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The room itself was nice and everything was clean. BUT the customer service was horrible. I came in from Houston for a bachelorette party and had booked a room in advance. I checked in though the app the previous day and was told that I couldn't pick a room, that one would be assigned when I got there. I even called the hotel to confirm that everything was good to go. I show up and walk up to the desk to pickup my key after a flight delay and long taxi line. There was one man in front of me at the desk and I stood there patiently. Then two girls show up and stood next to me. I know the concierge saw me, but opted to check those girls in first. Then when it's finally my turn, she starts the whole process of checking me in. What's the point of checking in on the app if I have to redo it later? Anyways, my card gets declined for the $500 two day stay. The concierge announced it very loudly and with a sneer, like I was the mud on the bottom of her shoes. I explained to the woman that I knew for a fact my debit card had  more than enough. She ran it again, rolled her eyes, and told me loudly that it had declined again. At this point I'm nearly in tears. I opened my banking app and confirmed I had the money. But my battery was at 3% so I asked her to borrow a phone to call the bank. She yet again rolls her eyes at me and tells me to check the \"business center.\" I go over there and there's  no phone. How did she not know that? So I dig through my luggage for my cellphone charger in the middle of the lobby and call the bank. Turns out the bank thought it was a fraudulent charge because it was out of state and they told me to try again. I go back over and explain it to her. She then has the audacity to tell me that she knew that had to have been the problem because it happens a lot and finally gets me checked in. Are you kidding me? If she knew it was a banking issue, then why did she look at me like I was beneath her? She acted like I was wasting her time. I have never been so humiliated before. I generally like staying with the Hilton chain of hotels when I travel, but I don't think I will anymore.","stars":1.0}

I ordered a slice and some garlic knots while the rest of my party ordered 2 sandwiches. The waitress brought my slice and garlic knots together, then brought the other orders about 10 minutes later... She also asked if we wanted refills on our EMPTY glasses when she brought the slice, we didn't get our drinks until we were done eating our food. The place had a total of 5 patrons ( 3 at our table ). At the time they had 2 waitresses working, 1 lady working the cash register and 3 or 4 cooks.\n\nMy other complaint is when ordering over the phone for pickup. I have ordered at all times, late\/early, lunch\/dinner and have given them plenty of time to finish the order 20-30 mins before I show up and still end up waiting 20 minutes for my order. I have even tried paying by CC with hopes they would make the order before I showed up... Someone needs to teach them some urgency and they would get 4-5 stars.\n\nFood is pretty good, pizza always consistent. Stromboli's are HUGE and tasty.

It was difficult at first because you can only do headshots and it's close quarters, but it was so much fun.

We decided to go for a belated V day celebration and we were not disappointed! We had great service and a great experience all around.\n\nFor drinks, we were thrilled to find a Normandy cider on the menu. A little pricey at 18\/bottle, but it was so delicious and transported us right back to the Normandy cider route we drove. \n\nFor our meal, we decided to do the tasting menu which I highly recommend. They give you a lot of food for the price and we were full and satisfied at the end. They started us with bread and butter and a small cup of the chestnut soup with mushrooms. The soup was delicious and I could have eaten a huge bowl. Next we got escargot, which came with 4 for each of us. I was most excited for these, but was slightly underwhelmed. They were very buttery, but completely lacking in salt. We were also brought out a salad with duck confit and fois gras, beef tartare, and the mussels with a poached egg. These were all delicious. The mussels was probably the highlight of the meal- make sure you order this.\n\nFor the mains, we were given the mustard braised rabbit and the beef bourguignon. The beef was better than the rabbit, but were both good!\n\nFor dessert, we got a Mille feuille and the chocolate mousse. What a great way to end the meal!\n\nWe really enjoyed our time here and will definitely come back. Highly recommend the tasting menu as a way to sample a decent portion of the menu for a reasonable price!","stars":4.0}

Bread was so-so, pastrami was not that great - no real pastrami flavor. It was like the meat was watered down - not rich in color or flavor. Blah. And expensive. Two full size sandwiches, fries and 2 drinks - $28.  Really!?! But if it had been better meat, I would have not minded the price. Roast Beef was the same way - a bit too done for my liking. I like my roast beef medium or medium rare. I had to salt it.. Goodness!! its a Deli.. it should be salty enough!  The pickles were tasty., I loved them. The fries were probably not fresh, but well prepared and good. We were looking forward to an awesome sandwich - over the top. Not so.

I included in my reservation a note that I am pregnant and had to avoid certain things. The server greeted us with that knowledge and the answers to all my questions relating to pasteurized cheese and fully cooked meat and fish. I know I'm going to spell it wrong but her name was Keily (Keilee? Kiely?) and she really bumped up our experience with her friendliness and enthusiasm. The ambience was not as impressive has I imagined but honestly I appreciated that it's not a stuffy fancy restaurant. We were seated by the window which was lovely other than being right next to the service station where staff had to keep reaching over my husband's should for place settings. Despite this, I still can't give less than 5 stars. The food itself far exceeded my expectations - and they were high! We both agreed it was one of the greatest meals we'd each ever had. If not the very best. Some of these reviews say Zahav is overhyped. I could not disagree more strongly. My husband also really enjoyed the wine pairing and said he'd get it again.

{"text":"Since we live in the heydays of warehouse, one-stop-shopping establishments I can understand why you must be thinking, \"Ace what?\" but let me assure you, Ace Hardware is a name worth knowing. \n\nI just recently bought a house and am coming to know the joys -and dreads- of homeownership first hand. And the fact of the matter is: stuff breaks. Or even more frequently- stuff was installed wrong when it was first put in! Hence the reason for this review of a home improvement store in the first place. \n\nThe service here is spectacular. Employees practically hover around you, they greet you the moment they see you and immediately ask to help. Better yet, they're even knowledgeable about the store! Granted it's easier to keep track of 10 aisle instead of 50 (like some 'Home Lowe' stores), it nevertheless helps immensely to have the sales persons take the time to show you where to find exactly what you need when you don't even know what you're looking for- AND be cheerful about it! \n\nAnother impressive feature of the store is the ability to buy individual items. Just need one screw? Or a single O-ring (aka 'gasket', aka 'rubber ring for pipes') ?  You can buy that here! Before I knew better, I was spending $5 dollars a pop for a box of screws when I only needed 3! Had I known about Ace, I'd only be out a buck-o-five!\n\nThey have a pretty good selection for a small store. True, they're not a warehouse store but unless you're a contractor building a house from scratch that won't matter much. And of course the price can't be beaten. \n\nI highly recommend Ace Hardware to any noob home-improvers needing single serve hardware, guidance and prices that won't scare the wallet off of you.","stars":5.0}

Less than a week later, the paint is even peeling on 6 of the nails without me doing any dishwashing, etc. \n\nTOTALLY DISAPPOINTED, will not be coming back.

(clearly new to yelp because I thought I was writing a review and wrote a tip instead) \n\nI love this place in pretty much every aspect. The bar is gorgeous! Love the wood and the beer taps are unlike many I have seen. Very classy. Yes, classy beer taps. I realize what I am saying. \n\nWe started with the Mac and Cheese, chicken and dumplings and mackerel. The mackerel was my favorite. Very simple in design but an explosion of taste. Only bummer was my husband ordered it and he ate most of it. \n\nFor dinner I had the quail and my husband had the short rib. We were kind enough to give each other one taste and then we didn't share after that. The quail was outstanding. Sitting in lentils and beets and stuffed. A chef I am not so not quite sure how he accomplished what he did but it was real good. \n\nFinally the desserts. I have to say the salted Carmel chocolate cake was so good it overshadowed the other dessert. Next time we are ordering two so we don't have to share! I encourage you to do the same. \n\nI am already looking forward to my next visit...","stars":5.0}

I had no pain during the procedure and he gave me more localized anesthesia when leaving because I won't take pain medication (opiates). \n\nAlso, he stayed till 7pm on a Friday to help me out and did a good job getting into the core of my root problem with less invasive techniques that only an endo can do.\n\nIf you need a root canal this is the person to go to in Reno, bed side manner is amazing and the nurses were so dedicated and kind.","stars":5.0}

Now I'm just angry that it took me so long to eat here. I have so much time to make up for!! Too much delicious food, not enough time! \n\nSeriously though, this place is fantastic.  The patio with the fire pits looks awesome. I can imagine cuddling up there on a chilly night, or enjoying it in the summer watching people pass by on the Monon. What I'm saying is it's a good location and a neat atmosphere. \n\nFood.Fresh. Good. Yes! I ordered the pimento grilled cheese and the Thai vegetables.  Both were excellent. I also tried a bite of Brittany S.'s veggie chili which was also delicious.  I was salivating over just looking at their desserts too. Everything that I tried was so fresh and flavorful, and even though I ordered a not-so-healthy grilled cheese, I didn't feel gross after eating it like I normally do.  Also, what a great mission Public Greens is... to feed wholesome, real food to underserved kiddos within our own community. There's nothing better than that.\n\nIf you haven't been here yet (like me as of yesterday), then do yourself a favor and head there immediately!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Maybe the large \"For Rent\" sign next door was a symbol of what was to come, but I did not think of that on the way in.  I came down to Levittown to try Zhou's House based on Yelp reviews, and the fact that I eat Chinese food as often as I can and am always looking for alternative shops to try. \n\nThe space itself is nice.  It is bright, clean and comfortable.  The family operation is friendly enough and they take pride in maintaining a pleasant environment.  I stopped in for lunch around 2:00 and was the only customer.  As is my habit, the first time I visit a resto I order something standard off the menu that is available at every Chinese shop in the West for easy comparison.  This day it was General's Chicken, Fried Rice and an Egg Roll for $6.95.\n\nAll looked good when the large plate arrived at my table.  The colors, shapes and textures seemed right.  The aroma was nice.  Sadly, the positives ended with the atmospheric effects.  The Chicken was wrapped in a thick bready coating that hardened like a shell around a too small core of meat.  Not only could I not taste the chicken, but I could not even feel it in my mouth while chewing.  It was all bun\/no beef.  The sauce was a thick goo, lacking in finesse and any heat quotient. All corn starch, little spice.  The Egg Roll tasted of stale cooking oil, and the Fried Rice was bland. Clearly, this was an empty dish designed to provide a full plate without substance at a lunch specials price. Feh!\n\nIt could be that the dinners at Zhou's are far better than the lunch menu, but I will never know.  Any restaurant willing to dish out the slop given me for lunch, is not one I would chance for dinner.","stars":1.0}

The pate sucree is perfectly short, and the lemon cream silky and smooth. The vanilla bean sour cherry cheese cake is also a must try. The cake itself has a mousse like texture and the cherries really help to balance out the sweetness. If you're looking for something savoury, I always enjoy the Parmesan and prosciutto croissant. Extremely buttery and flaky, as all laminated pastries should be.\n\nThe shop itself is very simple and chic. Small, yet inviting.

The panchan was also excellent - kimchi, bean sprouts, tofu, etc.  \n\nThey also use this neat type of infrared grill from Korea.  I've always been partial to real charcoal, so I was naturally skeptical.  But this grill not only gets very hot, but for whatever reason, the grill doesn't generate nearly as much smoke as a typical charcoal or gas grill.  I have no idea how it works, but the smoke rarely rose above eye level and the restaurant doesn't have the smokey smell Korean restaurants typically have.\n\nThe service was also great.  The waiters are actually trained to clean the grill after what seemed like every serving of BBQ so that the meat doesn't get that black crusty stuff.\n\nWe will definitely be back!","stars":5.0}

Spicy, saucy, great tasting wings. Messy and got all over the place, but that's how wings should be.\n\nIf you ever want to just kick back, watch sports, drink a beer and stuff your face with massive amounts of food...

You will not have to wait a long time for your food to be ready. Pizzas are good, tomato pies are good, cheesesteaks are solid. They've recently added Gyros to the menu, and I am a fan. They offer an extensive menu. \"Ralph's Famous Fries\" is one of my go to appetizers, whiz and garlicky sauce. It cannot be beat for $2.50. I've been going here for years.

For food, I ordered the half order of raw oysters and the gumbo. They both were incredibly delicious and perfectly seasoned. The seafood was clearly very fresh.

There was a sign that said ring bell to order which I did and waited (when I was already late for my movie) and no one came. There was no sign anywhere with their hours to make sure people don't waste their time. I went to the concessions counter after and there were no options that were appropriate for lunch.

{"text":"I have just moved out of the Dwell Luxury Apartments after being there a year. This was due to the fact I recently purchased a home. However, I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. It is an excellent maintained property with manicured grounds, upscale kitchens and bathrooms. The apartments are configured in the buildings in such a way that they are very quiet. I never heard a neighbor since the apartments are not clustered close to each other. The complex is ideally located near all major highways, all types of shopping, recreation and more restaurants than anyone could visit in a lifetime in Cherry Hill. The maintenance calls were handled promptly by the staff although there were not many since the complex is fairly new. The on site management was great especially Blair and the manager Joshua. They were attentive in finding lease options that fit your individual situation. It is a higher price complex befitting \"Luxury\" in name.

{"text":"I have lived in the Manayunk\/Roxborough area for over 7 years and this was BY FAR the worst dining experience I've had in the area, maybe even of my life.  My wife and I got to the restaurant around 7:15 on a Tuesday, and were immediately told by the hostess that there was no outdoor seating and only indoor was available.  That was completely fine, as we are both vaccinated, however my wife noticed that there were a few tables that were about to leave outside; the hostess could have asked if we wanted to wait a few minutes for an outdoor table, which we would have preferred, but neglected to do so. But that's only the tip of the crap iceberg here.  \n\nWe took our seats and got our menus.  We didn't drink anything besides water that night, and put our order in quickly-maybe we should have ordered a beer or two, would have made the time go by quicker; I ordered the pork loin sandwich with cucumber slaw and my wife ordered their umami burger with mushrooms, bacon and egg.  We waited. And waited. And waited. The couple behind us got served. Still we waited.  It was relatively busy for a Tuesday but not overwhelming as they did not seem understaffed.\n\n45 minutes later we FINALLY get our orders although they were NOT our orders.  My wife got a turkey burger (they offer beef, turkey or plant-based burgers) and no bacon.  She was fine with it and didn't want to make a fuss because, as she said, it's healthier.  Either way, she didn't get what she ordered. Now, onto my entree...\n\nI got what looked to be a very sad looking steak sandwich with what looked like barbecue sauce on it.  I asked our server (who is also the bartender) about my sandwich, which was supposed to have some type of slaw and aioli on it.  He took my food back and came back and told me they gave me a cheesesteak (which looked pretty bare based on what I remember the cheesesteak was supposed to come with, condiment-wise).  I finally get my sandwich, which was decent enough but the meat to bread ratio was way off.  The cucumber \"slaw\" was just sliced up cucumbers.  After the meal we waited another 15 or 20 minutes for our server to come give us the check (he wasn't super busy as I noticed he was on his cell phone multiple times). \n\nWe will NEVER be coming back here.  It's a shame too, as a local leader of one of the bigger area social groups that goes to local bars weekly, almost exclusively on Main St, we will not be including them and giving them our business in the future because of this awful experience.","stars":1.0}

We came here on a Sunday evening for dinner, we didn't make reservations and they had just had a rush come in but luckily they seated us at the last table they had available. \n\nWe chose to skip starters as bread was enough for us - plus the entrees come with a salad. So we jumped right into ordering - I had a ceasar salad and the shrimp scampi. The ceasar was great, wonderful dressing and tasty flavor. The shrimp scampi on the other hand was just ok to be honest, I think they must have been swamped in the kitchen cause the shrimp was overdone and mushy, and the breading\/garlic flavor on the shrimp didn't taste cooked fully. All this being said, it did have a lot of flavor just probably needed to be cooked better.\n\nWe were celebrating a birthday and I mentioned this to a waiter on the way to the restroom. I was surprised they brought dessert out on the house, while we were still deciding what to order for dessert! Luckily they read our minds, and gave us a cheesecake - it was so good!

Fresh pesto, chicken, mozzerella, and tomatoes. The hubs ordered a pizza with several different meat choices including pepperoni and sausage and a hearty red sauce. He also ordered a strawberry milkshake that was really good. Nice and thick and not overly sweet. The pizza crust was nice and thin and handled the toppings nicely. $21 for two custom made pizzas and a drink and a milkshake is super affordable. I am sure I will be stopping  by this place weekly. It's clean, the service was fast and excellent and the pizza was really good. If you haven't checked this place out, what are you waiting for?!","stars":5.0}

Rebecca checked us in at the front desk where she made us feel very welcome and she explained all of the amenities. She was extremely kind, professional, and helpful. Our room was super clean and the complimentary breakfast was on point. The best part is that the hotel is pet friendly. Our two cats felt right at ease and relaxed in the room. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.","stars":5.0}

It's a white\/red wine of the day and a cocktail of the day.  If you like one of the 'of the day' specials it's great value otherwise just standard bar pricing.  Food came fairly fast. I really liked the chicken bao bun but my friend rice was average.  It's always fun to check out somewhere new and I liked my early evening spent there.

{"text":"I took my son, 3 of his kids, my daughter, son in law, their son and husband to this restaurant yesterday   Worse service ever experienced!  The waitress would come to the table saying it seemed like everyone needed refills when she came to the table.  Ordered 4 Bang Bang, 2 Calamari, 1 crab cake and she brought out 3 shrimp, then a little while another, then a little while another.  We were jammed into a table and there were tables empty our entire visit.  She forgot bread\/oil then after we were getting our meals asked if we wanted it.  My sons meal came after the rest of us were well into our meals.   We had to ask for a desert menu.  She comped 2 deserts acknowledging some mistakes but then when we ordered more than 2 deserts git excited and wanted to be sure we knew only 2 were comped.  One kid order was wrong.  Then the bill was wrong.   I love Bone Fish but while food was great the service ruined it.","stars":1.0}

We were the only ones there at about 10pm on a Saturday. \nIt should tell you a lot though, just knowing that the people that own\/run the place thought it was a good idea to change the name back to Murphy's before their episode even aired on TV.

{"text":"Louis re-glazed my tub in the hall bathroom.  I had to call him back to clean up because there was overspray everywhere.  To be honest, he was very responsive and came back to clean up.  After that, though, when I was putting everything back together (after the required 48 hours had passed), I noticed that the actual glazing job was a mess.  There were some rough patches, where I know it will start to peel.  Also, along the inside tub wall, the entire side is one line of dripping glaze.  It looks like a bad paint job where you put too much paint on the wall and it drips.  It looks like an amateur job.  I called Louis to tell him about it.  That was a week ago and I have not heard from him.  I have been blown off.  The only thing that would satisfy me now is a complete refund since I now have to call someone else to come in and re-do this.  DON'T use Grout King for reglazing.

Rice - Looked presentable but undercooked.  Salsa - it's actually just pico!\n\nChimichanga - lack of flavor, big blob of meat inside.  \n\nWater - at least you can chill it or add lemon.\n\nCheese - they only have this white cheese, it starts with a \"C\".  Seriously, it's feels like rubber and makes funny noises as you are chewing it, that's weird.  How about adding some cheddar or is that to old school?  \n\nAmenities\nDo you  not have salt shakers at the table, or do I have to ask for that as well?\nHow about a nice candle on the table?\nHow about a tablet so I can call my server instead of wondering if she sees me (I need something)?\nHow about putting curtain on the kitchen window - I don't want to see your cooks.  \nOrlando location has a live DJ, prices commensurate with some added service there.\n\n\nService:\nLack of enthusiasm, attitude sucks, while price is high.\n\nRecommendation:  How about hiring some older folks, it seems like you have a bunch of teens and 20 somethings, and it shows.  \n\nDrinks: \nSee \"Price\"\n\nIn this case, the old adage \" you get what you pay for\" doesn't exist, here. It's good for those that want to pay big bucks for bland flavor.\n\nI will never come back- ever.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I had a craving for something different and wanted something on the healthy side, so I decided to try Balkan Express.  They did not disappoint!  Here's what I had:\n\n1.  Beet Salad - Refreshing and simple.  Had a vinegar\/sour tinge which was delightful. Reminded me of the pickled beets that my Slovak Grandmother used to can back in SW Pennsylvania.\n\n2.  Sarma - These are cabbage rolls. Again, reminded me of the classic SW PA version, but with a much more fragrant variety of spices and without the soak in tomato sauce. Different, but very good. Also contained some cubed potatoes.\n\n3. Raznjici (chicken variety) - Excellent chicken skewers.  Grilled, juicy, and full of flavor.  I believe they used chicken thighs, which I always prefer over the breast.  They came with some tasty rice and a savory vegetable medley that seemed to have mashed-beans as a base.\n\nI think this place has something for everyone, including the adventurous eater or the conservative diner.  I also met the couple who runs the place and they were super sweet.  Give this place a try...you'll love it!","stars":5.0}

At this point, I'm randomly picking places based on suggestions from people I've been meeting, and this was one of them.\n\nI had the portobello mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. It was incredibly delicious. It had a marinated and grilled portobello mushroom with fresh mozzarella, tomato and greens. I couldn't get enough of the sweet potato fries and that yummy dipping sauce they come with. I was definitely disappointed when I had eaten all of them.\n\nFor dessert, I shared a piece of flour-less chili chocolate cake. I've had the combination of chocolate and chili powder before, and I knew what to expect. However, there was just a little too much chili powder on this dessert, and towards the end it felt like a challenge to finish it. Next time I'll go sans chili powder.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the drink service. I spent over 15 minutes waiting for a Cucumber Smash (gin, St. Germain, lime, muddled basil, cucumber) even though I was sitting at the bar. The bartender made some woman's drink before mine, even though I had ordered before she even stepped foot in the restaurant.

{"text":"Starting off, I've been coming here on a semi regular basis; about two times a month for the past two years. They may not know my name but they recognize me.\n\nUp until now my only complaint would be sometimes they are slow.\n\nBut here are two things that made me stop going here Forever.\n\nA few weeks ago I came in there were three nail techs, and I was the only one waiting for a mani pedi. I sat patiently for about 35 mins since they were all occupied.nat about 40 mins, another woman walks in, and gets taken immediately because she had an appointment.  That's not a problem If a: they gave me an estimated wait time or B: told me that there was an appointment coming in soon!  They literally let me sign in, sit down, said NOTHING to me for 40 mins other than \"she had an appointment\".\n\nSo I just left. \n\nThe last straw is today. I went in to have my tips removed, that I had gotten done there 3 weeks ago. The previous time i Got tips removed here, itwas fast and I got a manicure.\nToday they wanted to soak it off. Which I hate because it takes forever, dries my skin and weakens the nail. The nail tech half heartedly tries to remove Acrylic nails with A PLASTIC TIP!!!! Shes taking her sweet time, removes 3 nails, then decides I MUST soak it off, because they are fresh. They are absolutely not fresh. I got these done before my wedding over 3 weeks ago.\n\nAnyways halfway through the soaking and her looking at her phone and I pad, I ask if she can just do a top coat, because it's taking too long,\n\nWhen I go up to pay, they tried to tell me it was 15!!!!!! I didn't even get a manicure, the nails were never fully removed, and I got one effing coat! In their own menu it says 5$ for removal! I explain this, and get told WITH attitude, that it's only 5 if you get a new set. Which by the way makes absolutely no sense, why someone would pay 5 dollars, spend an extra 40 mins, just to start the whole process over!!\n\nFinally I paid 10, which I think it still over charging. \n\nThis is not the first time, because I also got over charged for having two nail designs on a gel manicure. I was already paying for the gel manicure, but he design apparently costs more.....since its gel.....which I'm already paying for...so they charged me 50 dollars for two measly designs on a 30 dollar service.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"TL:DR - Extremely hospitable service. JJ Noodles = $11.50 shin ramen with dumplings. Good food despite the upcharge. Kheer is a must get dessert.\n\nThis review is for the dinner service.\n\nI've been here for lunch several times, but it's a lunch buffet, it is what it is. First time in for dinner for a friend's birthday, and it was a very solid, but unspectacular experience. I ended up ordering JJ's noodles which were noodles, 4 momo dumplings, and a hard boiled egg. My partner also got an order of pork momo's. For me, the one gripe I had was that the noodles tasted exactly like packaged Shin Ramen. I mean I love the stuff,  but I don't really want to pay $11.50 for $1.50 ramen. It's like those Chinese take out places that charge you $5 for frozen pot stickers I make at home. Going beyond the fact that they upcharged me for packaged ramen, the momo's tasted very authentic. While they look like shanghai soup dumplings, they very much had a similar taste in regards to spices to what I expect from Nepalese food, in that this pork dumpling didn't just taste like plain old pork. The dipping sauce they gave you wasn't my favorite, some spice in there had an interesting bite at the end that wasn't my cup of tea.\n\nFor dessert, I ended on Kheer, which is always a go to for me whenever I see it on the menu, and this place does it WELL!! Def recommend.\n\nOutside of that, we had a large party of 12 tonight, and the server did an amazing job and was very accommodating. Two things to note really quick, they don't let big parties use more than 4 cards total, so if you have 6 different people, two will need to pay cash, annoying, but fine.

{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE WITH A BUSINESS IN MY LIFE!!! My next step is to contact www.bbb.org. The headquarters is in Georgia, and they had 721 complaints last year overall. BUT IT SHOWS THEY DO DEAL WITH THE COMPLAINTS AND RESOLVE ISSUES.\n\nI contacted sales to set up my first water delivery experience. I thought it went well, until no one was contacting me for delivery or could give me a day and time. I was referred to the Customer Service Dept and left two messages for them to contact the local business and delivery driver so I can know when they'll be coming. I was told by the 2nd representative that my first message was never even sent. EVERY SINGLE TIME  I SPOKE TO ANYONE IN ANY DEPT I let them know this water delivery was not just convenience, it was a necessity. I was still recovering from ankle surgery and couldn't lift cases of water and my friend just had a knee replacement. Things finally calmed down a little when I spoke to Russ, the delivery guy, but even he couldn't give me a straight answer for delivery for a bit. Eventually I got my order. Things continued to go wrong. And though I said I've never experienced water delivery before, and though I mentioned to everyone I've ever spoken to that I can't carry bottles, the next delivery with the incorrect amount was left on the porch. I received an automated message the day before, but couldn't get a hold of Russ to find out when I had to be there or what. NO ONE EXPLAINED ANYTHING TO ME even though I made it clear I've never had this. I had to roll 5 of the 5 gallon bottle in on a bum ankle where my bones weren't even healed. Also, no one could tell me how to pay my bill. Customer service said pay delivery. The alternate delivery guy said I'll get an email. When the Sparkletts survey was emailed to me, I had plenty to say. And the supervisor, John, called me regarding the survey. He did tell me how to set up an account and pay my bill. He was available the few times I called. I wanted to cancel the services, my friend and I can't carry the bottles at this time, as stated TO EVERYONE. I paid my bill, John had Russ contact me with a pick-up date. Russ never showed. I left 11 bottles and that machine on the porch in the windy and stormy area my friend lives in, and I'm back home in Cali. Russ never showed at the time he said he'd pick it up, nor has he called about it. Those bottles and cooler have taken up my friend's porch for the last 9 days. AND EVEN THOUGH I CANCELED SERVICE I JUST RECEIVED AN EMAIL WITH A NEW BILL. \n\nThis place is so frustrating and sales, customer service, and local Sparkletts don't communicate with each other and contradict each other constantly.

Strangely I didn't order the super grouper sandwich which ordering a steak since I was having enough of seafood especially grouper I guess I got group without too easily but it's good to order that the sirloin steak I had with mushrooms was very good must be funny because of the fact that I'm ordering steak at a seafood restaurant.

This was a good choice and very delicious. \n\nOverall this place is a winner and close to all the sporting events.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"What can I say about Justin and JAS Productions? I could say he was wonderful. I could say he's the best DJ around. Those things are true but it feels like we're not doing him justice! \n\nPrior to my wedding, Justin was always available via phone and email for big questions and small ones, really easing our minds in the stressful wedding planning time. We performed a medley at the wedding and Justin quickly and without hesitation helped us cut together a backing track for it. It was clear from the get-go that Justin wanted to make sure that our wedding was perfect and that he'd do anything to make sure our vision was realized.\n\nOn our actual wedding day, Justin was early and was ready to go. His sound equipment was top-notch and Justin even read a speech for our grand entrance that was just incredible (he had even practiced it beforehand to time it with musical cues!). Countless guests came up to us complimenting him because he's an actual DJ who knows music, beat matching, reading crowds, you name it.\n\nSumming up: Justin was so easy to work with, is extremely talented and should be your choice for your next event!\n\nThank you Justin!!!!","stars":5.0}

I ordered the spicy cucumber appetizer and the spicy beef noodle spice with a specification of slightly spicy. The food, especially the cucumber s tasted great. Nothing was super spicy. The food was flavorful. I had some reservations about the soup. It was a bit too salty, the noodles were overcooked a bit, not enough beef, and I found a tiny hair in it. I didn't let the hair bother me . To me I just thought that maybe the cook wasnt wearing a hair net. I would come back but not for the soup. Perhaps the owner should go to the nearby restaurant and SpiceC and try their beef soup in order to see how to better prepare and portion the soup. Also, tea kettles instead of a full cup of tea might be a good investment since my tea got cokd really quickly. But all in all, thank you for the hospitality and comfort food","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I wanted to do dinner at the Varsity Club Restaurant on the Club Level before the Bulls game last night - I would have given the experience a 5 star with one exception. \n\nThe Banker's Life Fieldhouse website is NOT very user friendly.  The links work, it's easy to find, etc. but they have a huge amount of information under the \"Fan Guide\" tab that seems to have no rhyme or reason to it - it took a lot of hunting to figure out who to call to get a reservation and to figure out the name of the restaurant in the Fieldhouse that we were trying to get into.\n\nOther than that, our experience was great!  The woman who was working security at the Pacers gift shop entrance was animated, happy and welcoming - like she was actually having fun with doing the whole security thing - it sounds silly but it took something invasive and made it into a positive experience - it's great when people have a fun attitude towards their work - especially when the \"work\" is dealing with a crush of humanity eager to get inside and out of the cold!\n\nThe dinner at the Varsity Club (which is a buffet) was expensive, but the offerings were varied and there was definitely something there for just about every taste palate.  I enjoyed everything I sampled with one exception, a grilled chicken dish that was a little overcooked - dried out.  Everything else was great - we had a great waiter and AMAZING seats looking over the rail.  Being able to have dinner and watch the game at the same time was a lot of fun.  We decided to stay and watch the entire first half from the rail - it was an experience that we'll definitely try again - I'd recommend it!","stars":4.0}

As fate had it, I ended up planning a trip to Nashville and knew that I needed to make a stop here. \n\nIt's important to note that this isn't a place that you can just stop by and grab a meal. You need to pre-book ahead of time. This is done similar to booking a ticket for a concert online. You pre-pay ahead of time for the meal and gratuities (if you choose to go with the wine tasting or a drink, they will present you will an additional bill at the end of the meal).\n\nWhat made this experience so special was the staff. Upon arriving in time for our reservation, we had to wait 10 minutes before we were escorted up in an elevator to the dining area (later on I figured out that they escorted all of the parties up at different times to help better accommodate the serving times for each). Throughout the meal the chefs would bring over the food and explain what was in it. They were all super friendly and so receptive to any questions you may have. I also appreciated the fact that this restaurant was more casual and not pretentious at all, even with its hefty price tag. \n\nThe food. Well each and every dish was so careful made and prepared. It was interesting sitting around the kitchen and seeing them prepare these masterpieces. Each dish was small, but filling. The fact that they were spaced apart so perfectly made the meal even better in my eyes. Everything from the first starter to the last dessert was carefully planned and executed well. \n\nThis was an experience that I will truly remember for the rest of my life. Being able to have a great dinner with my friends made all the much better too. I would definitely recommend trying to make a reservation for the Catbird Seat if you can. It's truly a unique experience unparalleled to any other dining experience I have had.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"A long, long time ago in a St. Louis that seems far, far away from what it is now, my girlfriend (now fiance) and I were at a friend's party preparing for our first experience here. In our conversation with the host's friend (former editor of social media, I believe, of Sauce Magazine), she asked where we were heading to eat. Upon revealing that we had reservations at Trattoria Marcella, she responded with a really serious, \"Oh, you are really going to enjoy it.\" Sigh. What can be said about Trattoria Marcella? From the atmosphere to the food, it really is a great place to dine. \n\nFor the first visit, we indulged in their toasted ravioli to start. Had people of other states or cities been able to know what we were eating, they would have rued the bad fortune which had afflicted them with living so far away. These plump, meat-filled raviolis are awesome. Had I any less appreciation for a long-lived life and the respect of my special lady, I would have gorged on them until my stomach burst. Nevertheless, what was to come would further justify not doing so. At this time, they were serving a gnocchi dish with pork shoulder, which has since been removed (the world became a little darker because of it). In 30+ years of life, I cannot remember eating any Italian cuisine which had been made so perfectly. Everything, from the preparation of the meat to the use of salt was outstanding. April chose the cannelloni for her meal and, despite the feeling that it had a little too much cheese (she's not a huge fan of cheese), she thought it tasted great too. \n\nA year plus after our first visit, I took my dad here before he passed away. He was in town from Lincoln, NE and he was looking for a good dinner. He had previously been to Maggiano's for his last good Italian diner (another good establishment), but had never tried Trattoria Marcella. We started with the bread and hummus they had out and he enjoyed it; this is significant because he does not normally like hummus. We also shared an order of the toasted ravioli as an appetizer, which, much like the first visit, was amazing. For the meal, he chose the very same cannelloni dish that April ordered and, being a huge friend of cheese, he not only enjoyed it mightily, but held that it was the best Italian food he's ever had. On a side note, having seen that they had drinks with absinthe (formerly illegal in the U.S.), I endeavored to try it. Have not found any establishments outside of Trattoria Marcella that served absinthe and, despite not having a huge taste for alcohol anymore, I had to try this spirit. \n\nIt has been about seven months since I have been here, but both times, separated by a year or more, have been consistently delicious. This really is a great restaurant and, best of all, it will not wreck your wallet when compared to the likes of the epically awesome Niche or Mango.","stars":5.0}

They are like statues who's eyes only move. It's is creepy to walk pass someone, make eye contact and still no hello, wave, or smile.","stars":4.0}

Barber repeatedly nicked my face. He left the blood to dry, never cleaning it or informing me of it. Realized I had been walking down Main Street with patches of dried blood across my face only after I glanced at the vanity mirror in the car. Noticed then too that he had missed most of the cut hair when he brushed off my face.\n\nI don't think I'm wrong in expecting that a professional shave should result in minimal nicks and bleeding, and that a barber who takes pride in his profession should want his clients leaving the establishment looking better than when they walked it.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Place was simply ok. Definitely very pricey for lunch. Sushi rolls lacked some flavor. They were ok, but nothing to remember really. I got the flaming dragon roll which was a really cool presentation, because the sauce was flaming blue when it came out, but the sauce was really sweet and the sushi roll itself needed more punch. I also ordered another roll that I cant really remember what it was called, but it had lobster tempura in it. Again it was decent, but for 15 bucks a roll, I was expecting a lot more. I am new to the area of Ardmore, but I suspect there are better sushi restaurants than this.","stars":2.0}

The stirfry was cold, as in \"still felt like it was in the refrigerator\" cold. The service is very inconsistent and I've had better experiences at other locations.

{"text":"I first eyed this French restaurant about 2 days ago and decided to dine there tonight.  I made reservations and arrived about 10 minutes before.  I was asked to wait and did so, no big problem. \n\nI ordered the salmon tar tar and it was great, amazing and out of this world.  It had cucumbers, iced lettuce and watermelon radish. I ordered a white Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 as we were having seafood. A good choice, but the menu is heavy on reds.  \n\nMy daughter ordered the French onion soup and it was served in the brown\/beige bowl and not the white lion handle traditional French white bowl.  Not a major difference like whether  it is a Parisian vs Lyonnaise recipe.  \nI opted for the mulles and frittes.  First observation, it did not come in the de rigor metal pot but rather a soup bowl.   I was more than 2\/3 through when I came across a semi raw mussel.  Now mind you I have had this dish at least 2 dozen times from miami to Brussels to of course Paris.  I had never had a semi raw mussel. My side fries were overly salted.  However the homemade mayonnaise was spot on; I could taste the egg yolk and mustard.  It was definitely home made. \n\nAs for my wine cup it sat empty for awhile until the first refill.  Thereafter it was filled regularly.  \n\nOverall with a tab approaching 300 I was disappointed.  \nService: lackluster, improved as the night wore on. \nParking: side parking. \nFood: average, hit or miss and the semi cooked mussel a culinary faux pas.","stars":3.0}

It wasn't especially clean, the selection wasn't all that, and the produce was minimal.  I guess I had it pretty good with Tienda Morales in my old hood.\n\nI don't like that it's attached to a gas station either.  Maybe I'm biased against cars and gas and such, but so what. - it definitely affects my experience.\n\nIF I decide to try them again sometime in the future I will definitely be calling ahead and getting my order to go.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I would like to heed my only warning - SAVE YOUR RECEIPTS. I got accused of running out of my bill because the cashier at the front threw away my paper from grooming and pocketed my $80. Several phone calls, security footage and no apology later, I was proved innocent but it was 25% my fault for not saving\/getting the receipt for the payment. I like this place so here's all the reasons you should go:\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that I come to this PetSmart every four weeks as they have done the best job keeping my dog's cost manageable. I have a malamute mix and the ONLY way to make it through is getting him Furminated, often. I give PetSmart one star just for offering this treatment. I have tried to go to other groomers who do not offer the name brand Furminator treatment and tools but a \"de-shed\" alternative, and it is not the same. I'm handing out the next star for their prices. De-shedding treatments are incredibly expensive and it seems as though my favorite groomers at our local petsmart grooming department do a better job than anyone else I've ever visited for a whole lot less. I'm going to give another star for the employees. They are good to my dog, they are respectful of me, and they do well in keeping a facility full of animals clean. Im giving my fourth and final star for the quality of the facility. This petsmart is big. They have a vast food section, beds, collars, numerous toys for all kinds of animals, and several other things. There is very few dog related items I could need that I can't find here. It is an all-in-one for anyone who is willing to compromise a little with \"name brand\" fronts. The quality is good in my opinion. Not only with the groomers, but I also take my dog to do indoor play time when it is far too hot for a malamute to run. He loves running and playing with his friends, and it's a nice air-conditioned alternative to sitting at home or overheating in the yard. It's also a nice peace of mind to know that between the dog daycare and the grooming facility, there is a vets office if my dog was to ever be hurt or sick while in their care.","stars":4.0}

On a positive note, the ricotta pancakes and chirizo con papas were very good.  \n\nIn the end, the waiter was less than helpful, the food was tasty  but a bit monotonous and overpriced.  \n\nI would return to try the famous suckling pig but for now i was left a bit disappointed.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I worked with Bailey (hair) and Gloria (make-up) from La Di Da Beauty on my wedding day. Throughout the planning process, Kenzie was our point of contact for scheduling my trials, collecting feedback, and setting up our day-of hair and makeup timeline.\n\nI went in for my first hair and make-up trial months before the wedding date, with plans to head straight to our engagement photos afterwards. The \"bridal bar\" in Reno is super cute and they were very welcoming as I entered for my appointment. Bailey looked through my inspiration and reference photos and designed a loose braid that achieved my romantic vision perfectly. For my make-up, Gloria was very receptive to my Pinterest board (which was, admittedly, all over the place) and stayed over my appointment end time as we tried tweaking a few different things.\n\nAfter the trials, Kenzie collected my feedback and I expressed some issues I had with my make-up and false lashes during the engagement shoot. Gloria was so nice as to offer me a second trial so that we could try to get it right and put my mind at ease leading up to the wedding date. By this point, I think I had a clearer idea of what I wanted, and she was able to nail it perfectly at my second appointment!\n\nOn my wedding day, they came on-site extremely early in the morning to start setting up. With me, my two bridesmaids, and four VIPs, this meant that they had a very long day without much breaks in-between. I really appreciated how upbeat they were the entire time and we actually ended ahead of schedule. Bailey and Gloria were so patient as many of us have never had had our hair and make-up done professionally before. Everyone loved their look and they really made our \"getting ready\" phase a wonderful experience!\n\nI would use Bailey and Gloria both again in a heartbeat for my hair and make-up needs! You couldn't be in better hands on your wedding day (And if I lived closer, I definitely would seek out La Di Da Beauty for their other services.)","stars":5.0}

The closest thing you can get here is udon. \n\nWe shared the sashimi, tempura and a couple of maki rolls. My favorite was the \"crispy paradise\" roll which is similar to a regular California roll but with mango stuffed inside and a sweet mayo sauce drizzled on top. Delicious!

Everything about their cheesesteaks are so so good!  The bread they use is excellent quality and doesn't get soggy, even after a two hour car ride back to Maryland.  My typical toppings are American cheese, cheese whiz, fried onions, and mayonnaise.  The amount of meat they give you is plentiful and it's not gritty at all.  There's no need to put a lot of toppings on your sub because the meat itself is juicy and flavorful.  In addition to traditional cheesesteaks, they also have chicken cheesesteaks, hoagies, burgers, salads, and desserts.  They don't have french fries, but they do have chips.  They also have a good selection of soft drinks and beers.\n\nThis place is always bustling, but the staff members are fast and efficient.  It's small on the inside, but there are some bar stools and a counter to your immediate right if you want to dine in.  There is also some outside seating available.  This restaurant only takes cash; there is an ATM by the entrance if you need to withdraw some money.  Most of the items on the menu are under $10.\n\nThis place appears to attract a good mix of locals and tourists.

Thought they would trick me with this foul act of deception!!! I already paid for it when the driver first showed and when he spoke to the owner on the phone in front of me he spoke in Italian. Should have known what was going on right then! However I have been a loyal customer for 15 years and never expected this!! The owner Frank got on the phone with me and hollered at me and cussed me out!! Instead of making it right he sent the driver back to collect the horrible cold pizza and give me my money back !!

We're waiting in line and I guess it turns out we were waiting in the wrong line, which was customer service, and the lady in the front named Claudia, told us we had to move to the other line for regular check-out. For once, there was no one else in either line besides us, after we moved we saw her whisper something to the customer she was helping. We patiently waited until someone else was willing to help, then the same lady \"oh I can help whoever is next\" and apparently she was talking to us, so she made us move for no reason and had the audacity to talk about us?

{"text":"MBN provided me with the absolute \"worst\" car-buying experience of my entire life. I saw a car online that I was interested in, so I contacted the dealership and made an appointment with a salesman. I test drove the car, talked over some numbers with the salesman and agreed to apply for financing. I was told I had the income, credit score and down payment to submit a credit application. Two days later, my mom and I visited the dealer with my trade, and my down payment. They were extremely busy that day, but my mom and  I were patient. My salesman suggested that I leave and come back a later on in the day because they were experiencing some tech issues. I did exactly that. \n\nWhen I returned my sales lady was closing the deal with another customer so I ended up waiting for about two more hours. When it was my turn, I was told that I'd been approved but I needed more money down. I asked them what were the terms of the loan and I was again told that I needed more money down. They refused to disclose any of the details regarding the financing. I decided to leave. Initially I was upset but I really wanted the car. The next day my dad and I returned to see if we could negotiate a deal that I'd be satisfied with. We offered to place more money down to get me the car. They accepted the deal and asked us to wait a few minutes while they printed the paperwork and recontact the bank I was being financed through. About an hour later they presented me an offer. $692\/month on a 33k car\/72months. I was like you gotta be fricking kidding me! 33k\/72mos is around 460\/month before interest. My credit score places me in the 4-12% apr range, so at most my payment should've been $550-$575\/month. I demanded five times to see a printout of the terms the bank was offering me on the loan. NOTHING! I left that day and I said screw them. They added the money they discounted the car for, on the back end of my loan and didn't think that I was smart enough to figure it out.\n\nI wouldn't recommend that anyone purchase a car from Matt Bowers Nissan because It is a very shady car dealership with even shadier employees. Additionally, their customer service is terrible, and they are totally unprofessional. When they were Eric Hill Nissan, the service was so much better. My experience with them was extremely unpleasant one. They will smile and pretend to really want to sell reasonably priced cars to hardworking people but all they want to do is steal your money. Since they like to engage in unethical business practices, I'm reporting them to the BBB. My car shopping experience was horrible, and this dealership is responsible for that. If you are looking to buy a car from them, be careful because they are not conducting honest business. If there's a car that you like on their lot, and they do not want to sell it to you, they will give you the run around in an attempt to intimidate you into not purchasing it. Take your creditworthiness and business to dealership that actually values their prospective customers enough to treat them with dignity and respect.","stars":1.0}

Therefore, visiting here is a lot less painful than most malls...well, almost.\n\nThe traffic in and out of Green Hills is ALWAYS a pain, regardless of the hour. Additionally, parking can be a bit of a nightmare. Although, the Mall is presently adding another parking garage - which should assist to alleviate parking woes.\nThey also offer complimentary valet parking - which is a plus. \n\nWith a movie theater and a decent restaurant across the main lot, one could potentially make a day of their visit to this area - without ever having to move their vehicle.

I used to see the owner on premises at the old place but I guess he is not needed at the new place. Our blonde (only telling color of hair due to she never told us her name) never returned or gave any explanation why the food took so long. I used to be in the restaurant business and I noticed 3 other tables that say after us had their food!!! My best bet is that she never turned in the ticket! Fine then, explain that to me and I will understand. Not keeping your customers informed to problems will only make matters worse. Which it did! Our food finally came and all was fine except my wife's eggs (supposed to be over medium) which were undercooked. When I paid our bill $51 dollars, I told the lady at the cash register (when she asked how was everything?) that it was not great for waiting 35 min! She replied sorry and that was it. We used to go to the old location because of the great service and friendly staff. I am positive we won't be returning and with service and attitudes at the new location.

{"text":"Husband and I ordered takeout at lunch here and maybe that was our mistake as we should have tried the breakfast? In any case, we won't be ordering food here again. The only way I can describe it is bland. Like, shockingly and amazingly bland to the point I suspect the only reason people rate this place high is portion size. \n\nI ordered a burger and my husband ordered the French dip sandwich. Neither of us bothered to even eat half. I tried his thinking the au jus sauce would help and even that had no flavor and did not help the dry meat in his sandwich at all. So disappointing. \n\nThe onion rings were crispy so I'll toss them an extra star for that. \n\nIf you enjoying eating a giant plateful of tasteless warm garbage for the same price as good food, then check out The Crying Onion!","stars":2.0}

It comes standard with your choice of beans, rice, a protein (or veggies), pico de gallo, cabbage, avocado (not a spread, but actual slices of avocado), sour cream, a salsa, and your choice of mild, medium, or hot salsa for dipping. It's a HUGE burrito. Service was extremely friendly from the young staff, so they received a generous tip. I'll definitely be back. They also have a points system for rewards.

First, check-in is always nice and smooth while sometimes there is a line you are always greeted with a smile. I purchase vouchers through a customer appreciation program through my employer where I get 2 night stay for about $200, along with this I get a resort credit and arcade credit, win-win-win! I love that I am able to text request to their customer service and get a quick response. If I need a microwave, text it, if I need additional towels text it, if I need recommendations on a good place to dine,  text it! The rooms are nice, beds are comfortable, and entertainment overwhelming. It helps that it's so close to Grand Sierra where we can drive over and enjoy their entertainment as well.

Although it is winter and I did not get to sit outside their patio seating has decorative lights that hang above you while you eat and I think that is such a nice touch to the whole feel of the restaurant. The food is even better then the decor. I got the beginning burger and although it is just a classic everyday burger I have never had one as good as Bru Burgers.

They were supposed to coordinate care with a periodontist and did not follow up. Wound up with an emergency but took it elsewhere because a week or two prior my spouse had problems after leaving this office, too. Her teeth and gums are amazing. But after they convinced her to have some old work redone (embarrassed to say how much $$$ this cost) she went back for an adjustment as was predicted by the dentist. When she went in, the dentist said he did not understand why she was there. Then he proceeded to make the problem worse. She's never left the dentist with pain, but that's what she's got now due to the \"fix\".\n\nWe are both going to a different dentist. That so far, I'm very happy with.

Having gone through that process, I think it was the best decision we could have made for our furry guy. \n\nI read so many reviews of vets in our area before deciding on this one, and I'm glad I did.

So they had a high bar set for them here in Springfield in my mind.  \n\nThey pulled it off.  \n\nThe one thing that they have over Wayne is the Grilled Macaroni and Cheese sandwich.  Gang, they actually make homemade macaroni and cheese in a pan first.  Saw it with my own two eyes.  Then they put it on a sandwich with even more cheese and grill it.  \n\nYou want one.  Just go and get it.  \n\nI was happy to see that the Maryland Crab grilled cheese is on this menu too.  That's a favorite of mine.  \n\nNow that we have one down on this end of Delco, that's less time I have to spend on the Main Line.  Though I'm sure I'll visit the Wayne location just to say hi.  \n\nService is friendly here just like in Wayne.  They hire happy people here. \n\nAnd, they even built a mini 15 seat theater in the dining area for the kids to watch their cartoons nearby, with theater seats and tray tables.

I would suggest 4 plates (depending on your choices) per person if you want to fill up. The sushi was fresh, robatayaki was the star of the meal (octopus was delish, so tender!), brussel sprouts were v flavorful so be prepared for that. Wouldn't recommend the cod fried rice- v bland. Go for the drinks, all the cocktails were on point (I enjoyed the gin-base Re-Animator). \nAs for the service, our waiter was the least accommodating, asking us to put all our food orders in at the beginning of the meal, a little challenging with a small plate style restaurant. He got several orders wrong and proceeded to argue with us about what we said vs what he heard before bringing the correct dish out. We were celebrating a friend's birthday so we ordered dessert prior to the meal and our waiter offered to put a sparkler in it, which he forgot about until after the dessert was placed on the table... A little awkward! Overall a good spot for an intimate dinner\/drinks with one or 2 other people but not good for groups.

The service was fine, although the ordering and delivery take place at opposite ends of the long half wall that separates the work from dining areas.  There were plenty of free tables at 8:00 am and I was very comfortable occupying a booth by myself.  \n\nI had a basic breakfast of Quinoa Steel Cut Oatmeal, which came with sliced Strawberries, Walnut and Brown Sugar.  It was thick and tasty.  Glad it was a small bowl.  The Toasted Everything Bagel was fresh and held the Veggie Spread well.  With coffee, the meal was under $10.  No problem there.  \n\nI have visited enough Paneras around the country to know that while they all look the same, they do not all act the same.  The Doylestown facility did not seem to have any problem with attitude, nor accuracy, although other Yelpers seem to have had different experiences.  \n\nGiven the overall quality of the experience and the ease of parking, this Panera gets my vote for the optimal breakfast on a busy morning in the downtown area.","stars":4.0}

Sun King really got Indianapolis excited about craft beers, which caused numerous other, smaller companies to emerge in the market.  Many of those smaller companies have been able to produce some phenomenal brews.  One of those companies is Chilly Water.\n\nWhen I first heard the name, \"Chilly Water,\" I imagined it to be a brewery in Colorado or New Mexico, popular with folks who just completed a tough day of white water rafting.  Well, it isn't. Chilly Water is located in one of the city's prime nightlife areas.  I knew that if the place was doing well enough to occupy its current space, it must serve excellent beer and great food.  I also feared that it would be occupied by people even more pretentious than I am. I was wrong.  The vibe is very Grateful Dead-esque (which is A-OK with me!).  I was right about the former: Chilly Water serves excellent beer.  While I did not get the chance to sample any of the food with my mouth, the selections that I sampled with my eyes are ingrained in my memory.  \n\nAs a man who possesses a love for a great variety of beers, I decided that ordering a flight (plus a little extra) was appropriate. I started with the Chilly Lager, which was hoppier than expected.  I found this to be a pleasant surprise and think that it is a great selection for any season. I was most excited for Maggie's Farm House, as I truly love a Belgian Saison.  To me, this brew was especially smooth and very flavorful.  Don't go into it expecting a truly European experience.  For something made in Indianapolis, it more than suffices.  Captain Trips was next on my hit parade.  It was very hoppy with a nice citrus twist.  It was perfect for a summer's eve. The Five String ESB was a something to which I was really looking forward, but it turned out to be my least favorite - it should have been more bitter.  Oh well.  The One Hop Wonder was my favorite of the evening.  It was truly a \"wonder.\"  \n\nI was as impressed with my server as I was with the beer.  I have yet to experience such excellent service at a busy brewery.  She had a very good grasp on Chilly Water's current and upcoming selections.  The establishment also hosts some great live music, including New Augusta Bluegrass Band.  It was their performance that actually that lit the fire under my rear to finally visit this brewery.\n\nChilly Water is sure to become an Indianapolis gem.  If you plan on visiting a local brewery for an excellent in-house experience - or just to grab a growler, it should be at the top of your list!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Great pizza and a fantastic place for lunch.  The people here are really friendly and big soccer fans so props for that!  I probably stop by here at least once a week for lunch as I work in the area.  The decor is very simple, but is very clean and welcoming as opposed to some other pizza joints on South street.\n\nThe thin crust pizzas are heated up in the pizza oven and taste really good and fresh.  My favorite is the spinach, tomato, and ricotta pizza, which really hits the spot and makes my afternoon hum by. \n\nI've had delivery from here which I was a little disappointed by, but I think if you eat in or carry out, you'll be fine.  I think thin crust pizza just needs to be eaten fresh, or it's not quite the same.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"A zoo + roller coasters + drinks = a good time.\n\nMy friends and I got fun passes\/annual passes so we could come for their food and wine festival.  We usually first grab a beer, go ride Montu, grab hard liquor (like a pina colada or margarita) wait in line and finish our drinks before getting on Cheetah hunt, and then grab more drinks and walk around the park.  It is a fantastic plan that leads to good times.\n\nThere are two places in the park that serve liquor.  One is the building across from cheetah hunt.  The other is a tiki hut looking stand that I can never remember where it is, but we always stumble upon it.\n\nI love the food and wine festival, because I can try a ton of little plates and sample a lot of little drinks.  Their sangria is pretty good.\n\nMy favorite ride is Falcon's Fury, but I heard I'm crazy.  Other favorites are cheetah hunt and montu.

For old fashioned soda fans and ice cream creations, you can satisfy your crave here as well.

{"text":"I am not a touchy-feely-aura-voodoo-new age type person despite being from California or having Louisiana lineage.  However, this place had a bad vibe.  \n\n\nThe hostess was nice.

Another 10 minutes passed and our waiter charged the table chastising us for having sat ourselves.  I explained that the hostess had sat us.  At that point we should have left.  We still didn't have menus, nor did the table next to us who had been there before we arrived.\n\nThe band was fine.  The decor was nifty. The patio was lovely, even at night.\n\nOur server's attitude did not improve, nor did the frequency of his visits to any of the tables.  Parts of our order were missing or incorrect or far from tasty.  My pal had a Mojito assuming it would be fabulous given the name of the establishment.  In fact, that was the only thing that was NOT tasty.  The rest of the meal was tasty enough for her to return the next evening.

{"text":"So I have mixed feelings about this place. I've only been here twice but the first time was great. The second wasn't that great. First time was for lunch. Ordered the lunch specials for sushi. Got a hibachi shrimp too. Everything we ordered was great. Spicy yellowtail was awesome. And tuna avocado roll was great. Shrimp hibachi tasted good. Grill was clean and everything was cooked well. \n\nSecond time was for dinner. Take out. Placed the order. They were nice and accommodating when I wanted to add something to my order. But when I got home and saw my sushi which was the same as I ordered the first time, it was nothing like what I got before. It didn't even taste the same and there were bits of shrimp. No yellowtail was anywhere to be found. I was so disappointed. I live about 15 min away and wasn't about to go back. My BF ate what I didn't want and we dealt w it. I also got hibachi veggie noodles which is just lo mein basically. But the \"veggie\" part was just onions and slivers of carrots. And the vegetables they gave as a side weren't cooked all the way. It was nothing like the veggies we got w the shrimp hibachi on our first visit. \n\nI'll give this place another try and hopefully it's like the first time.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"A friend and I made our first-ever visit to the Gathering Place the other night.  It is very large with plenty of standing room and shuffleboard, pool, and video games.  They even have bands come in on occasion.  Even though it's a Vandal bar, one of the bartenders was respectful and even cracked a football joke when I walked in with my Boise State shirt.\n\nUnfortunately here is where the rating suffers dramatically.  That night we played a lot of shuffleboard and had a lot of fun doing so.  Our drinks were kept away from the table so as not to interfere with our play.  When my friend tried to knock my puck off the table, it smacked the far end of the table wall.  This happened right when an individual staggered out of the back office, which was located nearby.  Suddenly he yelled out \"NOT SO HARD!!!\" with an aggressive look on his face.  The place was somewhat packed and other people did not even notice any loud noises.\n\nI have played shuffleboard at many places with the same style of play without any objection from any staff member or owner.  So I went over to the person, who turned out to be drunk out of his mind, to ask what we did wrong.  When I tried to state my case, he cut me off and shouted back in a brusque tone, \"I don't care!  You better keep it down over there!\"  He then shuffled off before I could say another word.  This individual was later identified as the owner of the establishment.\n\nSo I went back and suggested that we finish our game and immediately leave the bar.  I personally won't be returning here, as there are much better and more professional ways to handle this situation, especially if you're the owner of the establishment representing the business.  Perhaps these people are forgetting the fact that there are other options in town.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"This review is based only on my last service experience. I dropped my car off on Friday, January 15th around 5:30pm for an inspection, emissions, and oil change (coupon included tire rotation) service by Saturday, January 16th at 10am. My husband was already there waiting for me in their waiting room. He overheard an unsettling conversation between a Nissan trainer and a Nissan trainee discussing leasing options for customers. The Nissan trainer explained to the trainee that he doesn't worry about customers holding or being able to afford the insurance needed to lease a vehicle, rather he just worries about the sale and lets the leasing department have the difficult conversation with the client about insurance details.\nNow for the actual service part: Within the time I dropped off my car and picked it up, I had received four total calls from Exton Nissan: One on the 15th at 7:31pm confirming that I will be bringing my car in on the 16th for service (my car was already on the lot), Second on the 16th at 9:12am from Gaspar to suggest an additional service that I may want to think about having them do, Third on the 16th at 9:34am from Gaspar asking if I had another insurance card with my car listed on the form rather than him just calling the number on the insurance card that I had, Fourth on the 16th at 10:25am letting me know that my car was finished even though I asked them to be done by 10am. When I picked my car up from Nissan I was not presented a multi-point inspection sheet and was told by Gaspar that he didn't have anything further to explain to me other than the fact that I owed them money. I paid the friendly blonde cashier, who was the most professional person I encountered there, and was asked by another man to rate them the highest rating on my survey.\nAfter bringing the car home I noticed that my tires had not been rotated. I called the service department on Thursday, January 21st and spoke with Jim. Jim proceeded to tell me the definition of a tire rotation which just completely baffled me because I wasn't asking what a tire rotation was, rather I was asking why they didn't do a tire rotation to my car while it was there for service. I explained to Jim that I am reluctant to even bring my car back to their service department and would give them a call if I changed my mind. After hanging up with Jim I shortly received a call from the Service Manager, Bob, who repeatedly apologized and offered to make it right. I have been coming to Exton Nissan for service since 2010 and the quality of customer service continues to diminish. I will probably give them one more shot and decide from there.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Like others, if I could give zero or negative stars I would. It all started when I needed to move some of my things to storage several years ago while moving to a smaller apartment. They had quoted a low rate for moving my stuff there, but about a month after moving my things there, I received calls and bills from them demanding more money for the move - nearly doubling the cost we had already paid. I went to ask them about it in person and to check on everything I had there, and they seemed extremely angry that I did so. The woman at the desk was INCREDIBLY rude and kept saying she \"lost\" the key to my storage unit so that I couldn't see it, and the manager was screaming and yelling at us for no reason saying that the amount they had originally quoted us wasn't correct and that we owed more. When we said we wanted proof that he had ever mentioned that before the move, or where that was mentioned in the contract, he threatened to call the police and never give me my things back (I'm assuming that was his only defense, as he had no proof and was simply angry someone confronted him). \n\nI had started to assume they had already sold my things and were looking for an excuse to never give them back. I figured that I would suck it up and pay the difference even though by this point I knew it was basically a scam, but I refused to leave until they gave me the key and let me see my things. I honestly didn't know what else to do with the owner screaming in my face for being there. It took them over 30 minutes of bumbling around and acting like it was lost before they realized I wasn't leaving and magically found it in five seconds. My things were there, although jammed carelessly into a tiny wooden cubicle, and I realized I needed to get my things out of that hellhole as soon as I could. \n\nAbout a year later I found a larger apartment and was extremely anxious to deal with the people at Superior again. This is where the story gets even worse. Because they had a shady way previously with moving my things, my family and I hired a different moving company to transport my things from my storage unit to my new apartment in the city. Of course, that horrible owner was there again and was LIVID that we weren't paying his movers and found our own. He was looking for any excuse not to let them in - saying that they were illegal immigrants, an illegal moving company, and that they needed to show him all of their documentation before they set foot in the door ... or he said he would call the police (again). \n\nMy movers DID come back with all of their paperwork, even though the owner was shouting and angry at them simply for being there. But no, that wasn't good enough. While my family and I went to look at my storage unit, apparently he went out to the movers in their truck and deliberately threatened them and insulted them for being immigrants, telling them he knew they were illegal and that he was going to call the police and other insults I can't even imagine. Suddenly, our movers came to us saying that they were literally threatened multiple times and didn't feel safe being there, and they were leaving! This left us there with NO ONE to move my stuff out of there, and all of the extremely rude, discriminatory, and overall hostile work staff at this establishment. Some of the storage employees there were literally in shock at the behavior of the management, and so were we, as we hadn't done or said anything rude to them to deserve it.\n\nThis left us there, on my moving day, with no mover and no way to get my things out. The owner said that we could either pay their movers to move my stuff or we were SOL and on our own. There was NO WAY we were paying those jerks another cent for poor service and basic indecency as human beings, so we were faced with the only option of loading up one small van-full of stuff in my moms car and taking one trip at a time to my apartment to slowly get everything there - something that would have taken like 6 trips and all day. When we got back from the first trip, however, we immediately noticed a new problem. Yes, it gets EVEN WORSE. Apparently, there was a huge leak in the roof of my storage cubicle, so half of my furniture had water damage and black mold inside of it. I looked around and the vast majority of the units had water just pouring inside like a shower faucet because it was raining that day.. some of them were flooded, and some didn't even have any semblance of a roof! \n\nSo even after all of this, many of my things were ruined. When we finally told them that we had enough and  wanted our money back for all of the storage fees because half of my items were clearly damaged beyond repair, they suddenly got timid and offered to move the rest of my things to the city for free in compensation. Of course this wasn't fair, but by now, I just wanted my things out. I was able to repair some of my things, but I'm mostly glad to be done with them after all the crap they put me through.

The decor was somewhat rustic with the beautiful natural wood tables which had the tree bark running along the edges. The water glasses were mason jars. The special boards could be seen easily on decorative chalk boards near the entrance. The restaurant is quite small so you'll have to make reservations. \n\nNow to the food.

{"text":"Very disappointing experience. I took a 50th anniversary edition very low-mileage car in to have a rattle in the dash fixed. The mechanic drove it 40 miles!!!! (I took photos of the odometer when I dropped it off and picked it up) and used a 1\/4 tank of gas to 'find the issue'. Plus, there were small chunks of mud left on the cars paint and soft top.The rattle started at 70-75mph. I took the car out on I-84 the weekend before and drove it so I could hear the problem. I didn't use 1\/4 tank of gas or need to drive it 40 miles to hear the rattle. When I called the Service Manager, Ted, I was very upset about this. He listened and did his obligatory 'sorry that happened' speech. I pushed back and it felt to me that he got defensive and said they had their 'best mechanic' on the job and give him leeway to 'do what he needs to do' to resolve an issue. He told me how unhappy would I be if the car came back not fixed. That felt rather patronizing. I told him they didn't need to needlessly drive it 40 miles to find and fix the issue considering they could get it up to 70-75mph as close as the I-84 and Gowen Road exit. It seemed he had every excuse in the book. After going round and round, he said he'd bring it up in the staff meeting the next day. Not sure if this happened. Very disappointing experience with the service manager and the lack of oversight on mechanic. I understood one of representatives to tell me that the mechanic logged driving it 20 miles.\n\nLisa, Service Advisor, and both courtesy drivers were very nice and very helpful. The car's issues were fixed, and they did replace the 1\/4 tank of gas. However, the little joyride was unnecessary and irresponsible on their part.","stars":1.0}

Some exhibits could use a little sprucing up but in general they've done a great job. They've got everything from the brain to the heart to interactive exhibits.

No problem getting a reservation on Friday night - not necessarily a good thing. The waiter was attentive, which should be expected when the place is practically empty. We ordered crab and shrimp cakes and steak tartare for appetizers. They were both good but we've had better interpretations of both around town. My wife had chicken marsala with house made pasta and side salad. The chicken and pasta were nice. The salad was a little wilted. My hanger steak came out the first time overcooked at medium well when I ordered it medium rare. I reluctantly told the server and she happily took it back. A few minutes later, the second attempt came out and it was rare bordering on raw. I ate it and it tasted fine with the sauce, but when you pay over $20 for a steak you expect it to be cooked as you ordered, especially in a less than crowded restaurant where the cooks have adequate time to focus. With the proven options in east Nashville, I doubt we'll give this place another chance. I wanted it to succeed but it doesn't seem likely when nothing in the menu stands out and steaks can't be properly cooked to temp.","stars":3.0}

Then we transferred from one apartment to another here (including transferring a deposit), and they insisted we owed a huge amount of money just to transfer. It took about 2 months of emails back and forth to get everything straightened out to finally transfer apartments. Note that the apartment neighbor in the first apartment we lived at here, above us, was so loud that we were often actually woken by her stomping and banging around. The office has poor communication and our emails were often ignored. The building is poorly constructed, smells like sewage in the hallways and common areas, and maintenance is incompetent at best. It takes them forever to come and there are many things they were never able to fix, such as all of our network jacks that never worked. They completely ignored our move in form with things we wanted to have looked at. We were told it would cost $5,000 to get out of our lease early. This isn't documented anywhere in the lease. After we moved out, we got a very large and confusing bill with what we owed. I don't recommend living here.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Yikes. Being nearby a favorite of ours, In Riva, my girlfriend and I thought we'd give it a try. We're always interested in Mexican joints. While we knew it was rated sub 3 stars, we went in open minded.\n\nHowever, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences you can have after a long day. We decided to enjoy the weather and sit outside. That was our first mistake - the outside patio does not present a great ambience as the loud, exhaust-laden cars and trucks fly by. It also appeared as though our waitress forgot about us from time to time.\n\nTo start, we were offered a list of specials for happy hour and ordered from the list. However, we were then told later on that what we ordered wasn't available. We then decided to go with the classic chips and salsa to start. Let me tell you, I've never seen such a dinky, little handful of chips - and no, of course they weren't made in-house or warmed up just for us, that would be too much. We finished those quickly and asked for more which came with a $1 extra charge - that is kind of odd. Isn't chips and salsa a staple of a Mexican restaurant? Isn't it like the bread and olive oil you get at an Italian restaurant? Usually they just replenish at will, am I right?\n\nThe food was decent. I won't even delve into that because all that stands out was we were told \"your food will be right out\" and then proceeded to wait 30 minutes. We even considered just getting up and leaving because the meal became a waste of time. \n\nI hope this review is more valuable than my experience at Johnny Manana's.

As I was walking down the aisle to get to the register I immediately noticed the cook in the back (a woman) who had on a cheetah turban with the rest of her strawberry red hair hanging out with NO hair net on neither did she have on gloves. She was also chewing gum and having a phone conversation. So anyway, I'm up at the counter trying to look over the menu and find a sandwich that interest me when I notice that the cashier is also on the phone, with her boyfriend, arguing back and forth with him. After a couple minutes of scanning the menu she finally asked me if I was ready to order and when I said no she rolled her eyes and returned to her intense argument with her boyfriend (who apparently was cheating on her). Soon after this she asked me again and I said no again. I wasn't ready to order because I couldn't concentrate on what I was reading on the menu due to her bickering. I ended up walking out and sitting in my car confused. The only thing I could think about was who trained these employees. The fact that they were so unprofessional and  clearly unaware of it was shameful. I honestly couldn't believe it and just thought I'd brief you guys on what to expect when dining or at least trying to dine here.

I could have sworn the menu said three tacos, and that there was cheese on the tacos, but maybe I'm wrong. honestly, I could go to Baja Fresh or even Chipotle and get more tacos for the same price. Glancing over the menu, everything seemed to be on the more expensive side. \n\nThe service was poor. It was busy there, and I understand that, but I was at the bar and still had to wait at least 10 minutes until I got a refill on my sangria (which by the way, had one cherry and a bunch of crushed limes and lemons and seeds....it was supposed to be berry). There were 4 people behind the bar, which seemed like more then enough for how busy it was, and twice, I watched as a bartender looks at my glass and kept it moving. They also aren't very friendly, and are kinda rude, my friend and I were talking, and the bartender just yelled at her \"Want another yard?\" She didn't hear, so I tapped her arm, and before I could even say anything, he yelled it at her again. \n\nI will only be going back for happy hour, because that is the only time the price is reasonable for the food.

I flagged the waitress down and asked about my latte, she replied that others were in line and I had to wait for those, which was ridiculous because I had already waited about 20 minutes. She also made it sound like she was doing me a favor by saying she wouldn't charge me for the extra coffee that was being remade. Then we told her about the hair in the French toast. \n\nThe manager finally came over and was unapologetic. He seemed like he was a new manager and didn't know how to give correct customer service. We told him we didn't know if we'd come back and he seemed not to care. \n\nHe delivered my latte and explained he didn't know why there was a hair in the latte. (The baristas were men that had long hair and were not wearing hair nets and they were not pulled back). The French Toast was remade, but rushed out and it was undercooked. \n\nWhen we finally got the bill and we were disappointed that he charged me for my Avocado Toast and the girl that had the hair baked into her French had to pay for her $3 iced tea. Half and Half should have waived both our bills because of the unsanitary measures that we experienced. An even better manager should have taken care of our whole table to ensure we would come back despite what we experienced.\n\nWith everything health related going on, overall very disappointed in the management and this establishment for not taking it more seriously and having more customer service.","stars":1.0}

So us 5 had to climb 4 flights of steps with luggage and my youngest who has special needs with heart and lung problems, only to go in the room that's suppose to be a non-smoking room that smells like smoke and red tape around the smoke detector so it won't go off when you smoke in there from the previous people.

{"text":"I came here with my friends on a Sunday for dinner and I was very pleased with the food and service. The waitress was very attentive. The food came out in a timely manner and tasted delicious. I order the Chicken Pad Thai in Thai Hot. It was very flavorful without being overly hot. My friend ordered the Thai green salad with the peanut sauce...and OMG this is by far the most delicious peanut sauce Ive ever tasted in my entire life. I wish I could order a gallon of it and just eat it with every meal. lol I also highly recommend the Tom Yum Hed soup. It was very cooling when I ate it with the Chicken Pad Thai. \n\nThe Thai tea looks delicious but I didn't have a chance to try it.

And the best part, when you order the ice cream you get two scoops( try the coconut lycee)!  Everything tastes good here. Service is nice and quick as well.

The brisket was out of this world, we also tried the pulled pork platter and sandwich. Each platter comes with two good sized portions of side dishes with cornbread. We tried the Mac n cheese, collard greens and coleslaw all which were very good. The backed beans weren't bad but a little too sweet for my taste. They have take out beer which is always a plus too! There are some tables inside as well as a small bar and they have a cute little set up outside with lights, umbrellas & tables as well which is nice. It is right on 420 just before the tracks, if you don't know it's there you might miss it! The people are real nice and my take out was ready in 15 mins.

{"text":"So what would make me travel 30 plus minutes into Trenton besides spending time with my family? Of course fried chicken! This is a small, expanding Central American chain. It has been over a decade since I last visited Central America but I was able to reminisce (a little) on this visit. \n\nNow on to the food. I really wish the American version included the kick of spice that is included in the original Central American recipe. I also see they make it a point to advertise they use hormone-free chicken which I appreciate. However, there is barely any white meat to this citrus fried chicken, just crunchy skin. The sides are okay I would get the french fries and yucca fries and skip the others. I appreciated the labels describing the Horchata, Jicama, and Tamarindo juices in english. Even for someone like me, who is familiar with them, it was useful in my decision-making. Get the tamarindo lightly tart and sweet to wash it all down.\n\nWhile the service was a bit snappy(i don't expect much from a fast food joint) on my second visit,  they were able to quickly fullfill our large order. \n\nThe area is a bit sketchy and I was a little nervous waiting in the rear parking lot while my family arrived. But atleast they have a parking lot and I didn't have to search for street parking, which may have been impossible. Follow the large arrow to the left of the store front to find the parking lot.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I waffled between a 3- or 4-star but I settled on 3. First I'll say that the wait staff was very friendly and helpful. But the food was nothing really special. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with it, just nothing I haven't had elsewhere. \n\nLet's start with the alligator gumbo. It was a bit too spicy for me and lacked salt. The alligator meat was like tough chicken. But it was ok. \n\nI had the oyster po boy. It was a good sandwich, but it's hard not to compare it with B's Po Boy in Fountain Square. The oysters are tasty in both places but much bigger here. Still B's bun is far superior than the standard hoagie bun used here. Also the tomato on the sandwich at GR's seemed out of season and cut too thick. I removed it. Overall, I'd give B's the win on the sandwich. \n\nAll in all, it's a decent restaurant with a nice staff and a great ambience. But I had to skip dessert as all selections were too pricey.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Harvest last night just for fun on a random Tuesday.  We chose the restaurant because the reviews are great and we really are into the restaurant's mission.  Farm to table issues are our \"thing\".\n\nFirst off, the restaurant was extremely empty, which can be a good and bad thing.  I know it's a Tuesday in a down economy, but still...\n\nThe service was great, but perhaps too great.  Our waitress hovered over us. She was perfectly nice about it, though, and I got the sense that she was trying to provide quality attention - just not our style I guess.  \n\nThe menu is limited and seasonal.  We expected that given the farm to table mission.  I would also note  that this is not the most vegetarian friendly place.  There was only one pasta dish that would appeal to a veggie.  We chose to split gnocchi as an appetizer and chicken for dinner.  Both were good.  I'd give them a 7 or 8 on a 10 point scale. The gnocchi was fairly unique and we really enjoyed that dish.  The chicken was supposed to be Southern style as it came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw, corn bread, and BBQ sauce.  It was perfectly good, but coming from Nashville I would say it could have been better.  Overall, a solid food experience, albeit not off the charts.  \n\nMy 3 star rating versus the 4 star I considered is due to the ambiance.  The inside was nicely decorated, but boring.  The noise level was eerily quiet.  There just didn't seem to be much going on.  Even if we had gone on a Friday or Saturday I don't think it would have improved much...\n\nWe would go back if a friend really wanted to try Harvest out, but I don't think it would be our choice again.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"This is not a Verizon store and embarrassingly enough, I thought I was in one the whole time I was there... in fact, the sales associate even told me he worked for Verizon when I asked him how long he'd \"worked for Verizon\". \n\nThis my friends is a bizarre 3rd party scam retailer + up charging business. when you walk in, the products are strangely nailed down where you can't even test them. They kept me in the store for an hour+ and then charged me a \"Set Up and Go Plus\" fee of $20 just for me to sit there and basically set up my own phone while they worked with other customers and chatted with me about my life story. Y'all, I could have set up my own phone in my own office for free! The sales associate also told me about some weird machine they have called \"the Redux\" or something that squeezed water out of your phone, I didn't know that him choosing to talk to me about this machine meant that I would be charged $30 for an exclusive stupid \"Redux Single Line Membership\"! Lucky me! they charged me $30 to *maybe* squeeze my phone like a lemon one day. \n\nso if we're doing math, that's an extra $50 bucks for literally absolutely nothing besides me being gullible and walking into the front door of a store with a giant Verzion logo and expecting it to be an an actual freaking Verizon store. \n\nSo in conclusion, I would highly recommend you buy your phone at an actual Verizon store or online because this place is just ridiculous and I'm super embarrassed that I didn't read the fine print and get the hell out of there. lesson learned.\n\nMy sales associate Cordero was a nice & friendly guy and I wish him well in his writing but I feel like I was not communicated with honestly and was scammed and that really bums me out.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"It's not hard to find a good meal and a nice glass of wine in Center City. It's not easy to find those things together for less than $20, though, so I'm glad Zavino stepped in to fill the gap between fancy BYOs and divey bars. \n\nThe place is small and well-appointed, with rustic wood and exposed brick, a long bar and a big cool-looking metal wine rack behind it. Prepare to be elbow-to-elbow with your servers and fellow diners, and pray hard that no one spills anything. The close quarters give this place a convivial vibe, and you'll have plenty of opportunity to ogle other people's food before you order.\n\nAll of the small vegetable starter dishes are tempting, and I recommend the roasted beets: a few firm, flavorful bites each of red and yellow beets, with pistachios, olive oil and creme fraiche, I think - whatever it is, it's delicious. Pizza is thin and tasty, with a chewy, slightly charred crust and simple, well-chosen toppings. The size is perfect for one really hungry person, one not-so-hungry person who wants to take a couple slices home, or two people to share.\n\nThe wine list, with about a dozen choices each of red and white, is relatively diverse and inexpensive. The beer list is a snooze - stick to the grape stuff here. \n\nOne last thing about the humble, omnipresent glass of water: Zavino's is just the right temperature and tastes really good.","stars":4.0}

The meat melted in my mouth and flaked perfectly. I'm a huge salmon lover, and it was by far one of the best I have ever had.\nWe got the cheesecake for dessert, which had hints of coffee and other ingredients that I didn't quite catch. I'm also a cheesecake fanatic, having had some of the best cheesecakes in NYC, but this was unique and delicious in its own way. It was a perfect way to polish off a beautifully cooked and presented meal.\n\nI would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for the best in dining.

{"text":"Two words. Ruby Tuesday.\n\nI should've known when my fiance and I ventured out on a Friday night, and we got seated right away that we should've bolted for the door.  I am confused? is it Asian? why are the servers wearing jeans and tacky sneakers you see on chestnut st? and am I in an 80's dive bar with this music?\n\nJeez.  so we sat down, and our rough around the edges jersey boy waiter came over to us.  He suggested we order 6 plates for the two of us. For two people? really? so we ordered 3, much to our servers dismay and some cocktails.  We ordered the rock shrimp tacos, the spicy walnut apple salad, and the Thai chicken wings. The food was fair at best.  Was not tasting the Asian influence AT ALL.  Besides some brightly colored Asian tree wall decor I could've sworn my significant other had taken me to some cheap, fake chicken chain restaurant. \n I was so confused by the concept of this restaurant that I asked the waiter . His response, \" Its just fun\". Fun? so is it Asian? \" ya its like Asian fun\". So i decided to try to give this \"Asian fun\" restaurant a shot at their dessert.

{"text":"Having grown up in Nashville, Cheesecake Factory is synonymous with excess in my head. Excessively large portions, excessively large prices, excessively lavish decor, excessively large stomachs needed. The food is nothing mind-blowing: just your standard American fare generally done well for a lot of money. Every time I eat here, I bring enough food back for a second and maybe even third meal. \n\nYou've probably seen the crowds milling about the mall exit and wondered why they were all waiting for lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food. I, too have that question, but hey, it's damn good lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food, and over time has become a bit of an experience unto itself. If you're here, you're probably either celebrating something or rather wealthy. Be prepared to wait, although I've never waited for more than half an hour. \n\nAnything that comes with their mashed potatoes is a safe bet, as they're everything mashed should be--large, creamy, delicious, will land heavily in your stomach and fill you up. The fried mac and cheese appetizer is delicious. Fish tacos are my favorite order, I've had good experiences with their chicken chipotle pasta, and any one of their sandwiches is a safe choice--good and economical, as they're on the cheaper end of the massive, massive menu, and they come with a lot of fries. \n\nOrder what you want to eat, be prepared to take food home, and save room for the cheesecake--it's worth it.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Although I have always been a fan of Mr. Ed's, I have never taken the time to put my thoughts down on \"paper\".  Mr. Ed's screams New Orleans, especially the menu;  and I'd say it's an \"old school\" type of restaurant.  The exterior facade is old school and there is a small parking lot in front that was full when we arrived at 6 PM.  There are two dining rooms.  The first is when you enter the restaurant and is next to the bar.  This room is a little too busy for me and I prefer the rear dining room as there is a little less foot traffic and it's a little quieter.  However, quiet is not how I'd describe this place.\n\nOn Friday 21 SEP 2018, our party of nine arrived at 6 PM to celebrate my grandmother's 88th birthday.  As Mr. Ed's does NOT take reservations, we opted to come early as this local favorite usually gets crowded quickly.  Luckily for us, there was one large table left and we were able to be seated immediately.  Had we arrived 30 minutes later, we would have been S.O.L., as the restaurant quickly filled to capacity. \n\nThe clientele is a mature crowd, and my wife and I marveled at how at 51 and 48 years old, we were (with the exception of my son) the youngest patrons.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  LOL.  In fact, out of the blue and without any prompting,, my six year old proclaims (a little too loudly) \"Look at all these grandmas in here\"!  \n\nBut enough about decor, clientele and facades.  Let's talk food.\n\nAppetizers:\nFried eggplant sticks: These were delicious and highly recommended.  Not frozen, these freshly made spears were served piping hot with a side of marinara and were covered in fresh cheese.  \n\nOnion rings:  These hand battered onion rings could never be mistaken for a frozen variety.  The breading is light and perfectly seasoned for all palates.\n\nEntrees:\nKid's fried shrimp dinner: What a pleasant surprise to see that Mr. Ed's uses the same large shrimp that appear on the regular menu, and not some \"shrimpy\" sized variety.  Pardon my pun.\n\nPan-fried catfish with lump crab-meat:  Thankfully my wife has a small appetite, and not only was allowed to sample this dish, I got to enjoy her leftovers the next day for lunch.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the amount of lump crab-meat on top was quite impressive.  \n\nLump crab-meat Au gratin:  I love an au gratin, and this one was chock full of crab-meat.  My only wish is that my dish had been served a few minutes sooner, as it appeared to have sat a few minutes to allow our entrees to arrive at the same time.  The cheese had started to cool and the dish, although more than warm, should have been served hot.  However, the flavor was great and the quantity was sufficient for large appetites. \n\nStuffed crab dinner: My dad and my grandmother both ordered this dish.  In my opinion, the crabs were a little overcooked, as the crust was well past a golden brown and bordering very dark brown.  It appears that they may have been deep fried for a minute or so prior to serving, but I am not positive.\n\nStuffed soft-shell crab:  This was the best dish of the night, and I am a little sorry that I did not order it (my sister did).  The presentation was gorgeous and my sister raved about it.  However, I was not afforded an opportunity to sample it.  It will definitely be what I order next time. \n\nDesserts:\nFlan:  I don't think I've ever had a bad flan, and this one definitely fit into the same category.  This variety was slightly less \"custardy\" than most, but delicious nevertheless.\n\nBread pudding:  If you don't like whiskey\/rum sauce, don't get this bread pudding.  I loved it and had to restrain myself from drinking the sauce like a shot when I was done.\n\nI highly recommend you order an appetite if you visit here, as the restaurant gets very crowded and good freshly prepared food takes a little while to arrive. Our server Marcia was rock solid as always and we were fortunate to have her as our server.  What a fabulous little restaurant.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Updating my review for spring\/summer. This is my favorite Starbucks location. They are the most friendly and most accurate of all the Starbucks I have visited throughout the Reno Sparks area. The store is always clean inside and out. The Baristas greet you with cheerfulness and almost a song in their voice when they take your order. It's so refreshing to interact with someone who obviously likes their job and is helpful in meeting customer service needs.\n\n\n\nUpdating my rating. Totally disgusted that it's not even mid October and Starbucks has sold out for the rest of the season of their pumpkin scones. One of the BEST sellers they have and they're not making anymore for the year! A major marketing miscalculation on your part Starbucks.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The food here is great but I feel like their menu is really Americanized.  My boyfriend's parents love this place so we have been here a few times with them.  Everytime we go I am disappointed all over again at how pasta-centric the menu is. The last time we went I got lucky with a great lamb special but I feel Italian food is so much more than just big dishes of pasta.  To be fair they do offer a side of pasta or vegetable if your order from their carne section but that consists of all your various Parmesan options.  In summary this place is great for what it is but I have been to far better Italian restaurants that show the full range of Italian cuisine.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"After two hours at Mingle, I walked out with a pretty mediocre gel manicure and pedicure. The nail technician actually hurt me somewhat, hacking away at my cuticles and tearing them off (OW). Definitely not worth it for the price. I had wanted a design on my nails, but I gave up on that when it took them two hours just to do a basic paint job.\n\nBut THEN, a few days later, the nail beds of a few of my nails (both on fingers and toes) were red, swollen, and hurt to touch. A crummy polish job is one thing, but INFECTIONS??? Ick. Six days after my appointment, I had to remove the gel manicure so that I could apply the medicine my doc gave me. \n\nI am completely disgusted by this place. After infecting three of my nails, I will never, ever, ever be returning. Totally overpriced for a bad and painful mani-pedi, AND they must not clean their tools properly.

I've come for lunch the chicken nuggets were obviously sitting there for a while because they were not fresh, or hot. They were luke warm and dried out. I've come back again today to order nuggets and asked for a side of Big Mac sauce, now I've worked at McDonald's so I know how it works. Just because she couldn't find a button( because there isn't one but you can special request it) she told me they can't do that. Sat in line for 5 minutes and she's like we can't do that. I told her to get a manger. Took another 5 minutes and still no one to help me! And I'm in the drive through I'm so fed up with this location they need to be properly trained on how to handle a situation rather then get \"ghetto\" and have an attitude just wow. I ended up driving off and went to White Castle because nobody still botherd to help me. I'm on my lunch break I don't have 10 mins just to sit in line because you can't talk into the head set for them to add a side of Mac sauce. Just stupid!","stars":1.0}

The website to pay or request service is very convenient.  The pool is great and the grounds are very well kept up! It has been mostly quiet with the exception of a great big loud as hell pool party an inconsiderate resident had on a Sunday. The hot tub needs totally revamped. There is a computer area but it is not really accessible as if the management needs to leave they have to ask you to leave too. Coffee bar, well it's a kuerig in the office, but hey it's free coffee. Roger is extremely professional and does a good job. If you receive a package you need to go to the office and wait and wait for management to get it for you.

Luke made sure to walk us around the car from front to back and showed us all the safety features and inner workings. You can tell he really knows these vehicles from top to bottom and it was good to finally deal with someone who took the time to really explain everything. Luke and Chris were able to offer us a very fair number on a 2017 Ford Explorer Sport and a good trade in value on my Ford Focus.

{"text":"Moreno's is right across the street from where I work, and it takes a lot of willpower to not go every lunch hour. Located in a plaza near King's and 60, it is very accessible and has back roads to give you enough options depending on the traffic at the time that you visit. I take this into consideration as Brandon traffic gets bad in the afternoons. There is a lot of parking space, however, they have to share it with several other businesses and the last time I went, there were no available parking spaces at all and people were parking across the street. \n\nI have been there many times, and have yet to have any negative interaction with anyone there. They really try to accommodate everyone trying to order, and they do have a number system although they don't always use it (especially when there is not a lot of people). I see that they are also doing stuff in the background while making sure that the customers get their orders, but are attentive enough that they ask me what I need even before I decide how many\/ what type of pastries I want. \n\nThere are the options to get hot food, Cuban sandwiches, pastries and desserts, coffee, or all of them. Hot food is good, although a bit pricey and not too flavorful, and the portions are a bit small in relation to the price you pay. The pastries are just wonderful! My sister drops by Moreno's every time she passes through Tampa on the way home to Parrish because her family loves the guava and cheese pastries as well as the quesitos. I drop by every once in a while to order those pastries to bring to them, and always end up eating one. My boyfriend loves their cookies and apple fritter, but says that the latter has a LOT of sugar. What would you expect though, right? (P.S. Apple fritter tastes really good). Cafe con leche is on point, I love the strength and flavor of the coffee.\n\nI wouldn't really recommend their hot food,  but the sandwiches, pastries, desserts, and coffee are all good reasons to go.","stars":4.0}

And, you have to love the random soda cooler with voss water and orange-carrot juice.\n\nIt's not the dusty candy that makes this place great, it's the awesome prices, cool associates, and the fact that you can find practically anything you need.

Had to get a water bottle that will someday have nothing stronger than water in it, $3!!! \n\nThis store has men's, women's, children's, and home items including luggage. It doesn't bother me that the clothing items are from older seasons. Even if I could afford Michael K off the runway I wouldn't because I need that money for food and more food. \n\nThis is the most random and possibly shopper satisfying store within the downtown mile. The few things they could improve on are the selection for plus size cuz big girls need love too, and the floors are a little dusty\/isles cramped. Also, customer service is minimal at best possibly nonexistent unless you search for someone albeit happy to help, you are on your own.\n\nWith some more spacing, organization, and trendier selection in misses this place would be competition for a lot of the shops near by. \n\nI don't know of any store down here where you can find an iPhone case, car charger, escada perfume, and Italian gummy bears - on the same shelf!\n\nAt times it's like a treasure hunt through all the stands and racks, other times it's like shangri-la with every divine item at your fingertips!!","stars":4.0}

I was immediately told that I needed to make an appointment but they were able to fit me in. I only waited about 15 minutes before getting my nails soaked. I sat another 15 minutes with my nails soaking. The mani was efficient in the fact that it was done well and lasted awhile. However, I would not go here to relax. My manicure was rushed and I felt like I was more of a burden than a paying customer. Overall, my nails looked good but I'll try to find somewhere else.","stars":3.0}

They have nice dinner platters, but it just doesn't make up for the lack of flavor in the food.

They seem under staffed and under trained. This is Magazine Street, it's a new place, I understand that there will be growing pains but where's the owner? Tonight (8pm Sunday) my party of 3 and our dog stopped by to have a bite and a couple of drinks. We went inside and grabbed menus from the bar. The sole server\/bartender said he'd be right with us. We wait outside at a table for 15 minuets. No one came. We saw a single employee\/bartender\/server running around, working hard. He saw us. We saw him. We left.

On the plus side, we sat at the bar and had excellent service.  Here's the thing.  If you are a bar in Indiana and put a breaded tenderloin on your menu, it really ought to be good.  This was the worst I have ever had. I thought maybe it was overcooked, but I'm really not sure how it was so chewy.  The nachos were scantily clad with few toppings.  They were not as bad as the tenderloin, but they were very bad.  If you decide to go, just get a flight of beer.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I honestly do not know what to tell you. After months of waiting for the right time to try this place out and the expectancy of a great grass fed burger I'm left speechless. From the moment  me and my two children stepped foot in the restaurant I could sense this place was starting to disappoint. There were no host or hostess at the podium, there was a awful band playing extremely loud music in the far left hand corner and to top it off the dining area was poorly illuminated. This place reeked of disaster. I approached the bar and asked, \"can we be seated\" and we were guided to a table that had the light flickering on and off intermittently. So as we sat there for nearly 12 minutes I prepped the kids and stated that in three more minutes we are leaving if we do not get our drinks. At long last, on the fourteenth minute we had a waiter. They must have had two waiters for about 30 people. I couldn't believe it. Our burger experience just kept growing worse. We received our appetizer promptly after all it was just queso and chips. Our main grub now that's another story. The only upside is this, they did make good on the 50% off appetizer that is offered through Yelp and because of the extra long wait for our burgers they did give us a free appetizer. But that's where it ends because I have never in my life tasted a burger without texture and mushy before in my life. Ugh just thinking about it now just... I don't know if they can be called burgers or not it reminds me more of a patty made from soggy bread totally disgusting. Oh, and by the way if you show your Yelp coupon be prepared to be  stalked, followed and repeatedly asked ,\"how is everything?\" All in a vain attempt to win you over. All I wanted was a good, no great burger!","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I know that Pi is a popular place, and that it gets packed in the loop, especially on Friday and Saturday nights.  Since they don't take reservations for 2 people, and being the smart yelper that I am, I called first to check on the wait.  They said that by the time I came in, there would be no wait, especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start.  So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later, and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman).  I walked in, and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait.  Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min.  Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in.  And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area.  I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone, so he never got the message.   He walked in, took one look, and I knew we were both on the same page.  I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name, and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around.  They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time, until I left, which  is bad business, whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is), or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is.  Either way girls, it's rude.\n\nDon't get me wrong...the pizza here is good.  But it's no mystic pizza.  And it isn't the only pizza place around.  This story has a happy ending though.  We went to Dewey's, were promptly seated, experienced the best service there, as we always do, and left with full bellies, probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi. \n\nNever again.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Jacques-Imo's exemplifies the New Orleans dining experience.  Funky, loud, off-beat, rowdy, sassy, saucy, unique, and DELICIOUS.  The atmosphere here cannot be duplicated anywhere else, as evidenced by the failure of Jacque's foray into the Big Apple.  \n\nLocated a few blocks off Carrolton on Oak St., in what appears to be a converted house, the restaurant cranks out some of the best food you can find in the city.  The walls are chock full of artwork by Dr. Bob, a local artist from the Bywater.  It's always busy and they don't take reservations for parties fewer than 5, so be prepared for a 1-2 hour wait.  Don't worry, just tell them you'll be down the street at the Maple Leaf (great dive bar with foot stompin, hands clappin brass bands) and they'll come find you.\n\nYou'll be served complimentary cornbread, which is moist and twice as finger lickin' as anything the Colonel's got.  Then you'll get a salad with spinach and fried oysters.  The dressing changes from time to time but 9 times out of 10 I like what they've done.  For appetizers you HAVE to try the alligator cheesecake.  Don't eat here and not try it, because you'll regret the decision later.  It isn't a dessert.  It is more like a cheesier quiche with lightly spiced sausage.  You'll want a whole serving to yourself.\n\nFor entrees you really can't go wrong with any of the seafood offerings.  Personally, any time I can get my hands on their version of softshell crab I do so.  It's piled high and called *godzilla*.  How could you not try a dish named godzilla?\n\nWhile you're eating the owner and chef, Jacques, may walk into the dining area and start riling up the crowd.  Just go with it and start yelling and screaming with him.  For those of you who are tourists, if he's yelling \"who dat\" just yell \"who dat\" right back at him.  \n\nIf you're staying in the quarter Jacques Imo's is definitely worth the cab\/streetcar ride uptown.  Go here.  If you've got a few more days for other meals you might try Crabby Jack's for lunch, which is just across the parish line down Jefferson Hwy (AKA Claiborne in Orleans parish).  It's run by the same guy and has some of the best poboys in the city, IMO.","stars":5.0}

I recently bought a brand new F150 from this place.not even a year with this truck and I've spent more time in there service dept than I have ever spend with any other used vehicle I've purchased. than is a trickle down effect from the service manager on down. They are  thought to blame you no matter what. not even if you can show them a video showing them the issues , they continue to deny them and send you back to the \"POS\" they sold you. $1000 a month I spend on this truck I could've purchase a luxury car and be guaranteed a loaner of the same quality.when I bring the car for service and they have to keep it over night they ALWAYS  give me a  KIA \n SOL you can even fit a shovel in that car.but the funny part is they ask you what do you need the truck for when you buy it and they know I used my truck for business. you would think they would at least give you something similar being that is their product that has issues.but they expect you to be fully functional when they hold your truck over night and give you a kia sol for you to work out of.\nplease, please, please  theres 4 other ford dealerships in Tampa please take your business  to one of them and hope that you  dont have to deal with bad people like this. they know once you sign that note your their slave for the time of that contract and their only purpose is to extort money out of any way possible.\n\n\nPLEASE READ IT MAY HELP MAKE YOUR  DECISION. to my earlier post (Andres Bernal) I got a call no more  than an hour later from Brian the service manager, the same person thats refuse to help me before. laugh in my face and still has not send me any proof regarding the so called submittals he did on my behalf. so basically he's ultimatum was that if I didn't remove my post from google stating the facts and what has actually happen to me, after purchasing this vehicle from their dealership, brand new, 0 miles. That if I didn't remove my post immediately they weren't only not gonna work to fix the issue there is. but that I wasn't  gonna be able to used them anymore. Not only was that a threat it shows to the extend their willing to go, to cover up and shut the people that are letting the consumer know the facts, and how truthful it is that once they have you under contract, it really doesn't matter what you think your rights   are as a consumer or the loyalty factor for servicing your car in the same place where you trusted your money was worth something and you were gonna be treated as a person and just another number to hit your quota. sometimes your avoid mom pops places because your afraid of the scams or being bamboozle but this place is no different and probably worse because they hide behind  their big building. but  at least those other places you already know that deal is to good to be true. but even tho this place might look like a million bucks don't let it fool you its just a mirage, to make you think their legit  but in all reality they run grimy, pressure tactics to make  you budge and do their way. \nif anybody feels that they can help me bring people like this to the front and show off their true colors please help! I'm not afraid to speak and let the truth be known a phone call and a threat is only gonna make me want to put this out and make sure that if I can send save somebody from dealing  with a situation like this after spending over 25k with  a company and  hold  a note for another 40k and be treated like this ? I'm sorry not treated bullied into their way or the highway. let me be the sacrificial lamb and please learn from my mistake and take your business to another place. As for that guy Brian service manager Karma tends to play us the same hand we've dealt.

{"text":"Wow. What a big disappointment! \nI'm always excited to try newly found places and give them a go. Groupon offered an opportunity to visit so we took the offer and headed out.\n\nI was really surprised as we pulled up. Visually, it made me wonder if we were at the right place. Eclectic comes to mind, but I can't even say it really encompassed that in a good way. It had the impression of a flea market upon first glimpse from the outside. When you approach the front door, the first thing you see is a hand written sign about GROUPONS!  And it made me feel like that must be the main focus of their endeavors, folks with Groupons.\n\nWe were there on a Sunday afternoon around 5. We were seated shortly after arriving. The waitress was friendly and accommodating, brought water and took drink orders and returned with them quickly. I had a glass of the Ruffino Chianti, $7. Moderately priced, and fair for what a glass of wine costs most places.\n\nThe bread they bring to the table - AMAZING. It really is great bread. Perfectly golden, and a crunchy outside, with a great soft textured bread inside. Very warm, borderline hot! Awesome. Surprised there was no olive oil for dipping, and instead--foil wrapped pats of butter.\n\nI ordered the FETTUCCINE GORGONZOLA. It comes with a salad too. My salad was drowning in the Balsamic Vinegar dressing. Seriously, there was a pool of it on my plate that I also, dipped my bread in after I stopped eating the drenched iceberg lettuce.  One small grape tomato on the whole salad. After a few bites I stopped eating this very forgettable salad.\n\nThe main dish ($16):\nA perfect portion of al denta fettuccine pasta, in a very creamy gorgonzola sauce. Piping hot! The disappointment was that was all there was in it. I tasted no garlic whatsoever, there was no cracked black pepper in it either. It became really, a glorified plate of mac and cheese in a way.  I realize some recipe's simply call for a basic cream sauce, sans the pepper, garlic and other possible tasteful additions, but this one was very bland regardless.\n\nMy friend ordered the Seafood Penne ($18). It was also a good portion size, not too much, not too little. The penne was cooked al dente as you would expect. The flavor of the dish was actually pretty good. It had four or five salad shrimp tossed in, as well as what I thought were half dozen bay scallops--however, they were actually bits of white fish, not bay scallops. The downside ... was that the sauce was a soup consistency! It was SO runny! My friend literally used a pasta spoon for some of the meal to get the sauce with the penne into his mouth. (I know, right?) It was the only way to do it. He also used the bread to sop up the flavorful, yet very runny \"caper sauce\". \n\nThe women's restroom, was creepy. It felt dirty, though the floor was seemingly clean and there was nothing really to indicate it was dirty, the bathroom \"felt\" dirty. \n\nThe rest of the staff (kitchen staff and possibly a dish person) roamed and out of the kitchen area - looking as if they hated life. No smiles, no friendly hello's as you pass them. The only friendly one in the place was our server, the only server on duty.\n\nThere were other patrons there. I counted 4 other tables seated indoors while we were there. One table seated outside. I noted pizza's leaving the kitchen more than plated dishes. (we were seated right next to the kitchen against the middle wall separating the staircase and the kitchen access. Not a complaint at all, just simply where our table was.\n\nOur groupon was for $30 and our bill came to $45 + gratuity. So, walking out we spent roughly $25 in addition to our groupon. Was it worth it in our opinion? Absolutely not for the money - groupon or not.  \n\nFor the quality of the food served, the ambiance and service ... it should have been a $20+ gratuity experience (including the wine). We would have left feeling we got what we paid for and chalked it up to an average and non-memorable experience.\n\nAmici's is located in the Lockerbie area. That's about all it has to tout. It is a historic building that originally was a residence back in the 1860's and then became a deli and grocer.  \n\nWhen you pull up the menu for Amici's it immediately states \"5 Star Italian Restaurant\". I gravely disagree. Though the price points represent a 4 Star .... the food barely meets a 2 Star.\n\nIf you are going to Amici's hoping for a positively memorable food experience, you will be very disappointed. Mama Carollas http:\/\/www.mamacarollas.com\/ or the Milano Inn http:\/\/www.milanoinn.com\/  will leave you feeling MUCH more like you've experienced authentic Italian or sicilian cuisine for the price ($55 dinner for two).","stars":2.0}

I booked an appointment for the same afternoon and was seen shortly after I checked in.\nThe atmosphere is nice, you can tell the facility is very clean and well kept: it only takes a few seconds to make a great first impression and they nailed it.\nI saw Amy Jo- I cannot wait to go see her again. I told her how long it has been and all of my problems with my brows. She did a five minute consultation and explained to me exactly what she was going to do. She was very professional, had a great personality and took her time (which a lot of estheticians do NOT do). I left with perfect brows- I definitely will be back again.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"My company had our Christmas party here tonight (for about 30 people, I think), and I have to say, they really impressed us. \n\nFirst, we were supposed to be having the party at McLeod Tavern. Several days beforehand, one of our staff checked on the reservation and discovered that MT had CLOSED with no notice. Ever try booking a company Christmas party at the last minute? NOT EASY! \n\nFortunately, she found this place, and got us in. We have quite a few folks at the company who are into eating healthy, so she specified that, and they totally pulled off a great menu for us! \n\nWe had 2 salads, one kale and the other the Wife's Favorite. A chicken dish and pot roast with horseradish, 2 types of Brussels sprouts- one with bacon and the other crispy Buffalo style, roasted vegetables (including carrots, broccolini, and cauliflower), roasted baby potatoes and mashed sweet potatoes. All these were served family style. For dessert, there were multiple types of cheesecake (the pumpkin w\/gingersnap crust was fabulous!). Also, champagne sorbet with fresh berries. \n\nEverything was hot and delicious, and the servers (including managers) were attentive and friendly. \n\nThey did an amazing job with very little notice, and pulled off a great evening for us all. Hubs and I are considering coming back for brunch! \n\nMy only complaint was the seating. I had to switch seats with someone because I was originally given a seat at a long table with backless stools. One of the other options was a tall table (which are also not comfortable for me). As a person with degenerative disc disease, I was thankful to get a booth seat with a little switching around. For the owners-- trendy is good, but old people and people with disabilities cannot sit in this type of seating for long. I wasn't sure what I was going to do if I hadn't been able to get a booth seat.","stars":4.0}

The menu I ordered off didn't mention that the roll already comes with it so I ordered a side of it. I couldn't eat any of it after one bite. It had a funky taste. I would happily eat the sushi anytime though! One thing to note here...they used to have a location inside of Lulu's pizza on Bogus Basin road. We took my MIL there tonight for her birthday, thinking it was still Superb Sushi. Well, it's not and we were really disappointed. Lulu's apparently bought out that location and runs it as their own now. They are no where near as good as Superb.","stars":4.0}

I ordered chicken nuggets with their home made honey BBQ sauce and a coffee crunch shake. Everything seems to be made to order and very fresh. At first taste I felt the chicken was a bit bland and under seasoned but very fresh and juicy. Once I tried it with the sauce it was great. The sauce gives the chicken all the flavor it needs. The shake was very thick and delicious.  Taste like real ice cream was used not the stuff in the bag. Overall I enjoyed my meal. I'll go healthy next time and try one of their salads!!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"My server, Hannah, was a gem. I was very indecisive about what to order and she was very patient and willing to help. When my family told her we were here from St.Louis and this was our first visit to Cleveland-Heath, she offered a special, complimentary \"welcome\" appetizer of Deviled Eggs. How sweet!  \n\nAs far are food goes, here's what we had:\n\n-Deviled Eggs: These are not your standard deviled eggs! The filling is very pungent, so much so that I had to scrap off about half the filling so that it wasn't overwhelming. I wouldn't say I loved them or hated them, but nonetheless I think these eggs are worth a try, especially if you're a big fan of deviled eggs. \n\n-Gringo Tacos w\/Shrimp: I loved the portion and presentation of this dish! The purple cabbage on top of the tacos added great color. The shrimp was fresh and there was just the right amount of topping to shrimp ratio. I suggest adding a squeeze of lime and a light drizzle of the sauce on the side. The fries on the side were also great (Sweet Potato Fries ftw!)\n\n-Pulled Pork Sandwich: The absolute star of the meal. This was my entree and I feel I 100% made the right decision. The Pork was so flavorful and the bread is amazing. I'm no Pulled Pork aficionado or anything, but this was the best I've ever had. I gave my father a bite and he said \"I thought my tacos were good, until I tried that Pulled Pork.\" I agree with this statement. \n\nI got the kale salad as my side, And I'd say that's the only part of the whole meal I disliked. It just didn't taste like much. However, there's a large possibility that that's because it was next to my decadent sandwich. \n\n-Tomato Soup (Soup Of The day): A HUGE Bowl. If you like tomato soup this one is solid. \n\n-Beignets: Heaven. I love Beignets and these did not disappoint. When dipped in cream...there are no words. \n\nAlthough the drive from St.Louis to Cleveland-Heath means I probably won't be back any time soon, I really appreciate the service and food I got whilst here! A definite must if in the area.","stars":5.0}

And who wants to get under a car in the HOT desert?  What's not to like?  COST.  A 5-star rating gets kicked down to 2, because of very high cost.  A trip to Jiffy Lube had cost approx $28.  With the advent of synthetics (I'm a believer) the oil is much more expensive... but not that expensive.  Now a trip to JL cost $85 and that with a $10 discount!  In addition to heightened cost of the Platinum 0W-20 at $40 and a filter for $10, I am charged a $40 ($39.99) \"Signature Service\" charge.  So, where is the customer value proposition for about 3x the cost for only twice the distance?  In another words, the synthetic route at JL will cost you much more than the extra miles you might gain.  The Signature Service charge at $40 is simply too high.  I'll will buy the same Penn oil for $25 at Walmart and a filter for $6 and pay $10 for a hoist charge at a local auto hobby shop (TOTAL $41) - until - Jiffy Lube gets smarter about the Signature Service charge.","stars":2.0}

Unsurprisingly, that also means that this place can get ridiculously crowded on Sundays as well. We were told that we would have to wait 1hr30min+ to seat my party of 4.\n\nThankfully, we were able to snag a few seats right away at the bar right away, saving us the wait. The bartender was friendly and the game was on TV. \n\nThe bartender recommended me Hot Chicken Fried Chicken from the Nashville Hot Chicken menu. Absolutely mouth-watering. The Hot Chicken Fried Chicken comes on a bed of mash potatoes and gravy with collard greens. Every time your mouth got too hot from the chicken you can dip it in gravy to cool yourself off. Amazing food, truly.\n\nThe drink I had was an extra spicy Bloody Mary. I did not know that this place specializes in extra spicy Bloody Marys or else I would've reconsidered.

Their bread is outstanding and so are all the pickles. I just wish they would sell the loafs for takeout. \n\nBut what about beer you say? \n\nBeer is very good on consistent basis and I like the fact that Jean is very quality oriented. In some \"other\" nearby places brewers cover up their lack of expertise by making high alcohol beers almost exclusively, but not here. I cannot think of any beer Jean brewed that has been overpowered by alcohol. Take note peeps, some of us know when you do that! Jean is an expert at making full-flavored low ABV masterpieces. No need to cover any flaws here because there aren't any. \n\nIf there is anything negative to say about Tired Hands  it has to do with the music\/noise.

While service was decent and the restaurant layout is fun, the food itself was subpar. I ordered a Dallas burger and my niece had a brunch burger. We also had fries and onion rings. Let's start with the goods. The sauces offered at the table was pretty delicious. There's chipotle ketchup, jalape\u00f1o sauce, and burger sauce along with your standard ketchup and mustard. The burger patty itself is very juicy and cooked perfectly. The rest, is bad. There was not enough distinctively flavors to define the burgers. My Dallas burger came with coleslaw and BBQ sauce and Monterey Jack cheese. When I bite into it, all I could taste was cheese and pickles. There was nothing BBQ or Dallas about it. The brunch burger faired a bit better with the sunny side up egg and smoked bacon. It's good but again, not spectacular. The burgers here are on par with Red Robin's maybe but definitely not anything more than that. Also, the burgers are tiny, it caught me off guard how small the portions are for the price. The fries and onion rings are the worst. The fries are extremely soggy. Imagine buying fries and then walking in the rain, that's how the textures were. The onion ring was not much better. The deep fried flour was falling apart and I'm eating onions and broken fried dough separately. Also, the onions inside was almost burned while the outside is under cooked, tell me how that's possible? Overall, the burgers are Ok and everything else is bad.

My vitals were taken by the receptionist and I was then seen by a nurse practitioner.  She said my lungs were clear and recommended that I take antihistamines.  When I said I was concerned about the blood in my mucus and that I also had chest discomfort she gave me a prescription for a chest x-ray.  She said she couldn't do it there because their machine was not working.  I went for the chest x-ray the next morning the the imaging center she recommended.  It has been a week and I have not been able to get through to anyone at the facility or the radiology center they referred me to.  I was able to get through to their Clearwater office, but they could not give me any information on my diagnosis and promised me a call back that I have still not received.  In the meantime, I went to the ER and found out that I have pneumonia.  Glad I did because otherwise I would be walking around with pneumonia and treating it with antihistamines.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I do not normally take the time to provide feedback regarding my shopping experience, but my encounter with the Automotive Service Center Manager warranted an outreach. This Saturday, April 21st, my wife dropped off our new car for regularly scheduled oil change and tire rotation. Sears representatives were courteous and timely in performing the service and we received a call that our car was ready within an hour. However, we were notified by voicemail that we would possibly need a wheel alignment and a new air cabin filter. I was initially curious as to why our car with 14,000 miles needed a wheel alignment so early, and decided to accompany my wife to pick up the car to ask a few questions. Upon entering the automotive department, I was not greeted by anyone, even though three associates were all visible at their computers. After about 45 seconds, I walked up to the associate and advised him I was there to pick up the car and had a few questions. Upon inquiring why our newer car needed a wheel alignment already, I was greeted by a very sarcastic and confrontational Automotive Service Center Manager. I advised him that I understood this is regular maintenance, but that I've never needed this service this soon after purchasing a car. He thought it best to continue to patronize me and preceded to tell me a condescending story about how cars can go out of alignment once they leave the dealers lot. After berating me, he left his station to go the garage. At this point, another associate took over and we completed our transaction. Over the past 15 years, I have taken all our family cars to Sears Automotive. My entire family, including my parents and siblings, all take their cars to Sears. For this reason, I felt it was necessary to reach out and express my disappointment.","stars":1.0}

No potato bread rolls here, the bread is straight from a NJ Italian bakery, Aversa's.

Regardless, something I feel I should mention.\n\nThe individual who drove me to my destination had passable driving skills, but had me questioning whether it would've been smarter to walk at one point. After we arrived, I asked if I could pay by Visa: No! The machine isn't working. Perhaps when 2 out of your 3 methods of receiving payment are no longer working, you should let me know beforehand so I can tell you to get lost so I can find another way home!\n\nNo matter, I think...I'll do him a favour and get some money out of the ATM in the convenience store. After arguing to leave my bag in the vehicle as collateral, I finally concede and rush over to get money out as fast as possible. It's very busy and late, and tons of drunks are trying to find cabs right now. When I return, there's two other people getting out of the cab, and one of them is attempting to steal the bag that I thought was being watched by this quack of a cabbie. I got my bag back from the thief and had to listen to the cab driver tell me he actually was watching my stuff and wouldn't let someone steal anything, despite an individual making it about 8 feet away from his car with my bag.\n\nThe long story short here is that I received the opposite of \"Above and Beyond\".

Was really breaded, but had a nice crunch to it that overrided the greasiness. Would benefit by being fried at a higher heat.  \n\nThe eel, avo and cucumber roll was great.

{"text":"I have been dying to try Mr. Dunderbak's, so when I was up in the area I had to stop by. The restaurant is located in a strip mall next to a gas station, it doesn't look like anything fancy but it's SO good. The minute you step inside you feel like you've walked into a pub in Germany. They have a market with a deli-counter, sit-down dining, and your choice of 2 bars to cozy up at. If I had one criticism it would have to be the fact that the tables are super close together, we actually had to move our table just so we could sit down.\n\nI was pretty intimidated by the beer list (it's huge) so I went with the Grapefruit Hefeweizen, maybe next time I'll be more adventurous. For our appetizer we started with the German Pretzel, it was delicious and the beer cheese dipping sauce was fantastic. For entrees we went with the Sour Cream Schnitzel and the Oktoberfest Sausage Platter with a Polish Kielbasa and Wienerwurst. The Schintzel was massive and absolutely delicious, the sausages were very good as well, though I preferred the Polish Kielbasa over the Wienerwurst. For our sides we got the Cold Potato Salad, Cubed Potatoes, and the Potato & Cheese Pierogis. I was a little disappointed with the Pierogi, but that's probably because it was German vs. Polish which is what I'm used to.\n\nHonestly, this is probably the only authentic German restaurant in Tampa, so if you're looking for delicious German food you'll need to make the trip! I'm looking forward to trying some different things on my next visit.","stars":4.0}

It can't be called a chain because each one has its own theme and corner of the world it pretends to hail from, but in every way that matters, they're identical.\n\nIn the last several years, Mass Ave has all but lost the unique blend of personalities that made it such an attractive part of town to begin with. It's no longer 45 degrees from anything. It's just as parallel and universally ordinary as anywhere else.\n\nI give it a 3\/5 because it's the definition of ordinary. If I could give it a 2.5\/5, I would.\n\nSo, for Tavern at the Points, go pay a little too much for exactly what you expect.

It was slightly salty with rich butter... absolutely delicious! We also sampled two dozen oysters which were fresh and also delicious. We had a vegetarian with us and brought this up at the beginning of the meal for recommendations. So when we ordered the table side farmers salad for the group to share, we didn't realize it was prepared with pepperoni until we had been served. Luckily she was able to pick out the pepperoni and still ate it even though it wasn't her preference, but this was $15 per person and we didn't get comped for the miss even though we made our server aware. For entrees we ordered the  lobster, prime rib, 12 oz Smoke-Roasted Beet Steak, and Pappardelle. We also had the potatoes and mushroom Marsala as sides. The roasted beet had a great presentation table side which was a really nice touch for the vegetarian. I enjoyed the lobster, but should have ordered the lamb instead which was my first choice.

To compare to Grand China (takeout Chinese) they had a similar vibe such as seating and the menu. You order at the counter. They do have pictures behind the cashier showing which foods are most popular to help making the decision. I liked that they had multiple categories such as fried rice, curries and other entries. I choose the chicken Panang with coconut milk. And oh my word! This is one of the best Panangs I've ever tasted! You get a lot for portion size with a side of rice. It bursted with flavor! For the food alone, I would return for takeout. \nWhy they got a three is because of the cleanliness of the facility. The tables and floor were decent.

{"text":"Two years later and I'm finally getting around to writing this. Rincon Beach did the catering for our wedding in 2009. It was an offsite event, and there is not a bad thing I can say about them. Marc (the owner) came out to our ranch (the venue) and we sat down and discussed everything. He put my dad's mind at ease about the financial part of the wedding. We worked with Melissa through out the entire planning process and she was such a delight. I felt like she was one of my friends by the end of the process. \n\nWe decided to add the ceremony planning package (I'm an event planner so I didn't want to be doing ANY planning during my own wedding). This was by far the best decision we made. Unfortunately Melissa couldn't be at our wedding. Which was OK, she kindly handed over her assistant Jaime. Jaime was just as great as Marc and Mel. I felt like I didn't think about anything about my husband the day of. I would look at Jaime and she would just tell me what to do. In a very kind and not pushy way. She was perfect. \n\nThat's my review on their service...now let me get to the food!\n\nPeople are STILL raving about the food. We had a steak, fish and veggie option. All of which I heard were amazing. Of course I didn't eat much, but I had the steak and it was perfect! One of my vegetarian friends said it was the veggie option she had ever had at a wedding. \n\nMy favorite part was the appetizers. Since we were taking photos during the cocktail and appetizer portion of the event. The caterings staff brought the head tables large plates of appetizers so we could try them. I have never seen this at an event, and I thought it was brilliant. This goes back to their wonderful service!  My friends still rave about the chicken won tons. \n\nAll in all...Rincon is the BEST. Thank you for making our wedding perfect! I honestly don't have a single complaint....and I'm pretty picky.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"i have taken my wife to bailey's a few times, and we have always had a really nice time. we have always gone on a weeknight between 9-11pm, and it had never been very crowded. there is a bar up front, and a room with tables in the back. it is a very small intimate space, and the perfect place to take a date for a late night dessert. we have tried the bailey's chocolate brownie, the tumble cake, the banana bread split, and the chocolate inebriation. all have been delicous, with the tumble cake and the banana bread being big enough to split. they have a great drink list, with lots of dessert martinis that my wife loves. their selection of beer and spirits is also awesome, and the prices are very reasonable, with the real surprise being the lagavulin 16 for only $8 a dram. for a scotch that sells for close to $100 a bottle, that is a deal. overall, bailey's is becoing one of our favorite late night spots, and i see many return visits in our future.\n\n***check out my blog in my profile for a more in depth review with pictures***","stars":4.0}

{"text":"So we tried this place in the KOA in South Tucson. We didn't know it was even there until we saw it recommended on here. The meat plates had decent portions. We got a chicken and brisket plates. The chicken was a bit under seasoned and they don't really put a lot of BBQ on the meat so if you want more than just smoked meat, ask for some. Unlike a previous review I saw, they did not charge extra for it. The sides potato salad was ok but it was apparent was fresh and made in house which is a plus. The beans were good but I didn't try the coleslaw. The plates come with 3 sides which can be interchanged or doubled. Anything fried like tots or fries costs extra which is kinda lame because you're already paying $13 for the entree. We got an app of loaded tots which was tasty and a pork kids meal which was probably enough for an adult who eats smaller portions but only comes with tots. Overall the meat was really good. The sides were decent. The service was good but the price was off putting. We will be back but aren't dying to go back. It is a great alternative to the normal restaurants in this area.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"The hype and reviews are warranted. Everything was delicious and some things exceeded my expectations. I'm a sucker for great service, and it is impeccable here.\n\nThe cocktails are tasty and I'll definitely be wanting to try more on future visits.\n\nOur server, Dillion, was just a treat. Never felt rushed and he was super helpful and informative.\nHe suggested cheese curds, grilled shrimp, or blue crab gratin for appetizers. We went for the cheese curds and blue crab gratin. Now, I can admit that I'm not the biggest fan of cheese stuffed anything, let alone fried cheese. Don't hate it, don't go out of my way to get things like that. Girlfriend wanted to try them though. These cheese curds. It seems like such a simplistic thing, but they were so good. Not greasy like your typical fried food and just perfect in the seasoning with a great little aioli for dipping. I've seen and heard about the blue crab gratin and that delivered. I scraped every last bite I could get in the dish it was served in.\n\nFor entrees, my girlfriend got the mahi and I got the beef cheeks. Both incredible. Seasoning and flavors were spot on. The beef cheeks came apart with just the scrape of a fork. So tender. Like pot roast. It came on a bed of seeded rice with some peas and greens. The rice and peas reminded me of that fake fried rice you get at Chinese buffets, but in the best way possible. Everything just worked together. I was so full towards the end of my dish, but I could not stop eating.\n\nAt first, we weren't going to do dessert as we were both stuffed. But, Dillion tempted us with the menus and he reeled us in. So we ordered one to share. We wanted something simple so we went for \"The Cookie.\" They're baked fresh to order so we got a few minutes to let our stomachs settle. It was the simple sweet we needed to top off our meal.\n\nFor places that receive rave reviews all around, I try to keep my expectations tame. Well, they knocked it out of the park. Not a single complaint about any aspect of the meal.\nI'm so happy to finally have tried O+O and I will definitely be back.","stars":5.0}

The bread, which they obviously put a lot of stock in, is excellent - soft and airy on the inside, but grilled to give it a nice outer crunch.

She also tried to insist that I should take Phytoestrogen for my hot flashes even when I told her that was medically contraindicated by my family history of breast cancer. That a massage therapist thinks she is qualified to prescribe hormonal treatments is shocking, and that she think she knows more than qualified medical practitioners is even more so. \n  In short: I have never been so disrespected and insulted in a massage or spa setting in my life.\n   I will say, when I called the manager to complain, she was really nice about it. So I might be willing to go there again. Maybe. But I sure felt shitty when I left and I didn't even get a massage .","stars":1.0}

I opted for the gift card because I really like 4 Rivers and wanted to give this location another try and have the ability to have a different experience. \n\nYesterday I went with my husband for dinner. It was much less busy than the previous visit when I had lunch there. The same guy who worked there cutting the meat was there. He asked what we wanted and when I told him \"the pulled pork sandwich and a pulled chicken platter\" he asked me to repeat it. He seemed distracted. This time he did not say anything belittling while I was ordering. The other girl was pleasant and asked what sides we wanted with our platter. She informed us the cornbread was included which gave us additional options. We decided to get the corn, collard greens, and baked beans. The platter had the chicken slopped on the metal tray which looked unappetizing. I felt like it needed a bowl. Other than that, the food was really good, the baked beans were the best. The restaurant was very clean as well. While eating we could hear the guy cutting the meat at the counter yelling which was odd since there was only 3 other people in the restaurant.\n\nI did have a better experience this time and the food is honestly what keeps me coming back.

They have agreements and such with other airlines but yet then have no empathy when people are moved last minute to a flight they have waited hours for another,  have schlepped across the airport, no longer have seats they worked hard to get etc. The terminal US Air employees, were little help when we had single seats all over the plane. We asked multiple employees too. Most acted like you were bothering them but they were on duty. The only one that would look at it ended up putting kids in exit rows only to have to have us go back to have them moved again as they were in a nonallowed row and still sitting alone. Then after multiple attempts someone understood and fixed it so kids were in another row together and not alone. The gates were older and no outlets to be had. The employees don't seem to care and just talked amongst themselves and other than the boarding pass taker were not very friendly to anyone really.  On the flight the attendants we're not much nicer.  One older woman head flight attendant chastised people for using the front bathroom when carts blocked the bathroom for hundreds.

{"text":"This is an overall review of U-Pack and my full experience but I have information included about how dealing with the facility in Sparks specifically went as well :) \n\nFirst: I WOULD use them again, because of the price. I only paid $860 to move my stuff from Oregon to Reno. There was only one issue that came up, but I'll get to it. \n\nAlso worth noting that when I was requesting my trailer, I was under the assumption they provided the loading\/unloading help because it's an option on their site and when selected, the price is added, however these are just estimates and you will have to schedule this yourself. I was going through it pretty quick, so that's probably why I was confused, but important to keep in mind.\n\nThey dropped a trailer off at my home in Oregon within 3 days of requesting one, a Wednesday. I was able to get help with loading from Moving Staffers (the company they recommend) the day after that (Thursday), then on Friday a driver from U-Pack picked the trailer up. So that all moved pretty fast.\n\nI received no updates after this. I was checking daily on my moving dashboard on their site to see if\/when I'd get an updated arrival estimate but my tracking never moved from \"Picked Up\". I had a lot going on so I didn't bother calling until the day of my estimated arrival (I really should have done so sooner) and that's when I learned someone input my information in wrong (or something) and that was what prevented me from receiving any updates. My shipment had actually already made it to their facility in Sparks by this time and I didn't even get a call. I didn't ask how long it's been there because I almost didn't want to know because I didn't want to get frustrated about it.\n\nIf you find yourself in a similar situation (not receiving ANY updates), call them sooner than I did!!\n\nUnfortunately the apartment I have been moving into has absolutely no room for a trailer to sit overnight so instead I had to find some local movers to go to the Sparks facility with me to unload my U-Pack trailer, load their trailer, then take to my apartment. I had originally paid for Door-To-Door delivery but U-Pack refunded me when I told them I had to do it this way instead :)\n\n12\/6\/19: My experience at the Sparks facility was pleasant. I had to go into the office to sign some papers and when I was doing that they got my trailer out to be ready for when my movers arrived. Everyone was friendly and on top of everything.\n\nAlso worth noting I only ended up using 4 feet in the trailer, so they also refunded me for the length I had originally paid for and didn't use. On their site they say their minimum is 5ft, but I actually paid for 6ft, so I think that's their new minimum. Still, not going to make a big deal about that when I already saved so much money by using them. I was getting other quotes from $3500 and up for the same move. \n\nIf you can load and unload your trailer yourself, you'll save even more. I honestly spent more on help loading and unloading then I did on U-Pack so I recommend it if you have the ability and willingness to do so. But, overall, I still saved more than I would have if I went with another moving company.\n\nI also have to mention that every time I DID call U-Pack with questions, I've always talked to the nicest employees. Even if there was a mess up with my paperwork at some point, everyone was super helpful and friendly. I would use this service again and recommend to my friends and family if they are trying to save money while moving.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Philly's Chinatown. Overall similar to Nan Zhou Noodle House, and I've been to both places several times. It's usually easy to get a seat here even for dinner. I almost always get the House Special soup noodles with shave noodles, which they make by basically getting a big hunk of noddle dough and slicing off thick noodle pieces with a sharp knife into boiling soup. It's pretty much the best thing ever if you like chewier noodles with more texture. I loved these style of noodles in Taiwan and was ecstatic to find out there was a similar place closer to home. The hand-drawn noodles are quite good as well, as are the appetizers. Take out is quick too, maybe 10-15 min between placing order and having warm, soupy goodness ready to take home!","stars":5.0}

We went on an off night and it was packed.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Calamai Dorati (fried calamari). It was fresh tasting and piping hot with a good marinara sauce for dipping.\n\nFor our entr\u00e9es, we both ordered the Spaghetti Al Nero di Seppia e Granzeola e Vogole (Venezia).  This dish is also known as Black Spaghetti.  If you love seafood, you HAVE to get it!  The squid ink pasta is a wonderful addition to the dish that enhances the flavor of the crab meat and clams.  On the night we were there, the portion sizes were huge with lots of crab meat and clams.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu and the Neapolitan Ice Cream.  The tiramisu was light and fluffy with a great flavor.  The ice cream was delicious.  These desserts are big enough to share.\n\nThe service was impeccable.  They have a great wine selection.

{"text":"Stopped by here on a weekend after seeing this on yelp and let's say I had an eye opening experience \n\nStarted on with an appetizer. Great gyoza with a sweet and sour taste sauce, slight vinegar with the saltiness coming from the dumpling itself.  \n\nLet the food speak for itself and it did, amazing, comparable to any of the top ramen places I've ate at. \n\nI'm mostly impressed by the Iekei broth, intensely deep, with a strong fragrance of that garlic and black sesame. Noodles were al dente, just how I like them, good sized portions. The egg was cooked to perfection, yolk inside wasn't runny, but very creamy yolk that won't drip and ruin the broth, great medium. I went on a tangent about an egg, but it was amazing, trust me. Now back to the broth, very rich, as advertised on the menu, it was chicken and pork broth, and I'd never had this mix before. After trying it, I think the umami from this combination is a force to be reckoned with! \n\nAnd to cool things off, get a nice cold calpico, it's a carbonated drink that's a little sweet and curbs any sweet cravings. \n\nI'll definitely be back!","stars":5.0}

Manager\/owner? came over and checked in to see if we needed anything and to tell us about restaurant.    Friendly.\nFood:  Not the usual interpretations of pub food.  We had salmon salad, BBQ chicken sandwich and black bean burger.  All agreed the food was great.  Salad full of interesting additions and not cheap on amount.  Served as requested.  The chicken sandwich was probably the best I have had.  Thick properly cooked moist chicken breast clearly not from frozen.  Good BBQ sauce on a pretzel bun.  Ffries properly cooked and not over seasoned.  Husband loved his bean burger and had very fresh steamed veggies as a side.  \nPrice:  Good price point for well prepared good quality food.  Not what I would call expensive.\n\nWe plan on taking Mom here since she needs a new Greenwood restaurant for her group.  They have good soups and salad which is probably what she would order.

Could not get anyone to answer the line in the department. Sent her an email. Little did we know that she was not scheduled to work for the next 4 days. I have tried calling for two days and was never able to get anyone to answer. We had a deadline so we just went in and picked them up ourselves. Loaded 2 flatbed carts by ourselves while an associate in cabinets watched us. Only when we were done did she ask if we needed help. They did not have all the items we needed. Checked out. They failed to give us the 20% discount. Had to go back the next day for a refund. \n\nFinally heard from the original \"designer\" and she had absolutely no idea who we were and what she had helped us with even though I put her file name in the subject line if my email. This is Wednesday. Four days later. \n\nWent in to get the 2 cabinets that they didn't have at the first store. Had to load on our own because the 3 associates were too busy to even say hello.

{"text":"This hotel really rides the line of being ok and not actually being ok. The beds seem clean, are comfortable, and the staff are really, really nice. The location is fine - close enough to but also far enough from all the Latin Quarter drama. I'm here for a conference so I really only need a clean bed and a hot shower, and this room delivers. However, the room has some serious issues you really don't expect would be even on the radar for a hotel at this price point. For example: \nThe toilet paper is less than 1 ply. It's a half ply. We were at the Louisiana welcome center, and the TP was more convincing in its job performance. This is the kind of TP that makes you pretty sure the management didn't want to provide TP at all, but felt compelled to do so out of cultural expectation. This is begrudgingly provided toilet paper. This is toilet paper you can see through, in Cajun food country. \nThe cable doesn't seem to have been paid, or perhaps it's more parsimonious to say out tv may be broken. No channel comes in clear. And I'm not fancy. We are talking about like.. there's no CNN. That said, the pay-per-view channel is crystal clear. So, if you want to pay extra.. you know. Go for that. They definitely put their little \"tip the host\" card right on the broken tv's remote so you can associate those things together easily in your mind. I know it's not her fault, she's probably a super nice lady and the room is clean, but putting your card on a broken aspect of the room is just awkward. \nThe room is REALLY noisy. And this isn't NoLa street noise (which actually isn't that bad in this location, to Its credit), this is hotel noise. I wish I could record it for this review, but I don't know how. Theres intermittent loud beeping, like and alarm, but always the same duration so it probably isn't an alarm. There's a motor sound and a clicking\/slapping sound that go on all day and all night, with no obvious machine to blame it on. It sounds like someone is slapping shoes together to get the mud out. But they're doing an entire elementary school worth after recess in the rain. There's a blowing air sound that doesn't seem associated with any obviously blowing air. There's also a tinny rattling sound that is intermittent. It's not the end of the world, but it's over 30 stories in the air and it's still really loud. If I hadn't brought noise cancelling earphones, we would have had to request a different room because it was so loud last night. \n\nSo yea that's about it. As I said, it's habitable. But it's just habitable. Don't come here expecting to be overly comfortable because of the cost of it. It's not that kind of place from my experience, and there are so many really luxurious places in this city for the same price or cheaper, especially mid-week. But the staff are really nice.","stars":2.0}

So delicious and refreshing! \n\nThis bar has offers a lot of historical, New Orleans classics such as sazerachs, French 75s and Milk Punches. And they do the job well. My boyfriend got the Milk Punch which came with Irish whiskey, milk and...Lucky Charms?! A strange combination as it may sound, it was actually a pretty cool, delicious drink for whiskey lovers.","stars":4.0}

And if today won't work out, make sure you try this place out ASAP. It is also adorable inside, and they have a few tables outside, which was great because I got to take my pup along. Five stars.

{"text":"I hired Aadvanced Limousines for my wedding and my wife had instructed the folks on the phone exactly where they need to be dropped off 2 days before the wedding. However, the driver dropped my family off few blocks past the venue and my poor family members had to walk back in the cold wind. When we called Aadvanced Limousines back to have the driver pick them up immediately and drop them off at the exact location, the person on the phone (Christy) said that he has to go and pick up people for another wedding. She was not apologetic and helpful. \n\n\"So they were dropped off 2 blocks away! I apologize for the mess but what do you want me to do? The driver has to go to pick other customers up\" . We had photographers waiting in front of the venue to take pics of my family getting off the limousine and all those memorable pics were lost :-(\n\nI did not care to follow up with them till Monday and they completely ignored my calls till I asked my credit card to put a stop payment on half the amount, and left Aadanced Limousines (Christy) a voicemail telling her that I have put a stop payment. I got a call back within one hour and they promised that they will get back to me asap with some sort of compensation for my troubles (I was expecting them to give me a big discount for this mess). I called up my credit card company and asked them to release the hold (was being fair to them). Again I did not get a call back from Aadvanced Limousines that day or the next. I had to call them again and this time I called Christy who apologized for the mess and claimed she knew Indianapolis inside out and according to the driver everything was done well. She completely ignored to see our point of view or understand our situation. I almost put a full hold on the amount but decided to let it go (since this is a happy moment in my life) and just make sure I warn the other folks about their poor quality of customer service. \n\nWhat makes a company in the service industry successful is their ability to deal with the accolades and criticism  with the same level of interest (more for criticism) and not ignore critical calls. I am surely not going to use their service anymore, there are much better limousine companies out there and I would advise you to go to them instead. I paid a lot of money for their service and did not expect  it to be so poor. I never mind paying good money for good service. All our vendors were awesome to me and my wife except this one. I hope this review is helpful for you, especially for those who are planning to hire them for their wedding. We are still sad about the lost opportunity for pictures and wish we had used someone else.","stars":1.0}

This particular trip we got our food before we got drinks, the biscuits were cold in the middle, the gravy had no flavor and was warm at best. Now I do not mean they biscuits were not hot, I mean they were refrigerator cold. When the waitress came by we ask if she'd forgot our drinks, she said no! She stated that they had to change out the diet Coke and then she just got busy running hot food to other guest. But she did not forget. She was clear about that. We just did not have them when the food came out?? My brother had ordered an omelette and ask for light cheese, when it arrived it was all cheese and little to no meat. Final rant, ordered my eggs over easy, they were much closer to over well.

Unfortunately it did not play out well. \n\nWalking in, the hostess was rather expressionless and un-enthused. We informed her of our reservation and she told us to step to the side and that somebody will be right with us. Ok - great, not a big deal.\n\nNow for the stellar service that we were expecting. After not being greeted for some time, our server ____ informed of us of being double-sat and offered us beverages. again, not a big deal,  just not the best start.  \n\nNow for the food. I was really disappointed. They bring over these little complimentary cheese crackers. Great. Then we ordered the broiled oysters and lobster bisque for an appetizer. The oysters were just under seasoned and the bisque just ok. I've had better at black rock. So when you order a steak, they will send over a soup and salad to start. They both were pretty good actually,  the broth wasn't too salty as French onion typically is, and the salad tasted fresh. I ordered the chateaubriand and my husband the delmonico. Temp was spot on, but damn the steaks just needed a lot of love. No crust, no seasoning, and quite frankly,  the food wasn't all that warm.  The vegetables I did not touch,  they didn't sing to me at all. \n\nI will give some credit due where it's deserved, the wine and liquor was not grossly overpriced which was nice. The wine selection was spectacular. \n\nThey took us on a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar,  which was actually really cool.  That led us to the dessert room.\n\nThis was the highlight of the experience and I'm afraid to say that I wish I could just rate this separate from the dinner experience. Up some stairs and into a separate hostess stand. We were seated in a private booth right in the piano room. We ordered the peanut butter torte and that was really delicious.   \n\nAlas, berns for some fine wine, nibbles,  and dessert?  Absolutely.  For dinner? Absolutely not.","stars":2.0}

The two women up front were very friendly and helpful. From the moment I spoke to one on the phone, I can feel their enthusiasm and it was a nice way to start the morning. Saw an earlier review where someone got sick from this sandwich, definitely not the case for me. It was rly good, crisp but not dry because of the Mayo and a lot of ham was added. They won't skimp you and it definitely is a small business so show support. Very difficult to find good breakfast in the area but this place has it. Also even there coffee is good!

We ventured out into the chaos and were surprised at the amount of people. \n\nWhile they were revamping the commissary, it seemed impossible for me to find anything and they had even done away with their vegetarian selection.

{"text":"I simply cannot understand how a company that designs such brilliantly intuitive products can FAIL so miserably when it comes to making their stores accessible and friendly to the disabled.  The stores are designed for those who can walk and stand and no one else.  All the display tables are at standing height so no one in a wheelchair can comfortably view the products, options or pricing and they're placed so close together that, (in pre-COVID times) when there's people standing at them, it's IMPOSSIBLE to even get into the store in a wheelchair.  Seriously, it's like looking at the great wall of China - an impassable line of standing people and display tables.  What are we supposed to do?  Crawl under the tables? And forget about being able to navigate a wheelchair to the back of the store to the Genius Bar or to browse the accessory products hanging on the walls.\n\nYou'd think that with them limiting customers inside the stores due to COVID these issues would have improved, but no.  They are still completely hostile and unwelcoming to the disabled.  There are multiple lines out front, confusing signage, idiot associates who send you to the back of the \"appointments-for-browsing-the-store-line\" after you've told them repeatedly that you're there for a pre-paid, pick-up and absolutely NO PLACE to sit if you have limited mobility and cannot stand for any length of time.  And if they do offer you a chair?  It turns out to be a cafe-height stool that's IMPOSSIBLE to get onto if you have limited mobility.\n\nApple seriously needs to do BETTER for the disabled.","stars":1.0}

It stopped just long enough for me to get home. Fast forward to my second opinion at a highly rated mechanic and it turns out that my car certainly did NOT need anywhere near $1,700 in work...AND... Brake Masters bent my brake hardware so that had to be replaced. The new mechanic did everything my car needed done, including new brake hardware (thanks Brake Masters) and my oil change for $280. Wow! I'm so glad I left. As a side note, while I was waiting to receive the outrageous quote, 2 separate people came in to Brake Masters disputing the recent work they had done. Red flags!!

{"text":"Average. That's the word I keep coming back to. There are parts of this hotel that look incredibly dated, and the first impression I got walking in is that it's an old hotel. Once you get into the room it looks like the furniture is recent but the wallpaper and air conditioner are not. The bathroom is small and old but clean. The room itself is good sized. Service is a mixed bag. Some people are good at customer service, some aren't. It's the luck of the draw. The hallways aren't as clean as they should be. But the bed is comfortable and the sheets clean. \n\nBreakfast is fairly good. As is typical for a hotel it's overpriced for what you get. The restaurant staff is attentive and there's a nice view of the arch in the dining room. \n\nI ate in the lounge one night; the food wasn't bad but wasn't outstanding. The service at the bar was lacking. The bartender doted on regulars and talked to her friends but left me waiting a lot. \n\nPro tip: self park your car. Besides the self parking being $10\/day instead of $20 for valet, the valet situation is horrid. You're recommended to call down for your car 20 minutes ahead of time. So the drive fills up with cars waiting to be claimed. Meanwhile the attendant will leave you waiting. And waiting. And waiting longer than 20 minutes. Don't bother. \n\nThe rates here are cheaper than the others nearby, but the other hotels are nicer. It's not a dump, but just know that there are some trade offs for a low rate.","stars":3.0}

I ordered the Indian pancake; which is very popular and I got duck with ginger. 5 mins after I've ordered, my pancake arrived. It was very good with the compliments of the curry to go with it. It was freshly made, flakey, and easy to pull. The curry had a nice texture, good spices, and it wasnt overly spicy. Now here's where the missing star comes in. About 15 - 20 mins later, my duck finally came out. It took alittle long to come out. When it came out, it smelled good and the duck looked tender; which it was. The sauce had a nice body, nice consistency, and tasted very good. But when I had it with the rice, the rice tasted like it was old. But the real smack in the face is that this is an Asian restaurant..... how do u mess up on rice? It's like going to a taco restaurant and the tortillas is hard. I'm Asian and I know what is  freshly made rice vs old rice lol. So I just ate the duck and left the rice alone. The service was pretty slow tbh. It took 15 mins for my duck to come out and it took about 10 mins to get a waiter for my check. I work in a restaurant and I understand how customers are, but the restaurant wasn't even full or even half full when I was waiting for my duck. But to wait 15 mins to get old rice? C'mon.... but since the pancake, curry, and the duck was delicious, I have to give 4\/5 despite having slow service and the rice being old or frozen.","stars":4.0}

Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and made great recommendations. \n\nFOOD\n\nAsian Caesar Salad: It was a huge portion. My Bf said it was heavy but maybe that was because of all the cashews they put in there instead of actual croutons. It was fresh and crunch and well coated with dressing. \n\nYellowtail Sashimi: I enjoyed the thinly slice Jalape\u00f1o on top of it. I don't love yellowtail but since it didn't really have much of a choice I chose that as a starter. But if you like yellowtail the. This would be great!\n\nChilean Sea Bass: We both got that dish. It was just a great piece of fish and the dish lives up to the hype. Do yourself a favor and get this dish! It come with a little bit of veggies at the bottom (crunchy string beans and saut\u00e9 mushrooms)\n\nLobster Fried Rice: Was delicious and was a great addition to our meal. This made us SUPER full.

According to the advertising, this company is experienced with full-service packing and crating with professionally trained employees. The website highlights \"shrink wrap and professional furniture pads, specialized equipment to speed your move, and a fully equipped moving truck.\"\n\nThe moving team arrived 3 hours late (11am) in a Penske truck with excuses about a thunderstorm the previous night.  It took 5 and a half hours to load the contents of our 2-bedroom apartment which was all previously boxed. The only dismantling necessary was that of our bed. Even with a planned 8am start, they arrived at our destination at 10:30pm, and finished unloading at 1am.  At that time, they requested most of the payment be by check, with $100 in cash.\n\nWe waited for their late arrival at our initial location before starting on the 5-hr drive ourselves, causing us to miss our cable and internet installation appointment at our destination, and further delaying installation for several days.  Although simply a matter of inconvenience, the lack of internet precluded us from attending to work-related duties.\n\nAlthough polite, we were highly disappointed in their overall service which culminated in damage to many of our belongings.  There were nicks, scratches, gouges, and damage to most of our wood furniture as well as tears in our leather couch.  Our picture frames and professional diplomas were scratched, and some of our fragile boxes were crushed. One of our framed pictures is also missing.\n\nWe contacted Express Movers and Storage 2 days later to inform them of the damage to our property, and were told to send an e-mail with the information in order to process a claim.  This was the beginning of a 3-week process during which the only response was to our initial e-mail asking for 2-4 days.  The rest of my e-mails asking about an update as to what has been done have gone unanswered.  Several phone calls have also gone unanswered.  Upon blocking my phone number, the phone was finally answered, and I reached an employee who told me the owner was unavailable.  I was told that a claim had been filed on July 7, typically takes 7 days, and that I would receive a call from the owner the next day.  2 months later, I have heard nothing from this company.

Not far away from the Riverwalk area and the French Quarter (well within walking distance). Also, I know it is not so much a hotel feature but Uber drivers are familiar with the courtyard area so drop-off and pickup are easy. The balcony off the suite is an interesting feature but overlooking the casino there was not much of a reason to open it up. My only real complaint was waiting for hot water in the shower. For being here four days with early (as in before 6:30 AM pickup calls) it might have been just a timing issue so the jury is still out on that point. Also, not that it was important to me but I thought I overheard someone looking for a complimentary breakfast service and if I heard correctly they don't have one.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Uh yeah.... So this place was just ok. I expected more since every time I come to New Orleans there is a very long line outside. I came down with a group for new years, and since the sugar bowl crowd wasn't in town yet and there was no line outside, we decided to check it out. \n\nSince we had a large group we told one person to sit down and reserve a table... Big mistake. A worker promptly came over and said \"you need a receipt before you can sit down,\" even though there was hardly a line inside... O well. \n\nI am happy I read the yelp reviews before coming here that warned you to \"know what you want\" before it is time to order because as soon as you walk up to the counter, the uninviting workers rushed you through the process. My sister made the mistake of trying to order a water after being told the price. The worker kept repeating the price louder and louder as my sister asked for water, and the worker finally said, \"they will give it to you at the table.\" The attitude of the worker was unnecessary. I don't understand why she didn't say that when my sister first asked. \n\nOnce we sat down we noticed a sign that said \"no tipping\" but when our waiter came over, the first thing she said was \"Feel free to tip if I do a good job!\" HUH?!?! Needless to say we were all confused, but since she was so sweet (the only nice person we encountered here) I did in the end. \n\nAs for the food, I wasnt a fan of the ettouffee. It was too bland in my opinion. One person in our group ordered the jambalaya, I thought the flavors in that were very good, but there was very little meat. \n\nBeing originally from Louisiana, this restaurant embarrassed me...From the food to the staff to the confusing signs. As for the warehouse looking interior that some people have complained about, that is typical rustic new orleans and I didn't have an issue with it.\n\nThis will not be on the top of my list of places to visit next time I return to new Orleans... If it even makes the list....","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town, hands down. Get the Don Julio Silver ones with the little bottle and you'll be hooked (ask the waiter). I hate tequila, but I'll drink it here. Their food is also awesome - it's light and fresh without oils and grease. They use fresh produce and seafoods from local sources as well.\n\nThis place isn't a road side taqueria or a taco truck, this is fusion mexican food, meaning mexican with an american twist (no grease\/oils, organic greens, freshly made, etc). If you want your gut bomb after drinking until 2am, hit up Freebirds in IV or Cucas on the Mesa. \n\nI've gone here for everything from a fancy first date to a birthday party and I've never left unhappy. I especially appreciate the live music they have there in the evenings. It's usually a very simple 1 to 3 piece band playing light and simple latin melodies - nothing loud or obnoxious to take away from the atmosphere, since most of the seating is outside under umbrellas.\n\nFor me, if I'm looking for a slightly fancy place with awesome food, Carlitos is the place I'd go and the place I recommend to my friends. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I have been to Epic Shine prior to COVID and been very happy with the service and cleanliness of my car. \n\nHowever, I went through June 25th and got the $15.99 wash with rain guarentee. I had been traveling and had ALOT of bugs which had never been an issue before. My car went through the first time and came out with bugs. There wasn't an attendant to be found so I used my wash code to go through again. After a second wash, still had grill bugs. I vacuumed my car and was waiting to see an attendant. About 10 minutes later, I finally saw someone who worked there and let them know that they didn't have any clean towels to dry off my car. I had given up on getting the bugs off at this point.  Waiting again, for 20 more minutes, and no clean towels ever came. I am thoroughly disappointed with what used to be a great value. Sorry Epic Shine no 5 star this roaptrip!","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Oh Sparky's, where do I begin my story of my love affair with you?\n\nI've drank far too much in you far too many times. I have had countless hangovers due to your fantastic pours, your great prices, and your pizza that doesn't soak up an ounce of booze from my system.\n\nI've fallen in and out of love in your establishment. Hearts filled and broken, battles won and lost, drinks had and then regurgitated. And yet, I love you still Sparky's.\n\nDave, your bartender, is one of my favorite servers in all of Reno. He makes my drinks strong, he keeps them coming, and he knows my home address to tell the cab when I need a ride home but am at the moment convinced I am some sort of mutant hybrid of Jesus, Jim Morrison and Hunter S Thompson all rolled up into one very loud wrecking machine. \n\nEvery trip to Reno has involved a trip to come see you since I left. We went in last time, and somehow I drank my buddy's 98lb girlfriend into a hangover that lasted until 6:00 the next night. She knew she couldn't keep up with 250lb of stupid, but Sparky's, you inspired her to hang on.\n\nWhen the Wild Bunch and I would tube down the Truckee we would get out at McCarran, walk up the bridge, and into Sparkys to up our BAC before getting back in the river. Unlike some of the down town establishments, no one even batted an eye when 12 of us came in smelling like the river, tubes in hand, demanding booze. \n\nSparky's on McCarran, you are my tavern away from home. I love you.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel for 3 days and was very pleased with the amenities and services provided. \n\nThe positive aspects were the COVID protocols they followed. The room was sealed off with a sticker indicating it was cleaned. The remote was placed in a bag also indicating it was clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had to replace a taillight and staff went to get all the tools for me to borrow. The final positive aspect is security in the hotel. To get into the hotel you have to use a keycard or main lobby door. \n\nThe only negative aspect was the parking garage. It contains tight turns and spots. When parking you need to be careful backing up or you might end up striking a pole.","stars":5.0}

We didnt want to make a big deal because it appeared they had some  important people (all in tailored suits) dining there next to us that day , so we asked to box what we didnt continue to eat after finding the foreign objects in our food and threw it out when we left.

Not very flavorful and very standard fare...but not bad enough to scratch it off our list, until now...  I think we are officially breaking up Miguel, you've got no sizzle in your fajitas (literally) and you're a little bland.  I ordered a #1 and really just tasted cheese I'm pretty sure and nothing else.  The taco tortilla texture was good...fried like Jimboys...I am a sucker for corn tortillas cooked that way!!  I'm not a food snob...swear.  But I am now certain that Taco Bell is closer and tastier at least to my unsophisticated palette.  The service is standard...not bad, but not great.

{"text":"What better place to review than the OLDEST bar in the country for my 400th review?  I can't think of one.  This was a must-visit place my friends raved about for most of the trip down to NOLA.  Located a bit off the beaten track- which I love- the bar definitely has an old-timey vibe with low lighting and rich, deep wooden architecture inside.  The bar wraps around where it was great to discover a pianist playing and singing the oldies away.  I will say that both of the times I walked in here, we could pretty much only enter at the bar and walk out on the street with our drinks because it was so crowded; thus, we couldn't really enjoy the experience as we would have liked.  However, the hurricanes here were the best that I had on the entire trip.  Screw the other side of Bourbon Street and come down the other way for your hurricane needs.","stars":4.0}

They either know someone who works there or know the chef is on Top Chef and that's why they posted something. I doubt they were even there and Yelp needs to do a better job filtering out that garbage. Moving on.\n\nHad dinner here last night - sensational.\n\nWe had the Mackerel, gnocchi, scallop, trout, foie gras and pork. \n\nThe scallop was raw but a very nice presentation and taste to. It was fishy but not too fishy, done very well.\n\nFoie gras. Probably one of the best I've had in the city.\n\nGnocchi. I personally thought there was too much bacon flavor and some kind of vinegar or citrus flavor that overwhelmed the dish. I wasn't really crazy about the texture or size of the gnocchi either. \n\nTrout. It was really fresh and the sauce was phenomenal. \n\nMackerel. This was probably my favorite. It was cooked rare and perfectly seasoned.\n\nPork. Very good, second favorite. It came with different parts of the pig, like shoulder, belly and chops. Very well done.\n\n\nService was great. Only saw them when we needed something. Nicolas served us dessert and spoke with us for a few minutes about Top Chef which was really awesome.

She removed my stubborn callous at the ball of my foot without any issues. I was impressed with how she smoothed out my heels. My toes turned out amazing and my mom loved hers. She chose Fine Vermilion (an orange shade) and I picked out Nordic Lights (a sparkly purple).\n\nWhen it came to our manicures, I really appreciated the time and effort Krissy spent on my cuticles, which were really dry. I asked for a CND Shellac mani since I'd never had one before (but I've had gel in the past). I LOVE Shellac. It's so much quicker and easier than a gel mani. I chose Asphalt for my base shade, then asked Krissy to create nail art with the additives. She used a blue to teal pigment and holographic sparkle pigment to create a gradient on top of the base color. My nails turned out amazing! The color is complex and beautiful. My mom asked for a more subtle orange for her mani in the Vinylux and Krissy suggested Salmon Run, which she loved.\n\nWe both loved the experience and will be back!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I ate at this Olive Garden because it's a chain and I assumed it would be safe. It was a tuesday night and not particularly busy. I attended the restaurant with a new friend and our children - not an auspicious choice. It took 45 minutes to even get soup and it was cold when we did. The children became increasingly agitated as the wait for their meals dragged on. The food came easily 30 minutes after the soup. Despite coming comfortably 2 hours before close we ended up being there until after closing. Upon leaving both of the kids left something in the restaurant and the staff was very unwilling to even open the dorr to see what we needed despite having literally just left.

{"text":"Mi Nidito Restaurant was the best restaurant we ate at during our long weekend in Tucson.  It's famous for the famous people who dine here when in town, so the line can be daunting; but I recommend eating at Mi Nidito if it's your first time to Tucson. \n\nWe did our homework and found out that one of said famous people who have eaten at Mi Nidito was Bill Clinton.  In fact, there is even a plate named after his dinner meal called most-appropriately, President's Plate.  From what I learned, the President didn't know what he wanted to order, so told the kitchen to make him a little bit of everything.  It's the best deal of the place. \n\nPresident's Plate comes with a bean tostada, a birria taco, a chile relleno, a chicken enchilada and a beef tamale.  All this for less than 20 bucks!  You also get two baskets of complimentary chips and salsa with your meal - and trust me when I say you won't run out of chips because they give you A LOT of chips in the basket!  I ordered the president's plate and it was delicious. \n\nI didn't make much of a dent in the plate because there was so much food!  Of everything on the plate, I liked the chicken enchilada the best.  Chicken was tender, but not dry and the enchilada sauce was full of flavor.  But again, you can't go wrong with anything from this plate, since you're getting such a variety of protein, flavors and textures.  I recommend it.\n\nGet on the long list of names waiting for a table and be on alert for when your name is called through the speaker because no, they do not call or text you, so you can't walk off the premises and do something else in the meantime.  Like many who came before and after us, we found a bench and sat for an hour.  Food was delicious though.  I'm glad we checked out what seems to be the place to eat at in Tucson.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I travel nearly a 100 nights a year and am a complete foodie.  I truly enjoy coming to NOLA several times of year to indulge in the cuisine.  I really enjoy John Besh (I DVR all his shows on PBS) and was excited to try Borgne.  My companion and I arrived for our 6:30 reservation.  The restaurant was half full.  They sat us next to the exit door of the kitchen.   With all the available seats around... Why?  I asked to be moved which they did with a smile.  The first course was oysters on the half shell.  They were delicious.  We then ordered the smoked pork empanadas and turkey neck.  The empanadas were OK.. The pie crust was very bready and meat on the dry side, but good flavor.  The creole dipping sauce was simply overpowering for the empanadas.  I dipped an empananda in the sauce from the turkey neck and it was a perfect compliment.  The turkey neck itself was quite a flavorful surprise and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I ordered a local craft brew and it was really nice.  When I ordered a second one, it came in a ridiculously heavy goblet that is normally reserved for cheap margaritas in a tex-mex establishment.  I asked why and the server said it just depends on who was pouring behind the bar?  Really?? A pint should be a pint consistently served in this level of restaurant.  The vibe of the place was wrong.. My companion hit it straight on.. This place isn't comfortable.  Plastic chairs, sterile d\u00e9core.  Nothing that speaks to the food.  We decided to go elsewhere for our entrees simply because we wanted a NOLA feel.  This doesn't make Borgne a bad restaurant, but not what I had hoped for seeing how I respect Besh's approach to food in the many interviews I have seen of him.. We will look forward to trying his other places in town.","stars":2.0}

They had signs posted that only 5 people were allowed in the lobby at a time which I thought was really great! They were sanitizing pens and taking steps to help people stay far apart. The food was great as per usual. The ranch is great and tasted really good with the fries. I recommend the dynamite shrimp wrap","stars":5.0}

Reason why I waited so long was because I had heard good things about this place and I was willing to try it out. The ladies there are so rude and I felt discriminated.

I for sure will NOT recommend it to any of my friends or family !","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Dimples is a staple in the massive Maryland Farms business district, a local delicatessen offering freshly-made sandwiches, breakfast food, and desserts. It's literally minutes from my house and I've meant to try it for years. Blending in with the surrounding businesses in a mundane strip mall, it doesn't stand out from the road. But my mother-in-law highly recommended it, having been there many times.\n\nSo I finally scoured the menu in advance, made my game plan, and anxiously arrived at Dimples one afternoon. With a solid recommendation, a good looking menu, and its close proximity to my house, I was prepared to make this my regular spot. I couldn't wait!!!\n\nRather than welcoming me into their restaurant, the woman behind the counter glared at me as I ordered, seemingly unamused with life in general. Sure, the \"Welcome to Moe's!!!\" chant that employees are required to offer up when you enter their taco shop seems a little forced, but at least it makes you feel welcome.\n\nAs I asked questions about the sandwich I was ordering, always fearful that a cook will smear disgusting mayonnaise all over a sandwich, or loads of slimy tomatoes, or other condiments I dislike, I wanted to make sure that my order only contains things I like; spicy mustard, banana peppers, provolone cheese, things like that. The woman grew incredibly impatient and was terribly rude, acting astonished that I was asking her one, maybe two questions tops! How dare I? Well, I guess I must be the only Naahvillian who doesn't know what comes on the sandwiches at Dimples!!!\n\nAfter humiliating me in front of other customers, I embarrassingly completed my order. The woman rolled her eyes, placed the order, and took my money, as if they'll do just fine whether or not I become a loyal customer.\n\nAs the third generation in my family to work in the restaurant industry, there are two things that I will not tolerate from a server or cashier taking my order, two things that are inexcusable in the world of food service.\nRule #1: Never be rude to a customer.\nRule #2: Never let my water glass reach empty.\nI don't require anything else from the person taking my order, and subsequently taking my money. You don't have to be peppy, you don't have to be my friend, you don't have to ask me if I need anything else 500 times. Just keep the water glass full and exhibit a modicum of politeness. Everything beyond that is the chef's responsibility; timely preparation, quality of food, presentation.\n\nAlready jaded, I subtracted two Yelp stars in my mind and was still willing to give Dimples a 3. But after behaving like it was my privilege for being allowed into their amazing restaurant, the sandwich wasn't that amazing after all! It was good, but it wasn't Katz's Delicatessen good. So Dimples, you get 2 stars.\n\nMoral of the story: Dimples doesn't care if you come to their restaurant or not. They can survive without you. And if you do brave lunch here, don't you DARE ask any questions about the menu.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I love this place!  I have only been there Wednesday nights where they have their awesome 2 for 1 fajita night.  You can choose between the steak, chicken or the combination of both.  I always go for the chicken since I do not eat red meat or pork and love how every time it is tender, juicy and seasoned just right.  It is a great atmosphere and the service is fast and efficient.  The endless salad bowl is fantastic where they mix the special house dressing in at your table, the rolls you receive before your meal are always warm and fresh, plus they have this tasty cinnamon butter to go with it.   The tortillas are always fresh and they give you plenty of meat on the skillet mixed with sauteed onions, that you are sure to bring a box of leftovers home.  I have seen other people order other things that look just as scrumptious however, i have only had that one meal every time (it is hard to stray away!!!)  I definitely recommend trying this restaurant if you are in the area!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Let me put it this way - if you are looking for a good biryani in St. Louis, there are plenty of really good options from West County to O Fallon suburbs. Even home catering outfits make a decent biryani if you know where to go. So for a new restaurant to come into St Louis and claim they make the best biryani around, it better be spectacular! From the 2 stars I've given this place, it's obvious they are far from being anywhere close to it!\n\nWe visited this place during Father's Day lunch and had a terrible experience. But what prompted me to write this review was a catered dinner event that I had at a friends place where the food was provided by Paradise. The quality of the food was a travesty and if it were me, I would take it back to this restaurant and demand they get out of the food business. Horrible food prepared by someone who appears to have been given instructions over the phone in a foreign language! Of the 3 main dishes that were ordered, the base curry all tasted the same and the only difference was one had meat, the other had paneer and the third had a hodgepodge of vegetables throw in! This would have been okay if it actually tasted good but it appeared to be stale chicken, paneer and vegetables that were defrosted to make a mess!\n\nThe experience at Father's Day lunch was a little different. This time it was a $13 per person lunch buffet that had literally nothing left in the buffet at noon. People were made to wait outside for an hour and once you were seated, it was another long line at the buffet waiting for someone to refill the dishes. Of the dozen or so items on the buffet we may have got to try about 4 which we had to scrape off the bottom after waiting in line for at least 30 additional minutes. The owner was genuinely apologetic but he seemed to do nothing about stopping people from coming in despite the food being over!\n\nThis place does not deserve to be around and ride on the success of the original Paradise restaurant in Hyderabad (they claim no affiliation to this chain!). If these guys need to survive they have to get their act together and not rip off their customers. St Louis deserves better than this!","stars":2.0}
{"text":"When you first walk in to the hotel there's a cute little lobby area with limited seating and a nice breakfast area. The parking was not very good. I had to search for quite some time to find a place to park. At first appearances on the outside, I was like \"Oh s***!\" But when I got inside, I was comforted because it was very clean and orderly. The person who greeted me was very professional and friendly. My room was on the second floor and when I stepped off of the elevator I smelled a little musty odor. I was really concerned that it was not going to be a good stay but I changed once I stepped into my room. I got King bed room. It wasn't as updated as the other Fairfield Inns that I've stayed in but it had all of the basics. It had a 42 inch TV, a refrigerator, a microwav,  and a small coffee maker. The carpets were clean, too. I always check the bed and there were no signs of bed bugs or bugs of any kind. The bathroom is nothing special. There was a little rust around the drain hole in the tub but it was clean. The highlight of my stay was the Paul Mitchell products. I washed my hair in that wonderful smelling Tea Tree shampoo and that Lemon Sage conditioner. It was awesome! I also enjoyed the Lemon Sage body wash. I usually use my own soap but it smelled so refreshing and clean that I continued to use it throughout my stay. One thing that kind of spooked me was I was getting out of the shower and I happened to look up at the fan and there was a little green light inside of the fan! Now anyone who has watched any of those creepy movies where there's a stalker who uses cameras to spy on their victims, a little, hidden,  flashing light in the bathroom fan makes you wonder... So, I called down and the receptionist didn't know why the light was there but she called maintenance and then when they didn't call back she went into one of the rooms and saw the light in that room too. She asked a manager and the manager said she's not quite sure what it was but it's in every room so it might be some kind of Sanitation or air filter or something like that but it was pretty damn creepy! I don't know y'all. \n\nAnyhoo, Breakfast is served from 6:30 a.m. to 10 am. They had the standard fare of hot breakfast including eggs, sausage, tater tots, and biscuits. You can even make your own waffles. I didn't see the waffle mix so it might not have been offered right now. And if you're in a hurry and have to get to work, they have to-go boxes and a nice woman who fixed me a to-go box. It wasn't a bad stay for the price point.","stars":3.0}

The only thing I wish they did a little better was their sides, and in some cases their cooking times. The samosas have usually been sitting in the warmer for a while, so they're no longer crispy, and the rice and curried lentils and other things are all just aight. Again, the grill is where this place shines.\n\nI've eaten in, and I've taken out, and I've learned that when I want some Kabobeesh, I call 30-45 minutes ahead to make sure whatever I'm getting is ready.\n\nIt's totally worth the wait, and it's damn cheap for what you get, but yeah - if you're hungry, you might want to get something in your stomach before coming here.","stars":3.0}

Our server was a sweet lady with a slow southern accent, who had the heart to overlook two 18 month old teething toddlers who lack social grace to put it nicely. (Which undoubtedly earned her a 30% tip).  \n\n I'll be the first to admit, I am a picky eater but I was so delightfully surprised at how good the breakfast was. My eggs, ordered over easy were cooked to perfection. The sausage patty wasn't greasy and the pancakes tasted like doughnuts. Even the hash browns were crispy just like I love them! (Did I cook this breakfast in a dream?) Oh, and the homemade buttermilk biscuits? I enjoyed every bite of it until my daughter decided I had had enough and launched it to the next booth like she was being scouted for the New York Yankees. Seriously, where did she get that arm? I can't wait to return here -sans kids- and enjoy another round of sweet, southern hospitality and a well done breakfast. Just try it and if you think I'm wrong, well breakfast is on me.

{"text":"So... Fall 2018. I come back to IV to find out that WakeCup is now under new management. Hopefully that means good things, because the previous management made it so that Mojo's Teahouse is now the primary boba place to go to, which can also be attributed to Mojo's tight priority on quality.\n\nInside it looks very clean. The new management cleaned up the place, rearranged things, while also retaining some aspects of the previous WakeCup, such as the Post-It wall.\n\nI ordered the Matcha Green milk tea. Stupid thing is, I thought the matcha was made with a base green tea, making it eligible for the 50%, but... it was probably my dealings with the previous management that made me to associate it, a sign that they weren't that focused on quality.\n\nThe matcha was pretty very decent. I could taste it, and it wasn't diluted somewhat. The boba could use a little work. It was a bit too... sweet. Tone down the sweetness a bit, I'm not trying to get a cavity. \n\nWhat I feel is that the new management needs to be kept on its toes, especially since it now has Mojo's to contend with for customers. The quality can not deteriorate nor can the cleanliness, because that was what drove away customers who don't frequent boba places periodically from WakeCup, in essence the previous management's handling in the first place. It does not help matters that IV, despite being a very good place for restaurants to set up shop to cater to college students, has been proven to have the opposite effect, with Otaco, HiWi, and other restaurants, close up due to poor sales. \n\nI'm not saying the place has to be on par on places like Boba Guys or Boba Time in terms in taste, they just have to maintain a consistently good quality for everything they produce to keep attracting customers. If they slack off, WakeCup will definitely continue changing management","stars":4.0}

I do love the staff they are really great people, and they have tried to help me and I have had a lot of dental problems, however I am not from New Orleans, I am traveling around the country in an RV, this morning I saw Dr. Troy Patterson and although his intention was to help, he decided instead to scream at me because I have been so frustrated of all the dental problems I have had lately. I am mentally ill, I have severe depression and anxiety, I felt totally disrespected. This is the situation: if you are from a civilized state such as California and you aren't used to, um Southern gentlemen with really bad breath telling you that you are uneducated, telling you that you are disrespecting him, if you are a woman or from a civilized state then do not go to this man.

So on a bright warm day, I ended up dropping by a place called Redlan's Gentleman's Grooming.

Wow, there are so many things I can say that I will not say here. What a rude individual. It will be a wonder this bar will stay open with this \"positive\" attitude; boy, are places closing down fast around here we have no place else to go have fun. \nMy date and I debated about giving Busted Shovel any business and we went to the bar next door. The Frontier is clearly hopping because they have more professionalism than the Busted Shovel will ever have again.","stars":1.0}

Most people were just overcharged on tip!  Horrible slow service, drinks and food forgotten, bad attitude on waiter etc! The valet also charges $5 which is not posted anywhere and the punk behind the window has a bad attitude.

It's best shared, although not impossible to finish alone. \nBarrio has a nice variety of beer, which can be enjoyed inside or on the patio. Our group tried different entrees, and I had the Sonoran dogs. They were pretty good, but I was a little disappointed. \nThe location is near Downtown in a warehouse district, and can be hard to find. \nIt's worth checking out, and a good addition to Tucson's growing microbrew scene.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight, and shocked to find what was once my favorite bar in the Quarter, completely changed.  Apparently, it's been sold to new owners and it's awful.  Everything that made this place awesome, down to the rugs, quirky lamps, and Russian decor, has been taken out.  It now looks like your run-of-the-mill bar that could be found in Anywhere, USA.  Terrible idea to sell, and worse idea to change the bar at all.  Absolutely pitiful.  You're better off heading to Molly's on the Market, a few doors down.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"This is your average Chinese takeout place. Combo platters run around $7 and come with pork fried rice and an egg roll. The sesame chicken was pretty average: a high fried-batter-to-chicken ratio, and the sauce was tooth-numbingly sweet. Seriously, they could use that sauce in place of Novocaine. It came with 2 pieces of steamed broccoli which were extremely bland, but I guess that's just what happens when you steam vegetables. Plus, I guess something has to balance out the supersweet sauce. The fried rice was fine, it wasn't as heavy and greasy as fried rice from a Chinese takeout place can be. The veggie dumplings were just okay, but then again I like my dumplings with meat, so maybe the lack of meat was the problem there. \n\nOn the other hand, the scallion pancakes were good. They were on the thinner side and not super greasy, the way scallion pancakes should be. The lo mein looked decent as well. The french fries were really good too, with the dimensions of McDonald's fries but crisper, less salty, and not soggy at all. \n\nI guess the food here is less heavy and greasy than China Inn, and seems fresher. If you have a craving for greasy Chinese, this place is not it. Overall, it's decent takeout if you live in the area, but I would by no means go out of my way to eat here.","stars":3.0}

There was only 1 wait staff, Roger, who as it turns out, is also the owner. Roger was very personable and funny. We had a few laughs with him as we decided on our meals. We both decided on lunch specials. I had the Hawaiian Fried Rice and my friend had Green Curry. I was hoping for some good miso soup and I was not disappointed. My dining companion loves soup and most especially loved Ahi Asian Bistro's. It is a small restaurant but I believe there are 2 tables outside. They do ask that you mask up when not eating which is a good idea if you can manage it. We both certainly enjoyed our meals and will be returning to sample some of the other sushi and tempura dishes.

{"text":"We came to Olivia during opening night and were a bit hesitant as most of our opening night visits have had bad outcomes. However, Olivia is the exception, we were blown away with their amazing service and phenomenal food. \n\nOlivia is a play on some traditional Italian dishes and the menu is seperated the Italian way : pasta dishes, sides and main dishes (containing protein). You could order one pasta dish with a main dish to share with two people. \nThey also had an amazing wine and cocktail list.\n\nWe started with the appetizers: ciccoli fritto & lobster toast. Highly recommend the lobster toast ($18) - open faced toast with lemon burrata + spicy uni aioli topped with lobster and tomatoes. It was our favorite dish of the night. We could have just eaten that, went home and been happy! The ciccoli were essentially fried dough squares with honey and you lather on fig butter and cheese and top it with the slices of prosciutto! Yummy but would skip next time because it was very heavy.\n\nAs for our dishes- I got the Gnudi which are essentially gnocchi dumplings! But instead of potato it is usually made with semolina and stuffed with cheese. Denser and more satisfying than gnocchi. The dish is then made with a lemon butter sauce and pistachios. So unique and amazing. Our second favorite dish of the night was the scallops. Perfectly charred over butternut squash risotto and chestnuts. Beautifully made dish.\n\nFor dessert - we had the apple torte which was a play on apple pie with crumble cake topped with vanilla gelato.\n\nAnother great restaurant by Chef Ponte, bravo.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This past weekend, February 5-7 my two sisters and I stayed at the Clarion\nHotel in Tucson, located at 750 Starr Pass, Tucson, AZ. which was booked through hotels.com.  The room we were assigned (#220) was unacceptable, unclean, in disrepair and, frankly\ndangerous.  Sheetrock actually fell from the ceiling during our stay.  I have pictures that do not convey the decrepit shape of this room.  When we\ncomplained and asked for another room, we were told they were full.  When\nwe asked for an adjustment on our bill, one person told us our stay would\nbe complimentary, until she was later over-ruled by the manager Tammy.  The\nmanager was rude and totally unresponsive.  We left early as a result of\nthis experience.  Tammy, the manager also promised to repair the room while we were away and when we returned at 3, the room was not repaired or even cleaned.  While ultimately an adjustment was made, NO amount of\nmoney was reasonable for this room.  The website photos for this hotel\nwere not representative of its condition generally or our room\nspecifically.  The rating and quality of hotel was grossly misrepresented.\nWe will never stay at a Clarion again.  This experience ruined our\nvacation.

{"text":"This was the WORST experience at a tattoo shop I've EVER experienced. I am covered in tattoos from lots of different people and this was by far the most disrespectful, rude, disgusting and mean tattoo artist EVER Moses Martinez. Came in to get matching tattoos with my aunt and cousin. My aunt called Friday to see if we could get an appointment, the person on the phone told her we could come in at 6:00 Sunday evening to surprise my cousin for her birthday with the tattoos. We walk into the shop at 5:36 and immediately we could tell something was off, what tattoo shop have you ever been in that isn't playing music? Anyway after waiting about 40 minutes the guy (who never introduced himself to us, never asked our names nothing) came up and asked us what we wanted. We showed him the picture we picked out as a reference. he was extremely rude to my aunt telling her that he remembers talking to her over the phone and she was very \"persistent\" and that she was needy. So we gave him the pic for reference and he starts drawing it. Mind you this tattoo is of a cactus it's is only line work and it's very basic and we only wanted it about 2\"x 2\". It took him 30 minutes to TRACE it!! Once he drew it he showed us and we were set to start. We walk over to his station and he continuously tells us how we are to much and we stress him out, he feels sorry for our dad and he can't deal with us. The entire time we weren't even talking to him! Like I said before I have lots of tattoos and he was making comments about my tattoo artist (who\nIs in Peoria AZ) and blah blah. My aunt is going first so she walks behind the wall and is getting the stencil on and he's commenting about how he can't handle us and we stress him out yet again, the whole time he's setting up he is making these comments. He finally gets the stencil on her and it's way off to one side, it looks weird. She comes out of the station and asks us to look because it's on the back of her leg and she can't see it well. I tell her that I think it should move over to the left a little bit because it looks to far to the right. I took a picture for her (which I will add to this review so that everyone can see how off it was) she agreed with me and he starts getting mad at me telling me that I'm wrong and it lined up and that I don't know anything. So I said look if this is such a problem for you we don't have to do this, he was sitting on the floor and jumped up and got in my face like he was going to hit me. I am a girl. Then he proceeded to yell at me that I have an attitude (because I wanted him to move the tattoo over a little bit). Needless to say my aunt and cousin both thought he was going to hit me, as did I. So we walked out and left. He never told us his name but I will be calling to complain in the morning and I will find out his name and edit this post. Beware don't go here unless you want to be treated like shit and have a grown man act like he is going to hit you as a female. MOSES is complete trash, disrespectful to women and an all around asshole. \n\nUpdate: called and spoke with the \"manager\" and he was an even bigger dick than the artist. He told us that it is our fault and that he wouldn't give us the artists name. He told me that the customer isn't right in tattoo shops. That's funny because if you are putting something on my body forever I think I get to have a say as to how it goes. So do yourself a favor and don't ever go here.\n\nUpdate #2 figured it out assholes his fucking name is Moses Martinez.","stars":1.0}

I heard such great things about it was described pretty similar to  the well-known Houston's here in New Orleans. Metairie has 2 location. We ended up selecting the newest location of the 2 which recently opened in Elmwood in a prime location. Plenty of parking.\nHosted a party of 5 for a birthday party. Greeted by wonderful hostesses the door. Chill-low key ambiance.\nNow before I get into the food, I wanna make a note that I called ahead to see if they had a kids menu and if there was an age limit in which it was told \"No.\"\nGetting to being sat and being greeted by our server Cecilia whom seemed either a fairly new server or just plan nervous. Either way, she was not in her element as it would be expected in this type of establishment. Upon a few of the individuals ordering drinks, multiple drinks were made incorrectly and\/or wrong liquor used within the drink ordered. On one of my guest orders a French 75 that 1st came out completely wrong, then after getting the replacement it came out hot. Another guest order a Prosecco that came out warm and had re-ordered another one that the server never brought out. A drink was also ordered by a guest that she wanted made with Cognac. The server then stated tol her that the drink is only made with Gin in which my guest replied it can be made either with Gon OR Cognac in which the server stated, here we only make it with Gin. Now, mind you, the person ordering the drink is a well-known bar tender at G.W. Finns. The server then refuted and stated she would ask someone in which came back and advised it would be made with cognac. It seemed the server was more trying to ensure she was trying to possibly follow rules instead of ensuring the customers were taken care of.\nFood and appetizers were ordered. Apps for those that ordered came out well.\n\nIt was time for main food meals to be ordered. With me being on a intermediate carb fast, in ordered from the kids menu to ensure I control my portions not over-eat. About 3 minutes or so later after taking our order, the server returned and stated her manager told her that the kids menu is only for those ages 10 and lower and\/or only IF You order 2 or more items. I advised I called up to the restaurant prior to arrival and asked and was told it would be ok to order from kids menu and also that it does not have an age limit listed no where on the menu AND the fact that she took my order initially as if it was not an issue. She seemed to have no remorse and pretty made it aware that was no deviation from what she was told, which forced me in to ordering a larger meal portion. When food order was placed, the actual meals came within what seemed to be 7-10 minutes which was fantastic! The 2 food-runners were very welcoming and handled placing the food correctly to everyone.\n\nFood presentation was fantastic and it even tasted as good as it looked. The best thing about it all was everyone got hefty portion sizing. I was soo surprised with my ribs and ENORMOUS house salad. Having so much food but it not being heavy to make you have the feeling of over-eating\/stuffing yourself was the #1 consensus that everyone agreed they loved.\nNow after receiving our courses, the server didn't come back to the table until about 20 minutes afterwards and she legit just looked and then walked off without asking how everything was or if anything was needed. \nThe food was great,  great atmosphere, the server Cecelia on a scale of 1-10 would be rated a 3 as she seemed disinterested in ensuring that the table had a great experience, which is a key component, i.e: checking in on table, asking how everything is going, making suggestions, knowing the menu, offering solutions to problems that was caused by either her or the kitchen\/bar, etc...","stars":3.0}

She gave me all the information without being pushy. Many of the Lasik centers that I spoke with had a used car salesman feel to them. Price was different. Everyone that I came in contact with was very competent and professional. I had my surgery done with Dr. Price and it has turned out better than I ever expected. I was in shock at how well I could see even immediately after the surgery.  My only regret is that I didn't see Dr. Price for my post surgical follow up so that I could thank him in person.

After realizing that there was nothing that could be done to rectify the situation,  we relented to finish our meal and leave.  Even after asking for the situation to be dropped, the bartender harassed us at our table.  The manager them came and continued the confrontation.  After dropping $500 for 2 couples,  one would think a table could finish their meal as requested.  It was not our fault the bar staff changed shift and could not deliver the same quality as we started the night with.  \n\nA \"manager\" that can only respond with \"you are being very rude to me\" (even after asking him to drop it) needs to go back to high school and seriously consider another vocation.  \n\nNow a basic nuts and bolts point:\nIf the bathroom is disgusting (as this one was), leave.

It has a nice crunch on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. \n\nThe house salad is pretty awesome as well. I never thought I would like walnuts, apple pieces, Gorgonzola cheese, and craisins mixed in with lettuce and dressing. \n\nI highly recommend this place, it's well worth the money and leaves you wanting more because it was so good.

If you get a chemical treatment, a haircut will only set you back 8 more bucks versus the usual 10$.  Either way it's a steal.  My stylist\/student, Olivia, was very nice and did a nice job with the cut, color & style.\n\nSo, drawbacks were mentioned in the previous review.

We had a house call vet all lined up, just in case.  But-----when we called----we discovered this vet was out of town for a week!  Panic time.\n\nWe didn't want our dog to suffer. She was calm and not showing any signs of distress or pain, but she had had a small fit earlier in the morning.  It was time . . .\n\nWe couldn't even find another house call vet. We decided we would have to do what we had dreaded doing, which was to take our ailing dog to a vet clinic. How awful to put her through that, but what choice did we have? \n\nWe called all around, got a bunch of \"Are you presently a client?\" and \"Has your dog been here before?\"  We couldn't even get an appointment. It was a nightmare.\n\nI thought of Dr. Haskell and called him. His receptionist, \"Isa,\" was wonderfully kind and sweet. She told us to bring our dog in at 5PM.  We were SO RELIEVED.\n\nBut that was at 10AM.  Our dog, one of the best dogs in The Universe, devoted and awesome right up until the very end, didn't last past 11AM.

{"text":"Me giving them two stars is being generous. I came here a week ago with my boyfriend and his Indian grandparents. Like some of these reviews say we were greeted by the owner, sat down and that's when the customer service ended. We ordered the Samosas and vegetarian options, when the server asked us how spicy we said we like a little bit but not super spicy and he said so medium. We clarified that it wouldn't be too spicy and agreed to medium. The samosas came out and they were huge! However they were frozen cold in the center.  The peas were literally frozen in the center. It took us 10 mins to get our waiter and we resulted in walking up to the front to get him ourselves. When the waiter came to the table I explained it was frozen to which he PUT HIS FINGER IN MY SAMOSA. Now I understand he wanted to see if it was actually cold. But then he said, \"well that's not my fault, I don't cook them\". He walked away to go get who, I'm assuming was the owners wife. She took our plates and apologized multiple times. She brought us new samosas free of charge and for that I gave them two stars. However it gets worse. The \"medium\" spicy food we ordered was EXTREMELY spicy. My boyfriend and his grandparents are used to eating traditional spicy Indian food. The food was almost unbearable and his poor grandmother had to get more yogurt sauce because her mouth was on fire. We also had to ask for refills on water multiple times before we got any which took like 15 mins. Also, the garlic naan was semi-burnt when they brought it out. At that point we were done telling the staff our problems because clearly they didn't seem to care.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Thank you Peche. Most of my meals in NOLA were a bit underwhelming- it seems that many restaurants here are overhyped. This meal, however, was delicious, with just a few missteps. I was dining alone and sat at the bar, where the service was friendly and efficient. It was a bit cold because or the large windows, but this was in the middle of a cold snap that no venues I visited seemed prepared for. I ordered a Latin Quarter cocktail (essentially a rum-based Sazerac). I could have ordered a few more...yum. Then I had 6 oysters (from LA, MI, and one other state I think). They were divine, but I was unimpressed to find some shell bits in more than one of them. The cocktail sauce was incredibly sweet and lacking heat. Also, saltines? Why bother. Moving on, I love ceviche, and the one I had (cobia w citrus, olive oil, sunflower seeds) was divine. The celery leaves are what really tied it together. I wanted to drink the marinade left on my plate. I also had the legendary Brussels sprouts in chili vinegar, and yes, they are as delicious as everyone promises they are. To finish off the meal I had coffee and the salted caramel cake. I don't like super-sweet desserts so it was probably the wrong choice. It was delicious, but with heavy buttercream and a caramel sauce liberally drizzled overtop I found it a bit too much. Overall, despite the oyster-related issues, the small plates I had were so good that I left very satisfied, and would happily return to Peche.","stars":4.0}

It's extremely difficult to deal with on my own so I'm forced to go to salons very often for help just properly straightening it. I came in to Rain Salon asking for a botanical conditioning a blowout and a straightening, (of course). The conditioning and wash went well and the straightening was alright. The stylist worked quickly and I thought it was because of skill but I realized before long that she was in a hurry. My hair takes a bit longer, naturally. She probably had a client waiting, which she did. She didn't blow dry the hair all the way through because of her rush. Then the worst happened, I'd been needing a trim, so I said if we had the time to go ahead. She cut too much. It devastated me. The type of hair that I have, if you cut just. too. much. It gets puffy. All. The. Time. \n\nI asked for a refund at the end of service. I hadn't had a good look in a mirror at my hair until I'd gone to the bathroom. But a woman not working that day but happening to be there refused me immediately. She was quickly defensive and talked over me. I'm a meek person, I never argue. I felt like I was bullied. I left the salon that day in tears wishing I was a stronger person who could stand up for myself. I was unhappy with the cut they should have refunded period. But instead they turned aggressive. \n\nDo not go expecting a refund for a service you disliked. They will most likely refuse you with the retort, \"it was not done incorrectly.\" It doesn't matter if the service was unacceptable to you.

I also order a samosa because I love them.  I was not disappointed in any of the food.  The restaurant is cafeteria style.  You bus your own table (kind of how Panera bread used to be).

But if you're hoping to browse the poetry section or walk away with a stack of obscure graphic novels, you're better off going to the main branch.  \n\nDepending on who's working and whether or not the computers are behaving, be warned that some of the staff here can get be a little testy.  They do have about 7 public computers, which you have to sign up for on the designated reservations computer when you arrive.  The homework room is surprisingly large, about half the size of the main room, with big laminate tables for kids to do their work on.

{"text":"I'm convinced that there is no better place for a celebratory meal than Commander's Palace.  My most recent experience here was for my oldest daughter's 18th birthday.  I reserved a table at 7pm on a Friday night and let them know ahead of time that it was her birthday.  Upon arrival and telling them who we were, we were immediately escorted to a dining room on the 2nd floor.  We past at least 3 people who wished her a happy birthday.  How did they know?  Do they have ear pieces in like the secret service?\n\nShe was nervous and a little intimidated at first because it's very upscale and beautiful.   Thankfully, the staff is so good, they put her at ease right away with a few funny one liners and their down to earth personalities.  It amazes me how well they can read people.  There was a kind of pretentious older couple at the next table over and the water acted a certain way towards them and another way towards us.  For instance, I went to hand him my dish after my appetizer and he replied \" relax my man, it's our job to do the heavily lifting tonight\".  You cannot find better service anywhere.  Period.  \n\nOnward to the food.  The menu changes somewhat every day but there is always a few staples that don't change.  I ordered a Sazerac to start and it was the perfect bitter-sweet blend that you expect.  I stopped at 2 since I was with the munchkin.  We both had the turtle soups to start with the sherry and it was phenomenal as always.  Still surprised that my daughter ordered it and enjoyed it too.  For entrees, she got the filet mignon and I got the pecan crusted fish of the day which was I believe drum fish.  I originally was going to try a different fish but the waiter persuaded me to try the pecan crusted instead.  Always trust the waiter at a place like this.  The fish was phenomenal! It was lightly breaded in pecans with jumbo lump crabmeat and sitting in a corn sauce.  The daughter's filet was huge and you could cut it with a fork.  So tender. \nFor dessert she got the cr\u00e8me brulee which has a great presentation  with the Fleur De Lis.  They of course gave this to us for free for her bday.  \n\nI cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.  It's 5 stars in every category including value.  Thanks again for a meal that I will never forget.","stars":5.0}

John did extensive research for the rich history of Santa Barbara, showed pictures throughout the tour to aid in his spellbinding storytelling of the city, and provided personal insights as a native of SB. His passion for this volunteered work was apparent to see. In turn, everyone from the tour thoroughly enjoyed learning about the city and appreciating the beautiful history it offers. John also asked us for feedback at the end of the tour, which showed how much he cares about the quality of this tour and his willingness to be flexible in his preparation.

{"text":"We don't live very far away and have often admired the lineups outside (even on cold winter days) as people wait to get a seat. We thought, wow if people are willing to wait in the cold it must be impressive. We were not disappointed. We went on a Friday evening and thought we got there early enough but by 5:30 the place was already packed (always a good sign) but thankfully they were able to squeeze us in as the people ahead of us had a huge group of 8.\nWe started with drinks, I had a Bourbon (there selection is impressive) others in our group had cocktails (the Old Fashion was exceptionally good) There beer selection also looked extensive but we didn't get a chance to sample.  The menu is simple, you have your meats on the top left, sandwiches on the top right, side dishes on the bottom left and desserts in the bottom right. Since it was our first time we decided to go with the sample platter or small portions of every meat. For sides we had the coleslaw, macaroni and cheese and the baked beans. \nThe meat comes all piled on a big platter with the sides all around. It came fairly quick too. The meat was awesome. My favorites were the Fried Chicken, Beef Brisket and the sausage was pretty darn amazing too. They do there meats here very well...best in the city I'd say. Unlike other meat places in town where the meat is often very salty due to the brining process, the meat here is flavoured with smoke and I didn't find the need to drink excessive glasses of water. My absolute favourite side dish was the baked beans. It had tons of meat in it and was just full of flavour. Everyone at the table also liked the macaroni and cheese. The coleslaw was also good, better than most. \nFor dessert we tried the peach cobbler and even though we were quite full by then, it didn't disappoint either. Next time I want to try the chocolate bacon! \nOverall we really enjoyed ourselves. Yes it's loud but which high end restaurant in Edmonton isn't these days? You sit at big tables so there might be another couple or foursome beside you but there is enough room that you have privacy (plus it's nice to ask what your neighbour got) \nI love that it opened up on Whyte Ave and not downtown. I really want more restaurants like this to come to Whyte Ave. Downtown seems to get them all right now but this restaurant proves the Whyte Ave crowd will fill a restaurant to the brim. More restaurants and less bars will be welcome to the area.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I had been eyeing this place for a while and finally had the perfect opportunity to go in for dinner. It was about 8 or so and it was pretty slow inside we waited to be seated and we're seated near the bar. A waiter took our drink orders and then another waiter Chris took our dine in orders. He didn't mention any specials or ask if we had any questions about the menu. At the time I had not thought anything of this until another group was sat next to us and when Chris greeted them he read off all of the drink and dinner specials for that night. This was disappointing because the specials sounded really delicious and I probably would have ordered one of those. Our waiter just seemed very disinterested in us and more focused on the table next to us as they received excellent service. Service here I give 1 star. The food that we had ordered was delicious my friend had ordered the Mac and cheese and I had ordered the prime rib sliders with shoestring potatoes. Mac and cheese was cooked perfectly and great flavors. The sliders were great as well fries were nice and crispy. 2 stars overall because the food was undeniable I will return and hopefully be able to update my review","stars":2.0}

Drink\/Dine\/Dance\/Gamble\/Party\/Sleep all under one roof. No need to drive anywhere. \nThe casino part can still be a little smoky for my liking but most are. I'm amazed at the amount of people that still smoke, but then again I drink so judge thee not. \nI also like the sheer volume of options at this casino, just about any food type you want is here. \nI did check the oyster bar out and they are definitely on the upper end. I did better price wise downtown at Broadway.\nThe buffet also looks solid with a bonus chinese bar thrown in (everything included in buffet price except for the crab legs).\nTurns out I had not been to this casino in 14 years and they still had me in the system, now that's love. \nThe big win over the years for this casino has been the addition of all the new stuff on the south side of I70 which has made a quick casino exit a reality. You used to have to exit on the north side of I70. \nCan't wait to go back and try some more hot slots :-)","stars":4.0}

This sushi was better than I could have expected - we ordered 3 rolls, and the Philadelphia roll was the best out of any Philadelphia roll I've ever tried, and I eat a lot of sushi! Everything we ate, down to the wasabi on the side, tasted super fresh. We ordered goyoza to start which were were also great, something about them tastes different and I really enjoyed it.

Cost just over $9.00.  The veggies were fresh, the rolls outstanding, the meats delicious and each sub was made to perfection.  This clean and well-lit store was quite busy but the employees were hustling and smiling and getting the orders out fast, working well as a team.  I only saw one name tag, Ashley, so kudos to her and her partners at this Subway.  Granted, the plaza is dingy and run down with plenty of loiterers, but they won't bother you.

The chairs were efficiently packed two to a box, so they were on the bigger side, but definitely not anything out of the ordinary for Fedex to handle. When I arrived to the Fedex store the day after delivery, my chairs were nowhere to be found, but I was told to come back in a week to check if they were there.\n\nAfter online tracking showed the packages in Illinois three days later I called Fedex Customer Service and found out they had been refused upon delivery in Philadelphia by a store employee named Sheree Murphy, and that they were en route back to the sender in California. Long story short, I had to contact the vendor, have the items shipped out again, and I'm expecting delivery (to my apartment) on Friday - four full weeks after they originally shipped.\n\nMy biggest issues with this incident are that 1. no one called to let me know my packages wouldn't be at the store and 2. they had the packages returned to the sender instead of letting me pick them up at a different Fedex facility in town. If space is the problem (a cranky store associate said the manager turns packages away if they have a lot), then Fedex shouldn't offer to have packages delivered to this particular location. \n\nThis store clearly has issues - avoid avoid avoid.","stars":1.0}

I was new to the class, so he was able to give me the rundown without slowing down the rest of the class. He really paid attention to everyone and pointed out what we each could do to improve ourselves. After the session was over, I could barely walk up the stairs! LOL. NO PAIN NO GAIN! It was a great feeling getting in a nice workout after over a year and a half of not working out. He kept things interesting by doing different things.

This is basically a glorified fast food restaurant, at which you order at a counter, get a number and sit down, then your food is brought to you. When ordering, we were a little disappointed at the limited selection. I also was surprised when told they were out of sweet lassi -- I thought 'why not mix up some more?'. We took our number and sat down. When the food came, it was great -- really delicious. When my wife's mango lassi came, it was in a plastic cup with a sealed plastic film top that appeared to have Chinese writing on it. That solved the mystery of their running out of sweet lassi:  it appears the lassi are pre-made in a factory. Overall , the food was delicious, the modified fast food setup was disappointing (we'd prefer a real restaurant with waitstaff), and therefore the price a little high for this meal. We'll probably come back, but not as often as we would if it were a bonafide sit-down restaurant.

I dined here with a large group that ordered a bunch of different things so we all got to taste a bit of everything.\n\nI ordered the pulled chicken, ribs and chose mac n cheese and collard greens as sides. It was also served with cornbread. The pulled chicken was my favorite! It has just the right amount of smokiness and moisture for my taste. The ribs are good- but less smokey. So if that what you're looking for, I'd say they are heavier on the dry rub and not really saucey if that's what you're looking for. They are tender and cooked well.   \n\nCrowd favorites were the catfish, pulled chicken, fried okra and the sweet potato fries! The sweet potato fries are delicious! They're perfectly crispy with a light cinnamon sugar coating. They has more spice from the cinnamon than sugar, which is what I loved. They are a must try! Every table is set with paper towels, which will be put to good use! Food is served on trays, as BBQ should be! And is also served with a side of BBQ sauce, but they have other sauces on a condiment bar available as well. \n\nThe service is super friendly and the staff checked in with us several times throughout the evening.

She proceeded to what I assume was explain the menu, but talked so fast I was not able to follow along.  I placed my drink order (unsweet iced tea) and she looked blankly at me.

She stood at our table until I finally spoke up and said I had my order ready.  She then questioned me on everything on the form as though I was not capable of reading and filling it out.  My husband ordered a chicken ceasar salad.  We waited quite a while for our food.  When it arrived my husband commented that there wasn't even enough chicken for a chicken tender on his salad.

We waited for our server to come back so we could ask for our check.  When she did she very rudely asked if her manager had offer to remake \"it\" to which we said we had declined and asked for our check which she brought, took our payment then returned the receipt without another word.

{"text":"So the wife stops by next door to get her bloodwork done every so often and I've noticed this joint along with a location in the mall I saw not too long ago. Hit the gym and I have a cheat meal available, decided to make this the place to have it.\n\nOrdering is straight forward if you don't pay attention you will wind up ordering a double by default as you have to ask for a single. Stars indicate how many patties, topping are free along with choice of cheese, bacon, eggs or topped with chili is a buck more. Get a combo for $2.25 more gets you fries and a drink.\n\nGot the double combo ordered the pickle fries, comes with a buffalo sauce which seems to be a combo of mayo, horseradish and spicy mustard. Pickled fries are just that, thinly sliced pickles fried to a crunchy crisp, salty the first 15-20 are very good then it starts to add up. Burger was good, juicy, crisp edges, soggy but in a good way not some gooey mush sandwich. \n\nPrice was fair, I forked out $18 for two combos with add-ons.

{"text":"Zen Yai is the only Thai restaurant in SB suitable for a date. They have a rare late night menu on Friday or Saturdays which I've never tried but in a town where if you're hungry for a real meal at 10:30 or 11:00, you're SOL, this is noteworthy. \n\nThe Thai beef salad is about the best I've ever eaten. I MUCH prefer Thai to Chinese and as the years pass, I have less and less interest in Chinese food unless it's fine dining Chinese like Chin Chin in Manhattan (49th and 3rd across from legendary steakhouse Smith and Wollensky). I eat Thai probably once a week but my boyfriend and I don't come here as often as the local hole in the wall--though it's not much more expensive--because it's on State Street in downtown and parking can be a bit of a pain. \n\nThe food is outstanding and slightly more sophisticated--with quite a few appetizer and entree specials on the board each night--than Your Place (see my review) or Your Choice, in San Roque area of SB. I don't know why Thai restaurants are always visually disturbing but of the Thais in SB, this is the best-looking. Of course it's very dark so if it were as ghastly as either of the other popular Thai restaurants, one wouldn't notice! \n\nThe spicy beef noodles are a must and far less oily than the version at Your Place. \n\nI haven't been here in a year so do not remember the other entrees we usually order but this is a great place. They have okay wines by the glass but the corkage is probably low and the service is friendly and accommodating so I'm sure you could bring in a decent bottle of wine without being hassled too much.","stars":4.0}

I can't believe they are still around when there are SO MANY negative reviews on them. \n\nWhere do I start? Horrible and super slow support, very dishonest. Their business is not helping out beloved pets, their business is taking our money and then proceed to do ANYTHING they can to DENY ALL CLAIMS.  They will claim that EVERYTHING  is a pre-existing condition, even when  my veterinarian gave them evidence IN WRITNG that it wasn't. They don't care. They will keep giving you the run around and asking for endless documents until you get tired and give up....or , I guess give them the boot which is exactly what I have done today. There are countless pet insurance companies out there that do care about our pets and helping them. Pet's Best is in it for a quick cash grab. They probably deny 95% of their claims or something. But again, I am the one to blame for now doing more search on them. The numerous 1 star reviews on YELP should be enough evidence. STAY AWAY FROM THEM.\n\nAnd of course, in a few days you will see \"Ali\" from Pets Best reply to this comment in yet another sad attempt at controlling their online reputation. Here is a free tip: if you want great reviews, may be you should offer great service??\n\nAGAIN there is NO REASON to use Pet's Best AT ALL when there are hundreds of better pet insurance companies with WAY BETTER reviews than them.

She knew my name and was expecting me. It took literally 3 minutes to collect and pay. The pie was about $32 - which was a great price to pay for hoe good it tasted. It was a hit at the dinner party! The chocolate filling is smooth and light ( not too rich) and the cream is a good touch. While I was in the bakery I noticed so many beautiful pies, cakes and cookies in the display window.

I came here with my parents and we started with the Red Snapper Fish Tacos and the flavors on these were amazing! There was something that was a little spicy which might have been the Chipotle Sauce but again the flavors was a very nice combination. Now when we ordered our server told us several things that would be good picks off the menu and he insured that the chef gives very good proportions. When we got the Fish Tacos it came with 3 individual tacos but the quantity of the Snapper wasn't that much. I was definitely expecting larger chunks of Snapper due to the server consistently saying that the sizes of everything are extremely generous. Didn't really notice that but it was still worth it. For the main courses I split the Red Snapper Entree with my mom which came with brussel sprouts, slices of potato and I think it was some sort of couscous. It almost wasn't enough to split though. My dad had the Garden Grilled Cheese which was exceptional as well. The sauce on the Snapper though I still can't get over, it was cooked to perfection! It was so sweet and all the sides under the Snapper is really what made it. The serves was a little slow for how many people were there. We got there right before noon and it took a little over 25 min just for the appetizer to come out.

I couldn't understand what the woman was asking me when she held up the pumice stone so I just kept saying \"yes\".

The nice woman at the front desk asked me a few questions to see if I qualified for any discounts, but I didn't, so I had to pay the grand price of $5.  \n\nThe exhibits I saw were well worth the $5 admission. There was an \"Eastern\/Western\" exhibition which juxtaposed ancient Eastern art with similar pieces from modern Western artists. Then there was an abstract art gallery with pieces by famous artists such as Jasper Johns. The best part for me was a great blown-glass exhibit which showed pieces by the Northwest glass artist William Morris, and ended with a film showing a piece being blown by him from beginning to end -- and the piece shown in the film was in the gallery. Pretty cool! \n\nBeing from Seattle, I love SAM and I've seen lots of \"important\" exhibitions there, but it was really enjoyable to go to a smaller museum and spend just an hour or so, for a small admission price, to see some great works in a really lovely space. It's so easy to get to the Boise Art Museum, so why not give it a go?

In the middle of the night I wrote down four different Vets in Brentwood, hoping that someone could see us in the morning ACCB was beyond accommodating in getting me in right away. The receptionist is a very sweet woman who makes you feel like you're the most important person (and pet) in the world. The Vet kitty, Hercules, is hilarious... a bit slow, but docile and sweet. After moving from a pretty high tech Vet with all of the newest, latest facilities and equipment, I was a bit wary of the simplicity of the of the office. When I met Dr Sullivan, I immediately felt very comfortable. He was very down to earth, very knowledgeable and had a great bedside manner with my kitty. I had exceptional care at our last Vet, but many times I felt that I was being prescribed something for everything ... literally ... and I started to feel like they were draining me for everything I had. A product or medication for everything and I felt that (despite the excellent care we received), they were out to make money. I loved the simplicity of the ACCB office; the kind and gentle care of Dr. Sullivan and the straight forward advice and care that we received. Overall, I felt very good about my experience. The receptionist and Vet Tech were so kind and loving of my kitty and I felt that they, and Dr. Sullivan, had the best interest of my kitty at heart. Dr.Sullivan was very genuine and very knowledgeable. I have three other pets who I will most likely bring to ACCB when they need care.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Unimpressed by the service and underwhelmed by the food!!!! For starters our waitress Dominique all though we had her for about 10 mins was extremely unpleasant and just plain ignorant. We asked if they used latex glove because our friend has an extreme latex allergy and you could tell she never checked with the kitchen about it. She brought the waters and said nothing about if the used latex gloves or not then came back with drinks and asked for the food order. At this point we all looked and said what about the latex and you know what her response was we can work around any allergy. Uhhhhhh latex allergy is pretty hard to \"work around\" . About 20 Minutes later she comes back and was like I'm cut but Seth will be over to help you out. We get our  food and a eat about an half and hour and still never see or meet Seth. At this point extremely aggravated since we never had anyone check on us and keep seeing Dominique floating around the restaurant to the point where I had to ask the host where the hell our server was because we need to check out and don't want to ordeal this horrific service any longer. The only saving grace to this trip was the brisket prime dip! So yummy and would recommend but it's not worth the service we endured. The deviled eggs though had really gross after taste and would not recommend. Please post a photo of the too cool to greet server Seth, Im dying to actually meet him! I don't think I will ever be persuaded to come back if either server are there. Don't worry I will be happy to tell everyone that will listen about my worst costumer service experience I have ever had and that's tough to do because I understand everyone has bad days !!!!!!! If you do venture in there dispute the review request someone other then Dominique or Seth as your server so you can at least have a pleasant experience.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Not the best Thai I have had, but the lunch special paid off. I ordered the Cashew Nut and tasted some of the Red Curry. \n\nBoth were tasty, but I would recommend Red Curry(VEGAN) over the Cashew Nut (VEGAN) . However the Red Curry was ordered at Medium, and it had quite a kick to it. \n\nI recommend going during the lunch hours for the $7.99 special that includes miso soup (VEGAN) , salad, and a spring roll. I am not positive if the salad is made with vegan dressing or what the ingredients are in the spring roll, therefore I did not eat those. \n\nThe waitress was really friendly, however the service took slightly longer than expected. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a great cheap lunch special, I highly recommend trying out Thai Sushi House and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.","stars":3.0}

They have a few cats that live and hang out at the center, and I love seeing them when we come in. The staff is always super helpful and friendly, and pay attention to me as well as my kitty. \n\nI have a rambunctious Tortoise Shell who doesn't always act on her best behavior. The first time we took her to see the doctor, she gave him quite the scratch up the arm. It was bleeding and everything!! It was so embarrassing. He was totally cool about it, and started telling me why Tortoise shell cats act the way they do, and he even gave me some tips to help with her crazy behavior. They got out the big leather gloves, and were so sweet to her, even though she wanted to claw their brains out. \nOnce they have examined her, they are happy to let the kitty roam around the room as they would like, which causes much less stress (at least for my kitty). \n\nOther vets I have been to over the years always try to get you to buy food\/meds\/etc. from their office at a much higher price, but he really does try to be honest with his clients and give them as much information about prices, and places to buy the items for their specific needs.

My first visit was on a Sunday afternoon, and I took that opportunity to sample a few hoppy-but-not-too-high-on-alcohol varieties recommended by our server. The follow-up experience took place on Tuesday evening, and at that time I opted for a regular sixteen-ounce pour of \"New Beginnings,\" a clean and tasty American pale ale. I liked all the beers I tasted over the course of my two visits, though I can't say any stand out in particular, and I already can't remember the cutesy names of any others besides the New Beginnings. I'm curious to try some of their higher-alcohol offerings but plan to save those for an occasion on which I am not driving.\n\nService is extremely friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed, just as a brewery should be. Although Sunday afternoon brought in at least a few cyclists off the very nearby Schuylkill River Trail, I was surprised to find that the brewery was much more crowded on Tuesday. I'm not sure this is attributable to any particular craving for craft beer that the Phoenixville crowd develops on Tuesdays so much as the fact that neither Bluebird Distilling nor Crowded Castle are open then. (Your move, future Conshohocken Brewing outpost.) I haven't tried any food yet, but the tacos are high on my list, thanks largely to other Yelp reviews and my nosy staring as servers passed by our table with various plates for other patrons. (Incidentally, the food menu may be reason to choose Root Down over Crowded Castle for any outing calling for that.)\n\nAll in all, a solid addition to Phoenixville's ever-expanding craft brew scene.

For the most part, I've been here only when I didn't live in the Philly area, and largely with tourists from overseas.\n\nIt's a fun space to visit, especially for those familiar with the movie, and was pretty cool when the statue was at the top of the steps.

{"text":"This place was great, especially for a hotel restaurant! I was across the street at the convention center for a conference and needed lunch every day, so we checked this place out, which is inside the Omni. \n\nDay 1 - You are given freshly made hot biscuits with homemade jams to start. My colleague is gluten free and they had those for her as well. She said they were light and flaky and delicios. I ordered this vegetarian, vegan, gluten free dish, but added salmon as a protein. The dish, which I cannot remember the name (sorry!) had rice, some sort of pea similar to a blackeyed pea, and root veggies. It came with a trio ot sauces - a homemade vinegar-based hot sauce (fantastic!), chow chow (which is kind of like like pickled banana peppers and is also fantastic), and a seed butter (which was also fantastic). Mixing these add-ons into the dish made it over the top delicious. The salmon was cooked perfectly. it even had the skin left on, which I'd normally gag at, but it was super crispy and actually quite good. \n\nDay 2 - I wanted that same dish again and my coworker wanted it too, so we came back. This time I didn't add a protein as I got a side of deviled eggs instead. It was still equally as good. My coworkers loved it and ate every bite. The deviled eggs were fantastic. The GF biscuit served to my colleague was hard as a rock so they made her fresh ones. It took 20 minutes but they were fresh out of the oven!\n\nDefinitely check this place out if over by the convention center or staying at the Omni - you won't be sorry!","stars":5.0}

It was killer. I think it was $7 for that. Compare that to the more pretentious restaurants I have eaten at, especially in Santa Fe, NM and this is a steal for this kind of dish. \n\nI also ordered fried calamari which was amazing and I had a fried potato dish comped. It was all unbelievable. \n\nThe wine actually blew me away for $7.50 a glass. I couldn't believe that you could get such good wine for that price. Most restaurants in Santa Fe that serve decent wine charge about $14 for a glass as good as this. Obviously the sommelier knows what's up because this was basically the house Malbec. \n\nOverall, a great value!! If you consider this place expensive...please stick to Mickey D's, Kentucky and Panda. Ok?","stars":5.0}
{"text":"New to the NOLA, I ordered in from the Holiday Inn Downtown-Superdome. I ordered the southern chicken sandwich (with pretzel bun), with sides of fries and Mac-n-cheese. The delivery was super quick, I don't even think a full 30mins past before I was called down to get my food. So 5-stars for speedy delivery, however my Mac-n-cheese has spilled in the bag, so all of my food was soggy, causing my experience to be a tad bit unfortunate (so I have to knock the rating down just a bit for presentation).\n\nHowever, the food tastes AMAZING! The Mac-n-cheese sauce is more like a creamy thick gravy, from the little I actually tasted, it was so good! The chicken sandwich was so tasteful, down to the sweet tasting pickles on it. Good selection of the pretzel bun! The fries were regular tasting, nit really any special seasoning but they were fries none-the-less. \n\nOverall, it was a great start to the taste of the NOLA baby!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Sorry, work has kept me busy.... \n3.5 stars.  \n\nSuburban white people are weird.  I don't understand why this place is rated so high as the Best Chinese Restaurant in America.  These rankings, just like US News reports, have a good amount of politics.  This restaurant looks like an early 90s Holiday Inn Lounge with overpriced Chinese food that I can get in Chinatown for half the price any day.  Clearly, this is a place for people who never had 'real' Chinese food. \n\nI had their Chef's Surprise meal.  Decent deal for their overpriced menu.  $36 per person, 2 person minimum\n\nStarter:  \n\nAppetizer sampler of Veggie Spring Roll, Coconut Shrimp and Meat Wonton.  Coconut Shrimp was pan seared which was (slightly) different and served with extremely potent horseradish dipping sauce.  Others were pretty standard.\n\nIt came with an asian pear salad which was very good.  (So simple!  Asian Pear, olive oil, rice wine vinegar, salt, microgreens)   haha... these chefs are gonna hunt me down for giving away their secrets.  I can't help that I have a good palate.\n\nSoup: Standard Seafood soup with corn. \n\nDinner:  \n(2 entrees!\nFilet Mignon with Basil Sauce\nThe star of the night.  Delicious!! I wish they didn't kill the meat, though, it was slightly tough, which is a shame.  Would have liked it medium rare. \n\nSoft Shell Crab, Hong Kong Style\nserved with garlic noodles. \nCrab was good.. breaded and deepfried with seasalt and cracked black pepper (how could it not be?).  Noodles were overdone.  \n\nDessert:\n\nAWESOME!\neach person received 3 mini desserts:  Chocolate hazelnut cake, which was my favorite,  Lemon mousse tart, and Tiramisu. My friend and I took it to go because we were too full at this point.\n\nYou get a Dark chocolate fortune-cookie to end the meal. \n\nSo, overall the place has pretty solid food with a some added flair that Americans like.  Not the best Chinese food meal I've ever eaten in my life.  But I guess if I were so limited as to think that Chinese food was just MSG ridden Deep Fried Mystery Meat with that ubiquitous Red Sauce, I would think it was the best, too.","stars":3.0}

I want to give it a 3\/5 but the follow up of our experience makes me put a 4\/5. \n\nI came here with some friends and my friend ordered the steak and asked for there to be no pink, so well done. \n\nWhen the steak arrived and she began to eat it, there was a little blood coming out on her plate and into her mash potatoes. She felt really bad to say something but I didn't want to her to not enjoy her meal. \n\nWe asked our waitress for a steak that was well done because the first one that came out was still red on the inside. It took a long time until my friend got her second steak, the waitress told us it usually takes longer because they have to make sure the steak is cooked all the way, understandable.\n\nBut when my friend got her steak the second time it was even more red than the first time!! I was shocked and surprised that a cook 1. Didn't know how to cook a well done steak 2. Didn't at least check that the steak was well done. \n\nMy friend ended up getting the chicken parm and was very satisfied with her meal. \n\nThe manager followed up with us and offered everyone at our table a free dessert. \n\nI would just recommend that if you like your steak well done maybe don't come here.","stars":4.0}

Next I got a the potato soup,  but they forgot to add the bacon and cheese to it, so brought out those sides 10mins later when I was done with it.      I got the rib eye sandwich and baked potato as a side,  the meat was very cheap in it and the sandwich expensive.  The backed potato was tiny and overcooked,  not sure how they found one this small.         For this price I had much higher expectations.

We decided to share a dry aged bone in rib eye, my favorite steak, with horseradish mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus as sides. The asparagus was delicious but the potatoes were dry not at all creamy. But the real disappointment was the steak.

We told him how tough the steak was and he started giving a bunch of excuses instead of offering to get us something else, He did tell the manager who finally came over to talk to us, also making excuses and did offer to take half off the price of the steak and take of the mashed potatoes, She even offered us a free dessert, I declined the free dessert but my lady friend took a slice of cheese cake to go. I let her take the steak home to her dog. I hope he can chew that meat that cost me $29.50 at half price. Bottom line, NOT what I would call a FIVE STAR steakhouse.

Very disappointed with quality we went to the lounge side to start we ordered drinks that were not very good. We ordered a mojito that tasted like lemon juice with some mint leaves also a recommended drink that was not on the menu that was vodka based with raspberries, not sure what it was suppose to taste like but it burned on the way down.

She prescribed antibiotics and told me to pick up an acne creme for him.\n\nI was shocked when I was sitting at home reading the bill and I found out that the antibiotics cost me almost $80!

{"text":"This is the first time I had been to this suburban family-friendly staple. I can finally understand why everyone loves the breadsticks and endless salad. I also understand why people stop going after they grow up. One shouldn't venture into Olive Garden thinking they will be eating authentic Italian fare. However, it's quite yummy in its own right. I ordered the Pappardelle Pescatore, which is seafood on a bed of really fat noodles, tossed with a creamy tomato sauce. Shrimps were crisp and juicy, clams weren't fishy, and scallops were only so-so. The sauce was great though.\nThe boyfriend ordered the steak gorgonzola alfredo. Steak and pasta, not really a great combination. Even though he ordered medium, the steak that he received was definitely medium-well, borderline well-done. Quite unfortunate.\n\nThe ambience was nice, though a bit noisy. Servers were great.

Tell me again what you were saying while we were waiting to put our order in.\n\nRan: I said \"This place is a Catch-22. You don't want to come here when you're hungry because the service is so slow. But you have to be pretty hungry to enjoy the food.\"\n\nNic: That's right, that's what you said. The food was pretty bad. And the service was terribly slow. That poor lady. And poor us. \n\nRan: Yeah, no kidding. You had square chicken. I've never seen square chicken before! Was it boiled in a bag? I noticed you took a picture. \n\nNic: It was even worse. I think they portioned out cooked curry chicken meat in baggies and froze them. You know how chicken oozes that white goop when you cook it after it's been frozen? That's protein, that is. When I ordered the Peanut Chicken, they must have just pulled one from the freezer, thawed it in the microwave (correction per the owner, it's not microwaved but wrapped in foil and deep-fried)  and put it on the plate. The meat was covered in protein goop. They did not even bother to loosen up the chunks of meat, it was just one flat, square chicken patty on top of a tasteless, soggy carrot-cauliflower-broccoli combo, next to the chilled white rice. \n\nRan: Yum - not. I noticed your peanut sauce was basically cold, runny peanut butter. \n\nNic: *sigh* Yup. Hey, let's talk about what you had! \n\nRan: I had the Beef Filet with onions and potatoes. I thought it was edible. The beef was tender, and lucky for me, I like garlic more than most people, There was a lot of garlic! \n\nNic: Yup. Lots of garlic. And a crunchy rice ball. That was good, if you like cream cheese. And you also had chilled white rice. What's up with that? Cold rice? It was not even cold as in room temp, it was cold as in cold-cold. \n\nRan: The cha gio was from the freezer too. I think I saw them (clarification - the cha gio, not the owners of the restaurant) earlier today at the Asian store: twenty for five bucks. I kid you not. But besides that, what did you think about the service? That poor lady is severely understaffed. A good thing we weren't in a hurry!\n\nNic: I saw two couples walking out before they could even order. I wonder if she's the waitress AND kitchen staff in one? That would explain the cold food, the frozen chicken and the loooooooooooooooong wait time. \n\nRan: I think those couples had it right. Next time we go, let's get up and leave before we order, too!\n\nNic: What do you mean, \"next time\"??\n\nRan: Good point.","stars":1.0}

It's in an ugly, small strip mall on Kings Hwy... very busy, congested area. Also the parking lot is tiny, with about 2 spots allotted per store. Secondly, the salon itself is tiny. They do have a great polish selection and their prices were clearly displayed- a plus. Also, the man who greeted us was polite- another plus. \n\nThe manicure was ok, the hand massage was way too fast, but the polish did dry quickly and evenly. Another con, the biggest of all to me- there is one older t.v. hung on the side wall with a broken screen.

The batter on the fish and chips was exceptional, but the star of the dish was the fries. Perfectly crisped, well seasoned, cut to the size that I prefer (I don't favor the thicker, steak-cut fries). \n\nFor desert we all had the creme brulee.

It's quiet and easy to get around though flooded today during our visit so make sure to wear close toed shoes if rain is in the forecast! \n\nWhile no map is offered for the more famous crypts you can walk around and look for them while discovering some beautiful ones and some ~200+ years old! It's very interesting to read the names of 20-30 people all buried in the same crypt and you can contemplate how they all fit in there. \n\nThis cemetery is about 4 blocks from Magazine Street and also from St Charles.

{"text":"Even though I had never heard of a snowball before today, I found this little gem and the yelp reviews twisted my arm into trying it. For those not from this area, snowballs are basically snow cones that are made up of so much deliciousness that they had to rename them. \n\nIf you have been to Tucson, Arizona and are as passionately in love with Eegees as I am, snowballs are right up the same alley... except that these sneaky bastards upped the ante by giving you the option of plopping cheesecake in the center of your tantalizing ice treat. That's 2 things that get me all hot and bothered thrown into one small cup. \n\nThe only thing distracting me from my oral love affair was the fact that while I ate it I had to suffer through watching Nickelodeon on the TV which made me feel slightly uncomfortable. No grown man should be made to watch that crap while eating a snowball. People were reading into my moaning as something completely inappropriate... but you go and see if you don't do the same.\n\nAt the recommendation of the girl at the counter I tried the Red Velvet with a plop of cheesecake. It tasted exactly like a red velvet cupcake. It was a beautiful thing. \n\nSo, I can do nothing but stand and clap my hands slowly for Sno-La. Thank you for introducing me to snowballs. We shall meet again.","stars":5.0}

I brought the car back to them on 4 different occasions and they claimed to fix it. But now that im just outside their 90 day window (my life has been pretty busy with a new baby and 3 other kids) i finally took the car into a shop thats owned by a family friend because the issues have never been resolved. They just told me that the cars engine is shot and it needs a new engine which will cost me more than the car is even worth. So i called the dealership to work something out since they were so \"nice\" before and they just said \"well you bought the car as is so theres your answer\" i told them i was going to take them to small claims court and they said \"look forward to it, i go everyday\" DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.

We had arrangments at 4:30pm on Thursday and she replied to my email to confirm that date and time. I even sent her links to some dresses that I liked, so she could get an idea of what it was that I was looking for. I showed up about 10 mins early (this is my first time shopping for gowns so I wanted to browse a bit before my apt). I was greeted by the woman sitting at the computer and she looked a bit confused that I was there..... I told her that my name was Amber and that I had a 4:30 apt to try on gowns. She said, \"ohh okay, she's (another bridal consultant) with another guest at the moment let me go speak to her for one second\"! Not an issue at all, I continued to browse the gowns to the right of the computer. The woman who greeted me came back with another woman and I explained that I had an apt at 4:30 to try on gowns. Both gals did seem to really know about the fact that I was coming in? Awkward.... Anyway, the gal that originally greeted me ended up helping me, since the other woman was busy. She, unfortunately, was nice but didn't seem very excited, or very helpful? I told her that I wanted to stay in a budget under $(X amount) and then she took me over to a small selection of dresses to look through. I understand that the selection is not her issue but I just felt that overall the experience was a bit unprofessional and honestly...not very exciting. I supposed I thought It was going to be more of an enjoyable experience. Since I did not see anything that I really liked, I ended up leaving.","stars":2.0}

Also loved the wine and how expansive the selection was - you can absolutely find anything you'd want there. The atmosphere was terrific as well and very laid back and relaxing, especially considering it is in such a heavy foot traffic area by the mall. \n\nHighly recommend this spot if you're looking for a mellow evening out with friends or your significant other.

You don't have to compromise here if someone wants Chinese and you're in the mood for sushi--they have it all.\n\nThe restaurant itself was really nice and clean and has a great style.  Service was great, but we went before traditional rush hours.  They have a full bar and a really nice selection of drinks and their happy hour menu is pretty varied (not just cheap house wine and 2-for-1 domestics).  \n\nThe food itself was phenomenal.  I'm not a foodie and can appreciate good food when it's put in front of me.  I don't know if my Drunken Noodles were prepared using organic veggies by an Asian immigrant, and I don't care because they were some of the best noodles I've had.

The sides were the vegetables of the day and the lentil soup which both were good, nice flavor. The sandwiches we weren't really feeling until later on that night so they were way better cold\/room temperature rather than hot. I also had a lemon raspberry cupcake which I thought tasted really great. The food was good but not spectacular. I could have spent $30 at the grocery store and made the same meals at my house really. I like going to a vegan restaurant and being wowed. Which sadly we just weren't super wowed. But nonetheless it was still great food. The only thing we didn't like was, and no judgment on how anyone lives their life, the staff were very hippie which is cool with me, but our waitress was wearing a sleeveless cut off and her armpit hair was very long and it was a little unappetizing. Which maybe is why we didn't enjoy the food as much. Girl guy I don't care who you are, I don't want to see anyones armpit while I'm about to eat you know. Also a very long wait because there is only a finite amount of tables and really overly crowded. \nSo overall not bad food just the atmosphere and smallness was really the issue.","stars":3.0}

It's enormous in there, and most of that real estate serves to accommodate a snaking line of seafood-seeking patrons. It's worth the wait. Your reward is a pile of seafood for the price of a fast-food meal, and sixty-seven times as tasty. Maybe more.\n\nEverything on the menu is magical. Get a sack of boiled crawfish and some deep fried crab or shrimp. There are a bunch of soups and boiled sides, like corn on the cob, that you should nab also.

There was a wait when we arrived, but we just waited outside in the shade (while baby finished napping), and then we perused the gifts inside.  The wait was less than 20 minutes, so we were quite pleased about that.\n\nHubs got the chorizo scramble with tortillas and I got a chicken, green chile, and swiss omelette with cinnamon raisin toast.  They let me add avocado and get the omelette with just egg whites without batting an eye, so I appreciated that.  We also got coffee.\n\nThe coffee was really good!

They dont use he modified meat(im not saying the modified ones taste bad) like the majority of other cheesesteak places so as you eat you can taste and feel the difference in texture. Even their bread was fresh! My friend had the angus burger and when I had a bite it was so juicy and had so mich flavor!(writing this review is making me want to go there again) Staffs are nice and although I havent tried their buffet, they looked fresh and had a lot of variety. I also like how they have the see through covers for the food.\n\nI read the other commenter saying they have a chinese buffet and because of that this place cant possibly have ab authentic cheese steak, this actually upsets me as a person who has been to this place, and know for a fact that this is actually as authentic as it gets.

{"text":"Was there yesterday with a friend. Yelp reviews were high with a ton of reviews so we gave it a shot. Very touristy vibe if you're into that. I'm not personally. The waitress came and she was excellent. Told us that she had tried all the food on the menu over a long period of time and gave us recommendations. Later after we had a yelp coupon she told us that she had only been there a couple of weeks...Regardless it's all about the food right? I had Cajun pasta with chicken but I added crawfish tails. It was ok. Like something I could get at Applebee's back home. The flash fried tails were meh. Not bad just unremarkable. I recommend other options before going here.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I cannot stress enough how unreliable this service is. If you have no immediate plans and have a flexible schedule this airline is fine. The pilots are fantastic and fun... the ground crews seem competent. Having utilized this service for five flight now, every flight was delayed one or more hours. One was weather-related, so I can deal with that. What I can't excuse is technical problems with desk workers absent while passengers wait anxiously at a gate for an hour before finally calling customer service and having the operators track anyone down at an international airport. I cannot excuse being stranded in the middle of Iowa between destinations with no available flights for two days and needing to make separate ground travel arrangements at incredible cost to myself. I cannot excuse the utter lack of accommodation in this situation. Vouchers are worthless.\n\nFive stars if you don't mind riding the clouded airways of scheduling uncertainty with two great pilots. Zero stars for hours wasted and making dual-mode transportation plans.","stars":1.0}

The dress was ruined.  After questioning the owner about the condition of the dress, the owner said, she was not liable and she would only compensate her for $8.50 which was the cleaning. She also said, she can not be held liable bc all she did was clean it and this would have happened at any other cleaner.  This is not a fair business practice.  My daughter is a college student, working her way through college on minimum wage.  She saved her money to buy this dress and she only wore it once.  I believe the owner should take responsibility for her companies error and should agree to fairly compensate my daughter.  I will never do business their again.

Inside is a bit small, but it's not intended for people to have prolonged dining. You can go for a quick bite before a movie or afterwards. I like the teriyaki chicken.

This place is the best combination of tea quality, menu variety, creative drinks, cute packaging, and beautiful atmosphere! \n\nI got the mochi matcha. I've been dying to try a boba drink with mochi, which has been so hard to hunt down and are usually in a very few trendy boba shops.  It was a matcha milk tea with cheese foam, red bean, and mochi paste. Note that the mochi aspect of the drink is a liquid paste rather than a chewy ball that you typically think of when you hear mochi. I personally loved it but it may not be for anyone. \n\nThey only had one sweetness setting for this particular drink which I think was perfect. \n\nThe shop was beautifully decorated, had ample seating space, had free Wi-Fi, and is a great space to study. \n\nNot to mention the bear cup the drinks come in are so cute!!

And I'm not one to complain about prices, but you have to be freaking kidding me on this.\n\nMy husband and I have been loyal customers since day one.  We would routinely order the same order- tofu pad thai, tofu drunken noodles, and crispy tofu and it would be about $22-23.   On my most recent delivery order for myself, I ordered the tofu drunken noodles and crispy tofu and that alone was over $20??  Wtf!\n\nFirst of all, the noodle dish has jumped from $9 to $12 in the last year or so.  I know the economy is bad, but seriously?  A 30% increase?  The crispy tofu (which I have to say isn't so good now that massively deep fry it) is $5, which is two bucks more than before.  Really, did the price of tofu really go up 70% in the last year?  Give me a break...  \n\nAnd to add insult to injury, although I'm a few short blocks away, they charged me a $2 zone fee.  The website clearly says free delivery with orders over $15.  So what gives?  I feel bad but I gave the guy exact change and told him that its because they obviously charged me a delivery fee when it is not posted on their website.   Oh and the price they charged me for my dish ($12) does not match what it says on the menu ($10 +$1 for the tofu).  It may only be a buck, but it just lost Circles a customer.\n\nOK rant over.

The kind feller working the counter overhead my thought process and suggested I sample them. He jokingly mixed up the flavors on me to trick my brain, and boy-o-boy was I wrong. The egg custard was the sweetest thing and when mixed with secret creamy sauce and ice it created a consistency that far exceeded any plain old sno cone I've ever had.

That's what makes Fuji a bit of an oasis in this desert of shopping centers and T.G.I. Fridays. \n\nFuji is one of those steakhouses where you can see your chef toss your meat and vegetables about right before your eyes, but I always opt for the sushi over elaborately prepared and exhaustively flipped and chopped entrees.  They have a few sushi combos that are pretty great and hover around $8 including soup and salad--and the salads come with a delicious ginger sauce that I can't seem to find anywhere else.\n\nFuji also offers a combo that I believe is called the \"Lunchbox\" combo.  It comes with vegetable tempura as well as several types of sushi and seafood.  The portions are enormous, and that meal is also under $10.  The staff is always quick and helpful, and despite the cuisine being pretty varied and complex, your food is always ready in a jiffy.\n\nFuji is in a sort of unassuming little building, and from the outside it honestly doesn't look very appealing.  However, their sushi is perfectly acceptable (though not as exemplary as many places in Nashville proper).  If you live in Goodlettsville or just happen to find yourself there, this is certainly your best (if not only) option for some delicious Japanese cuisine.","stars":4.0}

If you know I only am allowed generic medicines on my insurance, but you turn around and prescirbe me something name brand it's not covered yes i have to call to let you know. \n You go into the medical field to help patients not to be rude when they have questions, if you feel that it's disturbing you, then you should probably find a new occupation. People are going to call with questions, and \"if we've been over this before and it's always repeating\" says an assistant, which I will leave namless.

I love that there's a community workout sort of feel, but that you still get the one-on-one attention from a personal trainer. My trainer Kerwin is great! His workouts are specially tailored to my training goals and always include a mix of things so that I always leave feeling like I got a full body workout.

I had a pocket full of money and barely spent any, cause they just walked by.\n\nOther reason I did not give 5 stars, is because the drinks are way over priced. $7 for a Corona, $6 for a Bud light, $5 for a bottle of water is ridiculous. And most of the shot or mixed drinks were like $10 or higher. Don't think I have ever payed prices for drinks like that before at the other clubs I have been to. \n\nDid like the free shuttle service.

{"text":"I really hate to write this review. However, I think that it is worth noting. Please be advised that the one star rating is simply based on the fact that this dealership had a pretty decent inventory. Recently, I toyed with the idea of updating my current Lexus for a newer model. I figured this would be an early graduation gift to myself. While researching various luxury dealerships in the area, I was immediately drawn to a model that was listed online through Mungenast Lexus. I'd never been to this particular dealership before but was confident in the possibility of finding exactly what I was looking for price and model wise. Immediately after finding a vehicle of interest, I provided some basic information online stating that I would like to stop by for a test drive. After a few hours of not receiving a response, I decided to drive to the dealership. No big deal! I was out shopping, the weather was nice and I figured I'd add this to my list of errands for the day. Once I arrived to the dealership I parked right in front of the building and proceeded to locate the vehicle that I'd seen online. After locating the vehicle I was surprised to see that the doors were unlocked. Upon opening the door there was a manual along with other information about the vehicle. My mom and I opened the trunk, hood, sat in the back seat.... we did everything that one typically does when car shopping. Since there were numerous models to choose from (this is why I chose this dealership), we looked at other models and compared pricing, mileage, differences within the body types, etc. Keep in mind that this was a Saturday afternoon. There were others on the lot browsing and being courted by sales staff. After about 40-45 minutes my mom and I noticed that no one ever came out to ask if we needed help. Now! I'm not sure of the policies at Mungenast and I understand that no one wants to be haggled by an overbearing car salesman trying to gain his\/her monthly quota. It's one thing to be hassled by sales but to not be acknowledged at all was completely and totally unacceptable. I can guarantee you that if it were up to my mother, we would have left the lot in a 2016 Lexus but I REFUSED to go out of my way to find someone to assist ME when I was about to spend $32k! I suppose someone eventually saw my online request for a test drive and they reached out to me the following Monday. I explained to the gentleman what we experienced and he didn't seem too concerned. Lastly, I'm not trying to drag the Mungenast name through the mud but I will say that I expected better service.  I won't say that I'll never go back because as the old saying goes, \"Never say never!\"  For now... my search continues!","stars":1.0}

I told him they can have it, no need for change....well, he walked away so I left the black book on the table while I talked with the other customers, later our original server came back and took the book, then, very loudly and with an attitude, she asked me \"was my service not to your licking?\" I said \"what?\" She said \"you did not tip me right\"....there was $5 dollars in the book.  I know we left her 15 dollar tip because our bill was $84 and we gave her $100....that's not our fault that someone else came and got our bill and took it to cash is out, she should have been paying attention.SHE WAS  A RUDE server  and you never ask for more money, EVER. Specially in front of other customers. I was a server for 5 year, I would never not tip a server the proper amount of money for the bill, we know that if you don't have the money to tip, you don't go out to eat. This place needs to train their staff of proper etiquette, and ALSO, I believe that the  other server stole her tip and she needs to question him.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"My carnivore friends and I needed to find a place that we all liked. This restaurant was our newest 'mutual like' discovery. \n\nThe restaurant is beautiful decorated. They have Buddha statues, a center island with lanterns, dragons, and fortune cookies. The tables are always clean. The waitresses are always friendly. \n\nI normally order their Salt & Pepper Tofu. It is my favorite dish. The vegetables are always fresh, cooked perfectly. They have Sriracha on the tables. \n\nTheir flour-less chocolate cake is to die for! It's the best in town. \n\nTaking a star off, because I often tell them I want the Tofu cooked longer and they bring out soft tofu. Or I order a dish that list Jalapenos as a item in the dish and the omit the Jalapenos.  While they correct the error, it does get annoying that they always make the same mistakes.\n\nThey have many vegan \/ vegetarian dishes.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I had a horrible customer service experience here today and would never recommend this location to anyone.  While multiple employees were at the entrance ready to help, they all treated me disrespectfully.  The 2 younger women at the door answered my question about which TV carriers AT&T was now associated with while stifling a laugh.  When I asked if they happened to know where I could get a replacement remote for my current system, they laughed at me and said \"No, but we can sign you up for DirectTV.\"  None of the 3 employees at the door looked genuinely interested in helping me and treating me with respect.  The interaction had the feel of talking to 2 overgrown high school bullies (the 3rd employee just stood there silently listening and didn't do anything).  Although I would have been willing to discuss more reliable TV service options with them, I'm definitely not going to speak to someone for any reason who treats me disrespectfully.  I will take my business to a provider who is genuinely interested in helping me and providing me with good service.  It's too bad it didn't end up being AT&T\/DirecTV.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I spent my high school years living in a motor home park in Boca Raton, FL., so when my friends suggested brunch at Boca after our church outing, the thought of dining at a restaurant named after one of my hometowns greatly appealed to me. Boca had no problem accommodating our party of 10, but we did call ahead for a reservation which I recommend doing as Boca is quite popular for brunch. All that singing in church gets me parched, so I immediately ordered a Bloody Mary and I must say, it was one of the best Bloody Mary's I have ever chugged. Being the carb lovers that we are, we ordered the breakfast breads and jams which arrived on a wooden platter. There were two different types of bread varieties accompanied by various fresh, homemade jams as well as homemade peanut butter. Quite delish. I was not in the mood to be healthy, so for my main dish I opted for the OMG prime house burger....OMG indeed. It was cooked to a medium rare perfection and definitely ranks as one of the best burgers, if not the best burger, I have ever inhaled. The fries that accompanied it on the side were also quite delicious as they were fried in duck fat. Quack. \n\nAside from the delicious food and drinks, Boca also has adorable, miniature utensils, bowls, etc. One of my friends designs and builds dollhouses for a living, so she is naturally obsessed with all things miniature, including people. She was a huge fan of these items, and our server was gracious enough to inform her of where she can purchase them. Fueling an unnatural obsession? Maybe. Going above and beyond to be helpful to a customer? Definitely. I will for sure be returning to this establishment and cannot wait to one day try it out for DINNER.","stars":4.0}

They also reassured me that they would not sell a duplicate dress to anyone that attended the same prom, that purchased from their store.\n\n From the beginning till the end, my daughter and I just had an amazing experience and we just felt extremely good about purchasing from Jan's...

I would recommend the queso fundido with chorizo and the croquetas de jamon, both are very good.  However, the guacamole is very hit or miss, and in my mind after the experience I had with it last night, not worth the gamble.  Although it is prepared table side, the quality of the avocados varies dramatically and the servers do not seem to know the difference.  The guacamole is very bland, and they ask you if you want pico de gallo on the side, which with most guacamoles is usually mixed in already, however here they charge you an extra $5.  \n\nI will say that the sangrias are very good.

Happy Tails could have also told us what terminal to go to, in Germany, to retrieve our dogs.  They didn't so we didn't know where to go to get our dogs, and didn't know where they were which was frightening.  Also, the crate\/kennel that they handmade for us, which was pricey, was not wide enough for our dog.  She could not stretch her legs entirely width-wise, and she's a Greyhound and needs to stretch a lot to be comfortable.

{"text":"OK, finally, a Japanese restaurant that does things right.\n\nMy usual disclaimer for Asian restaurants: I'm third generation Japanese\/Korean, grew up with great Asian cooking by parents born in Hawaii, can cook Japanese food better than most Tucson Japanese restaurants, and lived in Japan for two years.\n\nFinally got a weekend opportunity to check out Ikkyu's ramen so I took my wife and my daughter and ordered each of us a tonkotsu ramen and an order of yakiniku in a bowl. Excellent ramen! Good broth, fresh ingredients, and a generous portion. Both my wife and daughter could not finish theirs, which was a bonus for me as clean up in the batting order.\n\nThe noodles are cooked just right and have the right consistency. The pork is fresh and lean and sliced consistently thin. The bamboo shoots are not the woody, canned variety, but was fresh. The broth is not overly spicy, but just enough to give a little kick and it was nice and creamy like a good tonkotsu broth should be.\n\nThe yakiniku was delicious. It had the right amount of grilled flavor in it and was not overly marinated which can produce a salty flavor.\n\nThe staff was very friendly. Most of my dealings were with the co-owner, Lori, but I did have interactions with two other of the staff and they were helpful and friendly. Upon leaving, going through the door I shouted out the traditional \"Go-chisoh-sama deshita\" and both Lori and Hiro turned and waved from the kitchen. I don't know if they really know the phrase as she is fourth generation but I think he is second or third generation.\n\nThe place is very informal. You order and pick up at the counter. You get your own napkins and o-hashi (chopsticks) and water. Seating inside is small and there is some seating in an outdoor patio. All in all, a very typical Japanese restaurant.\n\nOne of the two Japanese restaurants that I would recommend so far. (Samurai being the other.)","stars":4.0}

Wether I'm coming in for a Porterhouse or a Sirloin w\/lobster tail (as I did tonight) the steaks have always been prepared to perfection, and the lobster was spot on too.\n    Our server tonight was Justin and he was wonderful. He greeted us in timely fashion, drinks were ordered and presented in the appropriate amount of time and he took our order with great care. Once the food arrived, as I said earlier, everything was done to perfection. Of course I finished all the lobster, and took half my pepper-bacon crusted sirloin and the other half of my baked potato home with m, duh. Justin made sure our food, drinks and attitudes were in the right spot the entire experience...thanks Justin.\n    Yes, yes, yes, we will be back for more outstanding steaks and the friendly, personalized service. :-)","stars":4.0}

There's really no room for making it 'exceptional' unless you go above and beyond in other areas, like a mini-scalp massage with shampoo or free 'touch-ups'.  That is what makes me like this place, also you can get a brief upper-body and full scalp massage added on before your cut.  I used to go to 'cheapocuts' because my haircut is simple, but if I can get a freakin massage with my cut, I'm sold.  So here I am loving Style Of Man.  The ladies are a bit pretentious, but as usual their above average beauty makes that 'OK' for some, and my stylist kept telling me about her boyfriend until I told her about my wife, then she stopped talking altogether.  Sure, I may not get a massage every time I go, but the free touch ups make it worth the exorbitant price.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I'm also from the Bay Area so my I have a lot of experience in shopping in Asian grocery stores. Given Reno is in a landlocked state without a lot of local produce grown nearby, this place is probably as good as it's going to get for an Asian grocery store. \n\nProducts: there's a variety of canned, dry and fresh foods. The quantity is low if you want fresh veggies or fruits. I only saw one package of taro leaves last night but if I were cooking with taro, I'd want at least 2 packages. They also sell fresh foods which i is my favorite thing to buy here. The variety is small - BBQ pork bao, mochi balls filled with peanuts and other items. They taste fresh. \n\nService: it's ok. Every time I come here there's typically one person working so there isn't much customer service but the people there know where things are located in the store so they might not be able to show you the location of the item you're looking for, they can definitely tell you where to go. \n\nPrice: eh, on the hide so for me but since there is little competition for Asia foods they can charge high prices. \n\nLocation: they're across the street from the Peppermill. They have a lot of parking and are relatively easy to find because they have a large neon sign on the corner of their property. \n\nOverall, I come here when I need something last minute. I'll come back but am totally hoping for another Asian store with more produce and lower prices.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"The Ritz East provides a solid venue to watch an independent film in the city, but it is actually my least favorite of the three Ritz locations.\n\nI end up here when a movie that I want to see is not playing anywhere else, and I certainly can't complain about the diversity and quality of films that play here.  Most recently I caught the Woody Allen flick, Blue Jasmine, but that is about as mainstream as the selections get.  The usual offerings lean to the independent, artsy, foreign variety, and the clientele is always there to enjoy the movies.\n\nThe stars are lost for overall venue quality.  Even though this Ritz is ostensibly in \"nicest\" location nestled in the same chichi Society Hill enclave as Zahav and Positano Coast, it has an overall run-down feel.  The lobby and concession stand are tiny.  A line forms out the door to buy tickets.  The restrooms have a weird porta-potty trailer vibe to them, though they are usually kept clean.  The theaters themselves also leave a bit to be desired with squeaky seats and stuffy ventilation.  The screens and acoustics are in good condition though, so they seem to have paid attention to what counts most.\n\nBottom line: if you want to see something that's playing here you will likely enjoy the movie.  However, it is not worth a special visit for the \"experience\".","stars":3.0}

The staff, what was there, could care less about functioning in any normal manner. If they could have just taken a video and made it a training video of  what not to do in food service,  it would have at least served some purpose. 20 minutes to see a waitress and get a menu when the place is 15 percent full. 20 minutes for her to come back and take our dinner order. My wife wanted the chopped cheese burger which apparently is only offered during lunch now  (It was 3pm) and only offered over fries for dinner. When we ask about just taking the bun from the dinner burger, Le Big Matt and simply substituting it in for the fries with the chopped cheese, the waitress said no.

{"text":"This place has great potential! We had a late Saturday breakfast that consisted of fish n' chips and cioppino. There is no doubt that the fish and seafood are absolutely fresh. The \"chips\" were soggy, but very flavorful. The only piece of advice I would give about the food is to use a bit more salt! This would really open up the already delicious flavors too. Crisp French fries would be a definite plus too.\n\nOur server was very pleasant, but very very spacey and often forget to bring items that we requested. Perhaps this server is new to the food service industry? It  was obvious that she  was trying very hard to be polite and courteous and provide good service. She just needs to get a bit more experience and maybe invest in a notepad so that she doesn't forget so many things. Lol! \n\nAll in all a good experience. We will definitely be back.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Be forewarned, if you don't have a reservation for weekend brunch you WILL be sitting at the bar.  Arrived and advised of a 30 - 60 minute wait for a table (I declined available bar seating). Cool.  After 30 minutes went to check status and was informed (albeit, very politely) that with the reservations they already had booked and the rate at which tables were turning over, it would be unlikely I'd have a table before 1:30 ( it's 11:15 at this point). Bar seating it is!  If you remember this place as Kreugers and have fond memories of your visits here, don't fret.... It's basically the exact same place (with less sausage on the menu).  If you're heading out to brunch to enjoy some amazing food, you might want to try somewhere else. If your purpose for brunching is to get a buzz in the AM without feeling guilty about it while spending some QT with a few of your BFF's in a trendy space, this place will do just fine!

They have an interesting drink selection including some of my favorite craft brews.  Schnickelfritz is available, and if you haven't had it, I would recommend trying.  \n\nOne issue is that there isn't much in the way of air conditioning at the establishment, so when lots of people are dancing, it can get extremely humid and hot---especially in the basement.  Please be sure you stay hydrated, as this could become dangerous.  Security is present on site, which should minimize some of the dangers of overheating & dehydration.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Unique dishes. Great brunch options. Fresh ingredients. Service okay. \n\nA highly buzzed about brunch joint this place is as good as it gets for brunch. I only minused a star because our service was a bit haphazard for our group of 6. Reservations are only taken for groups of 6 or more on opentable. For their high tea, reservations can be made with credit card only. \n\nThe space is large. With a clean modern look. White walls, with lime colored booths. The kitchen area has bright lighting and near the booths the lighting is more dim. Depending on the visit I would recommend this when asking for a seat. Although Sunday at noon there were no tables available and they were all completely occupied. \n\nFood was great. We started with the salmon gravlax with was was a perfect dish to share among 4 people. The flavours were tasty. With the pickled beets giving a nice bite to the salmon which was very unique. The homemade sourdough bread was hearty and crunchy just like in Europe.  They do make their own breads here too. \n\nI had the complete galette. A ham gruyere cheese crepe which had a nice saltiness in every bite. It was a savory crepe which reminded me of the famous French croque monsieur. I liked it. The buckwheat crepe was hearty and crispy which really gave it a earthy taste. It was a simple dish. But overall I was satisfied with it. My friend had the same dish and though it was too bland and simple compared to the rest of the dishes. We did share bites and the best dish I tried was the oeuf en cocotte. The rich dish was delicious and one bite was not enough...I will have to come back again just to enjoy that dish myself. The beef cheek farmers breakfast had loads of meat it you are into that. Everyone enjoyed their dishes overall. And let me tell you every plate was polished off at the end of of the meal. A great sign that the dishes were fabulous. Looking around it seemed everyone else enjoyed their meals too. \n\nPortion sizes are great too. Not too big or small. But I found price wise...the larger the plate the pricier the dish. For $2 or $3 more the portions were significantly larger. \n\nWe all ordered tea or coffee.  Any specialty coffees came With a little sweet meringue cookie. Our teas were served in fancy pots on a plate. The drip coffee was very good and quite strong. I imagine it being the same as the coffee as the duchess. The tea was described all fancy. Like green tea with jasmine and hints of rose. But it was plain old jasmine green tea. The fleuris tea was a typical clover tea and the Earl grey the same. They were strong but the descriptions definetly sounded enticing and did not really live up the expectations. \n\nFor dessert we decided to share all three. The pear ginger cake was delicious. Chocolate and warm it totally hit the spot after a great brunch meal and was not overly sweet. The lemon crepe was very good and simple. The grape crepe was unique and tasty. Honestly all of us liked each one and some preferred others. But I found them all unique and delicious. \n\nService was friendly and good. A bit haphazard at times. My friend was given a tea pot with no cup. Our main entrees were delivered before our utensils. Our water cups empty unless we asked and not refilled unless we asked.(water refilled only to the person who asked and nobody else's was refilled in the process). So it was enough to minus a star. Although one of my friends is terrible and math and jipped the waitress 75 cents. An honest mistake but she did however have all those occurrences happen to her on her birthday meal. She even wanted a celebratory after meal drink but was never asked and didn't want to bother the waitress since they were closing up and cleaning the place. They even split our bill nicely without asking. Which kinda resulting in some math since not all of shared the appetizer. \n\nBut overall. A very nice addition to the brunch scene. And my favourite in edmonton except for the fairmont Sunday brunch. A fusion of french and Scandinavian food that was really yummy. We all plan to return since it was that good.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I dont know why I gave this place another chance! The owner is a Nasty Witch. Horrible customer service. I left there over a year ago after taking Romey & Devi there for 5 years, And my previous persian, Peanut for over 10 years there. New owners took over 3 years ago and the customer service was never the same. Owner was nasty last time I was there, so I went to another place. This all after the other owner and the groomer ran out to the parking lot with my Persian cat to show me something on a major busy Road. Instead of calling me or yelling out the door for me to come back in. The groomer that did a great job on him left the place I was taking them for a year so I thought I'd give these guys another shot. They called me to let me know that Romey was gonna have to be shaved because of the knots of his undercoat. Which for years he has gotten after the Winter season because of the thick undercoat he has. Never in over 6 years has anyone said they have to shave him, except for 1 time on his back legs. The groomer would brush them out and they would just charge me more for additional brushing. They called me to tell me they were pretty much gonna shave him completely and I advised her I wouldn't be happy about that but obviously if I don't have a choice I guess I would have to live with it. The owner then calls me after this and says she doesn't feel comfortable doing it because I would be disappointed. So I tell her.... Who wouldn't be disappointed if their cat with their beautiful fur had to be shaved if it's not something that someone regularly does.\nShe asked me questions and continually interrupted me while I was trying to answer her.  After a bit of arguing back-and-forth she tells me my 1st baby which is Devi is done and I need to come pick them up. That she needed to work with her business and hung up on me! It takes me 20 minutes to get over here and I see Devi still on the table. She wasn't done! So now I gotta stand there and see this witch talking to customers when I more than anything wanted to tell the people that were in the store how terrible the customer service is there. I get in the car and I look at Devi and she's all still wet on her paws and fur and they didn't even clean around her eyes. Horrible Service and horrible job and now I have to find a place to take Romey to get done and I have never split up these two ever!  They are brother and sister and have never been apart. Awful experience! I should have known better when I had terrible customer service over a year ago not to try them again.  Lesson Learned!","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I have had Cuban food several times, in Miami and Key West, and I was a little disappointed by what I had here. This may be because this little restaurant is owned by a nice lady from El Salvador. I loved my fried plantains-so hard to find in the midwest!...the sauce they were served with, a mixture of ketchup and mayo...while perhaps traditional? was gross. The black beans were good but lacked the richness of flavor I have had in Cuban black beans in other locations. My entree was pork chunks which again, lacked the depth that I was expecting and were flavored mainly by grilled onions and their own fat. The rice was completely bland...just a pile on the plate to take up space. HOWEVER the pupusas and little quesadilla type things from Central America were REALLY tasty. My partner's shredded beef in sauce dish was good as well. Perhaps because we were here with a large group the food wasn't presented as it usually is. To emphasize this: the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Overall, I was underwhelmed. \n\nThe interior is pleasant enough, painted in bright colors and murals of the beach. \n\nI will definitely return to try some other dishes, but I wonder if this place wouldn't be better named as something besides a Cuban restaurant. I would love to see some empanadas like the ones I had in Costa Rica, and more of the owner's native Salvadoran food.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I wanted to take a moment to share my recent experience at Caf\u00e9 Madeleine on Mother's Day for anyone thinking about making a reservation for a special occasion. \n\nBack in January when I was looking for ideas on what to do for Mother's Day, I came across their website and loved the idea of dining at the Palm Piper House in Tower Park. I called to inquire and was sold on the experience that myself and my family would receive by booking for the special holiday. At the time the lady who took my reservation, said that I was one of the first callers to make reservations and took all of my information - this was a very easy and pleasant process. \n\nFast forward a few months to April, and it dawned on me that I had not received a confirmation or phone call reminder for my reservation so I called to double check. I left a voicemail which was promptly returned confirming that they had us on the list. When we arrived it was cold and rainy, nothing I was too concerned about because I was under the impression that we would be inside the historic greenhouse. Much to my surprise, we checked in and were shown to an outside table next to one shared space heater. The atmosphere was dreary, cold and extremely disappointing. Maybe on a nicer day, dining outside would have been fine had we been given the option but not in a forced setting. I politely went back to the check in area and addressed the seating arrangement with the gentleman. I realized at that time, it was a moot point as the seating arrangement was decided in advance; however, I told him of my disappointment and shared my feedback. He mentioned that upon reserving my reservation, I was told that I'd be outside which I explained was not the case. How could I have been told when I originally made the reservation in January? And on top of that, when I called to confirm no one told me about the fact I'd be seated outside - otherwise I would have requested inside seating or possibly even cancelled my reservation. It was not mentioned once, not even as a potential option. When I booked the reservation and when I arrived I was lead to believe that I would be inside. \n\nI went back to my table with my family, in the cold and tried to make the best of our disappointing start. Our server was not friendly, maybe she could sense we were not happy being outside but none the less she was unprofessional. We started by asking for coffee, my husband requested a hot tea for me as I am not a coffee drinker. She proceeded to say that the water was only lukewarm and that she wasn't sure if that would work - we asked for the tea anyway. It never came, so I ordered an iced tea instead. We requested more cream and sugar multiple times, and she seemed irritated even telling us to stop asking because she had it coming, but it look over 15 minutes for it to arrive (not acceptable). I've been to many restaurants and catered events before, this was by far one of the worst servers that I've had. Maybe she was not in a good mood for her own reasons, but she definitely reflected it in her work. To be fair, she left us alone after the initial drink order - we rarely saw her again until the end at which point she was more pleasant than the beginning of the meal. I did encounter other more friendly and professional staff members, so I know that this must have just been bad luck for us. The food selection, quality and taste was on point - because of this our experience wasn't a total bust and the only reason I gave 2 stars. Action stations were great and special shout out to the staff members manning them as they were enjoyable and friendly. Everyone did a good job with making sure there were fresh items replenished when they ran out and overall we were very happy about the food. \n\nThat being said though, at the end of the day we paid for the experience of dining at the Palm Piper House and at best we got a small glimpse of what it would have been like walking through on the way to pay the bill.","stars":2.0}

The gentleman working was one table away from me speaking loudly into the phone...normally this isn't an issue, but the employee was going about why his house may or may not be raided by the police. During the conversation he dropped a number of profanities while degrading the female on the other line. Apparently this wasn't just an issue for me.

As promised, just past the take-out area and through double-doors is Giardino's dining room. It's a pleasantly decorated, comfy, vintage Italian style dining area with booths and tables. The place is very clean and the restrooms are spotless. A sizable dish of potato gnocci with meatballs and red sauce provided lots of leftovers after filling my friend's tummy to capacity. The meatballs are large and scrumptious. My steamed clams with garlic bread were equally awesome. The clam broth was outrageously delicious. Our waiter was friendly, upbeat and efficient. Upon leaving the restaurant, he held the door open as an aid to my friend who is handicapped. How great is that! \n\nI couldn't resist stopping at Feast and Fancy a few hundred feet away after lunch.

I would NEVER buy a vehicle from them based on my experience, and should I have future service needs, I will drive to another dealership  - even if it is out of town.  Yep - that bad.  Now, read on if you're so inclined...\n\nI took my work car there 2 weeks ago as it seemed that the transmission was slipping.  It turned out to be another issue - a computer communication issue.  Ok, so far so good.  I picked up my car a few days later and drove it to my office.  After about an hour, I was ready to leave.  The car would not start; the battery was completely dead.  I called and explained that I had JUST been in the shop and that it appeared that they had put in a NEW battery.  They confirmed and said that they had been having issues with that particular battery and that I needed to come back in.  They did NOT offer to help, get me a jump start; nothing.   Fortunately, I colleague just so happened to be in & helped me.\n\nI drove my car to the dealership where I was told that they had to TEST the battery.  What?  I replied - \"You JUST told me that you KNOW it is a battery issue...\"  Nonetheless, I had to wait for over an hour and then nag for an update...which was that the issue was NOT the battery but a sensor.  I asked how long that would take to fix and received a shrug in response.  So I asked a more pointed question: \"Do I need to leave it here overnight?\"   Yes.  And can you get me a ride home, since I am stranded?  No.  Wow. \n\nFast forward a WEEK.  I get a call that my car is ready.  Yay!  So I ask \"Was it the sensor?  Why did it take a week?\"  Reply:  Nope, it was a whole lot of things.  We called your HQ and they authorized the work.  I said you should have run it by me!

{"text":"I have been coming for Heng's for many years when I come to visit family that live nearby.  Although I have never had their sushi, I have sampled many of their Thai dishes over the years.\n\nHeng's always has consistent service and atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is not overly big, but the design of the ceiling and table arrangements somehow make it feel larger and yet simultaneously intimate.  The place is always clean, the wait staff are always attentive without being intrusive, and typically orders are served in a timely manner.  I also find their pricing to be be very competitive with other Thai restaurants.  Of note, it is BYOB here so plan accordingly!\n\nHighlights of dishes I and my family enjoy include the satay (great peanut sauce), crispy taro, beef salad (the steak is cooked perfectly), pad Thai, drunken noodles, and Tamarind duck.  The curry dishes are also well executed and the banana sticky rice dessert is sweet, but not heavy.  I would not necessarily say that Heng's is the best Thai food I have ever had, but on a whole they are incredibly consistent and are a great restaurant for take out, a wonderful family outing, or a romantic couples dinner.  They are most certainly worth a visit!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"While staying in Indianapolis for a conference, I needed some serious caffeine. Luckily, right across from the conference hall was Bee Coffee Roasters. My first day there, I ordered a soy chai latte. My only complaint was after I left the shop, I noticed that my latte had milk instead of soy milk (but that's nothing a Lactaid tablet can't fix). The latte was really great, one of my favorites I've had. It takes a little longer than most places but it's because they steep the tea there and then make the drink with the fresh tea. They also grate cinnamon and at least one other spice on top (I couldn't tell from where I was standing). That was a great touch. Overall, completely satisfied with the drink despite the wrong milk.\nOn the second day, I went with a coworker friend and we both ordered drinks. This time I got a larger chai latte (how foolish I was the first day to get only 8 ounces... I'll never make that mistake again when the drink is this good!) My friend got the salted caramel latte. On this day, the place was packed, probably because of the conference I was at, Comic-Con, and all kinds of other stuff going on at the same time. It probably took 15 minutes or so to get my drink, which I didn't mind because I saw how busy it was. Unfortunately, they were not taking names for drinks, so when they called out a salted caramel latte, my friend and another woman both stepped up to get the drink. Not knowing whose it was, my coworker let the other woman have it. Ends up, that was my coworker's drink, so after I got mine, we just stood there not knowing when she'd get a drink. After about 5 more minutes, my friend let the barista know about the mistake and he did make her a drink next. She enjoyed her latte a lot.\nSo overall, I highly recommend this place for drinks, they just need to tweak a few things to get their ranking up to 5 stars. I understand they were just swamped on the days I was there, so it makes sense that little things would slip through the cracks.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I had my first experience at this salon about 2 weeks ago. I went there to get a new set of all gel nails. When I arrived the lady who was about to do my nails was sitting there eating. I asked her if i could wash my hands and she pointed to the sink. When I went to use soap, I realized there wasn't any so I asked her if there was soap and she just sort of shrugged at me? That was my first red flag. She then pointed at the chair for me to sit down.. she finished eating and then wiped her hands and sat down to do my nails. I am not normally the type to say anything but I work in healthcare and I understand the importance of cleanliness, and the MINIMUM requirements! I kind of laughed in disbelief and asked her if she was going to wash her hands.. she got up and washed her hands, but I noticed that not only did she care about replacing the soap for me, she didn't use any herself. :( When she did sit down I tried explaining to her what it was that I wanted- which was pretty basic- white tips with pure gel overlay. It took 2 separate phone calls to her daughter to translate what it was that I wanted... which honestly took about half an hour. As a customer I must say that this was incredibly frustrating. I tried to be as patient as I could but I am not kidding when I say she spoke absolutely NO English! And there was no one around to help translate! After about 90+ minutes of her completing my nails, they were done. I will say that for the first day I had them, they were shaped very nicely and seemed to be worth the $70 i paid for them. But within 24-48 hours I really started to look at them and notice how horrible they really were. :( The gel was set in really awkward places and shapes, my nails weren't straight from any angle.. they were already lifting, too!! Within 6 days I had 2 broken nails and because they were lifting so badly at the tips, the white tips now had an appearance of being grey\/black in some areas. They were awful! I will say that for the 2 hours I was in the salon that the actual hair dressing section seemed to really know what they were doing! I watched numerous people walk out very happy with the results they received there. And the staff was incredibly polite up front! My only complaint is in the nail salon part. I am not saying that everyone will have this same experience (I really hope no one else does!) but I just ask that if you are considering this salon, to really scope the place out first. The tools weren't properly sanitized, no soap was provided, towels were everywhere, the floors were dirty, countertops.. you name it.. and like i said, an employee who doesn't understand the very minimum requirement to wash their hands! Tsk tsk. I will not be going back to that nail salon!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Stick to the Mongolian BBQ & Chinese Buffet. The menu is not worth it. \n\nI would really like to give this place five stars. For a long time, I would just go to this place for the Mongolian BBQ and Chinese Buffet. But I finally decided to order from their menu, and I was quite disappointed with that. \n\nI decided to order from their takeout menu and my order took quite a long time. The place was quite dead, too. When I got home, my order was pretty wrong. Now I ordered through SB menus online, not over the phone, so there was no miscommunication. They had my order, in print, clear as day. How you screw that up, I'm not quite sure. \n\nI ordered the \"Complete Dinner Special A\" to split between myself and my girlfriend. I also ordered a side of steamed rice. The fried rice that was supposed to come with the dinner special was missing. Maybe they thought I just wanted steamed rice instead? Perhaps, but then why would I pay extra for it? It was an addition, not a substitute. My girlfriend ate the wonton soup and enjoyed it. The paper wrapped chicken was okay, as was the eggroll. Not great, just okay. I chose sweet and sour pork for my entree. I was disappointed upon looking at it, because there were clearly a lot more vegetables than there were pork, and the pieces of pork were tiny. What's worse is that when I opened it, it smelled horrid, like something had died. I tried it and it didn't taste as bad as it smelled, but it still tasted pretty bad. I couldn't eat it. My girlfriend gave it a go and couldn't eat it either. Extremely disappointing. \n\nHowever, the Mongolian BBQ is fantastic. I've gone here for it many, many times, and it's always delicious. The buffet is pretty hit or miss. Most of the time, it's not that great. Other times, it's quite good. Either way, I always limit myself to very small portions from the buffet. Save your appetite for the BBQ. The food is very filling, and you'll want to go back for seconds (or more), if you can, especially considering the price. It's a bit pricey, but worth it if you come here REALLY hungry. I usually prepare myself for it. Lol \n\nThe staff is usually very friendly, especially the cook. Every time I've gone, it's always the same cook there. Really nice guy and great at what he does. The soft serve ice cream machine is also good. \n\nI would give the BBQ\/Buffet 4 stars (only because the buffet could be a lot better, although you really wouldn't even need it), and the restaurant\/takeout menu 1 star. But to be fair, I've only ordered from the menu once. Maybe others will have better experiences. I, however, will not bother with the menu again.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"PLAZA CAFE & GRILL - Recently I saw that this was \"Under New Management\" and so thought I'd try it myself. I like to patronize \"local\" businesses more so than the chains and big box places.\n\nI got there this morning (Sat) about 11:30am, and was greeted by \"Wendy\", a \"Flo\"-like waitress\/hostess with a very friendly personality. She asked if I'd rather have a table or a booth; I responded, \"a booth would be nice\", to which she pointed to the booths and said, \"booths are over there!\" and followed me to my choice of booth. To me, that's NOT a negative; I'd rather have my choice of where to sit rather than to have to follow a host\/ess to THEIR choice of seating FOR me!\n\nOf course (coming in at 11:30am), the first thing that caught my eye on the menu was the hours for the Breakfast Menu is \"6am-12pm - depends on chef.\" I chuckled and asked  Wendy what that meant, and she said (honestly, she really did!), \"depends on if he feels like it or not!\" She DID add, \"he does do breakfast most of the day.\" We both laughed, so I counted that as just a little levity printed on the menu. I did notice their normal operating hours are 6am-8pm, Tues-Sun(till5), which I took to mean they closed at 5pm on Sun ... strange (closed Mon). I guess they are going for the Breakfast and Lunch crowd, but if THAT'S the case, they should serve \"extended Sat\/Sun breakfast till 2PM\". Better yet, and maybe eventually they will when they've built a clientele and reputation, stay open LATER on Fri\/Sat\/Sun and serve their dinner menu till 10pm - the standard for most dinner restaurants in St. Louis.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is quaint traditional, clean lines, and not a lot of \"kitsch\" and vendor advertising all over the place. The silverware was clean, but cheap, lightweight ware.  Menu pricing was about average for the area, but a little bit \"odd.\" For instance, there were items priced at $5.99, $6.57, $7.19, $8.33, $8.70, etc. So you kinda get the feeling that they are pricing based on a percentage of their cost instead of multiples of cost. Really gets you to study the menu, though (and that could be their intent!). Oh, yes... \"potato\" does NOT have an \"e\" at the end of it!!! Breakfast was a little pricey, but not overly so, and I concluded that is where they get their business so that's where the extra quarter or so helps with the overhead costs.\n\nI chose the \"Skillet - hash browns topped w\/green peppers, onions, diced ham, 2 eggs & cheese blend.\"  I expected it to be served in a skillet, but the healthy serving on a melmac  (officially, melamine) platter was fine. It was like a hash of vegetables (the chef also included saut\u00e9ed mushrooms in the mix) and diced ham, topped with 2 eggs and processed cheese slices. (I would have used shredded cheddar instead of the sliced cheese for better flavor and presentation.) \n\nNow, I gotta tell you...in SPITE of the processed cheese choice, this was an incredibly good menu choice, and a LOT of it! I know some of you can't eat food unless \"nothing touches each other\", but I'm a huge fan of one pot cooking and casseroled! The diced green peppers could have been saut\u00e9ed another 30 seconds to soften them a bit, but the diced ham was properly grilled, the potatoes (there IS an \"e\" in the plural!) were soft and browned  just enough, and the onions and mushrooms were perfect!\n\nWendy did the obligatory checking on me and asking if I needed anything else, or more coffee, but she did it with wit and caring. Yep, I over-tipped her!\n\nI'll be back.","stars":4.0}

Even though we had to take a Lyft back to where we were staying and it wasn't piping hot, it was still delicious. I had the saut\u00e9ed nopalitas and squash and they were delicious. I had a bit of the Indian fry bread with honey and powdered sugar and it was amazing. Next time, I will definitely order more!!!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I went to field house on a Saturday night. It was about 12:30am. Yes, it was late. But the bar was open until 2am. I was treated horribly from the minute I got there. The girl bartender (I am a girl and support women) acted annoyed when we ordered drinks, even though we tipped generously. Eventually, at 1:30, she turned the lights on and said \"please get the f*ck out of my bar\". We were appalled. I would understand this if the bar was empty (I have worked in the service industry) but it was full of customers. We tried to reason with her and eventually she started screaming at us. She acted so poorly that a crowed of people left. We asked her for a drink suggestion and it was like asking a 7th grader to do his chores.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I have to admit: I chuckled when I read some of the reviews for this place, since I'm from the Bay Area and there are a ton of hot pot restaurants around. And I guess because I'm Chinese, so I know what hot pot is and I grew up with it.\n\nAnyway, I reviewed this place keeping in mind the fact that it's the ONLY hot pot restaurant in Tucson and probably one of the few legit places for any authentic Chinese food: it's good. There's all the typical hot pot foods on their menu. You pick what you like, pick your broth (spicy or regular) and you cook raw food in the broth and eat it. Oh, and you make a dipping sauce to dip the cooked food in. Since my boyfriend makes the best dipping sauce, I usually tend to just eat it out of the bowl after I'm done with the food!\n\nThe one major gripe I had that made me knock off a star was the customer service. I don't know how many times I had to physically get up and go to the counter to ask for something for our table of 8 people. And no one explained the menu or anything to us -- maybe because my boyfriend and I were Asian? So they delegated the task to us? Still, it would've been nice to have someone give some suggestions and\/or pointers to our non-Asian friends. I also saw a mother and her daughter leave because they didn't get any menus or anything when they came in, sat down, and waited for about 7 minutes.

For the price, one would hope to have a large enough dessert to share.  Also the last time we visited, my boyfriend ordered fried chicken, something he's done many times in the past and never been disappointed in.  What he received that day was burned and dried out.  It was a dark brown in color, clearly overcooked, and shouldn't have been served at all.  We would have happily waited for some fresh chicken.

{"text":"Do yourself a favor and find another RV dealer in the Reno area, there are dozens of them, pick one that's not these people.  Heed my warning as we did not heed the warning of others and we're certainly sorry for our choice.  As most of the other reviews will tell you, this place has outstanding customer service up front, right up until you drive off the lot with your brand new trailer.  That is precisely where they discontinue caring about you or your $40k boat anchor.  That's the short story, if you're the TLDR type, you can move on to more entertaining things like snapchat or pokemon.  If you're the type that enjoys details, I took the time out of my busy schedule to indulge you below. (Yes, I did)\n\nThese people were epic salesmen; no pressure, gave us a great deal on our trade in, super friendly, we bought it - hook, line and sinker.  When it came time to sign the paperwork, they damn near rolled out red carpet.  I thought for sure the finance guy Bryan was going to wet himself.  He was a bit nauseating, one of those overtly happy people that just make you want to vomit.  However, he was harmless and did a great job explaining what all the paperwork was, son on and so forth.  They gave us an awful bottle of wine and even printed our picture on a calendar when we took delivery of the coach.  That, was where the honeymoon ended.  \n\nThe day we brought the coach home, the air conditioning didn't work.  Called to get it in for service, they're next available appointment is next month.  Talk to the service manager, he's at least accommodating enough to have me bring it in immediately.  Even though it takes almost a month to \"fix\" the issue, the air conditioning did indeed work by the time they were done with it.  The coach has a \"Polar Package\" that it literally says on the outside of the trailer \"Rated to ZERO degrees\".  Salesman, whilst selling us the trailer says \"Oh yeah, no need to winterize this baby, its ZERO degree rated!\"  You don't need a crystal ball to know what happened next; the water pump and the toilet pump burst over the winter and once I tried to hook up the water in the spring, water proceed to fill the trailer with water.  Quick call to the dealer to get it repaired and fix any water damage; \"Yeah our first appointment is in 2 months.\"  To this person's surprise, I agreed to this length of time to schedule repairs to my brand new trailer, however, upon scheduling the appointment was told \"Oh and since you didn't winterize, this will most likely be customer pay, unwarrantable.\"  Ok, I'll fix it myself, thanks for your time.  Fast forward to last week's festivities where the fancy auto-leveling feature ceased to function entirely and had to be manually retracted by hand in order to move the unit.  PRAY you never have to go through that exercise.  It took the better part of 2 hours to retract 3 jacks.  So, because I'd taken time off of work for this particular camping trip, paid for reservations and just wanted to enjoy some quality time with my family in my less than 1 year old trailer that I'm making monthly payments on, I thought, you know, I'm not going to bother calling these jerks, I'm just going to show up on a Sunday and leave my trailer there for them to work on it first thing Monday morning.  Get to the dealership in the morning, and the salesman that greets me says \"Good morning, looking to trade that in?\"  I say \"Does that happen often here?\"  To which he says \"Well, occasionally.\"  Comforting.  No sir, I'm here to get my junk fixed, which must happen less often than trading in a brand new trailer.  He says \"Oh, well our service department is closed today, you should have made an appointment.\"  Well, sir, I'm supposed to be camping today and instead I'm here, so should I go somewhere that cares about their customers instead?  He says he's going to get his sales manager, so I follow him in and meet Bryan(Finance manager from earlier, now GSM, as he referred to himself several times, even though his card still says Finance Manager) who proceeds to tell me that their insurance will not allow them to take possession of a coach, only the service center can do that.  Ok, Bryan, I can understand that, you don't want to be held responsible for damage to a unit that you don't show in your possession, who do you report to that I can drop it off at their house?  Bryan replies by saying that Camping World owns the dealership.  Great, who do you report to at Camping World?  He won't give out that name (Catherine and Paul McDonald for anyone who'd like to look them up on LinkedIn and give them a piece of your mind).  He tells me that if I call on Monday, they can set you up with an appointment for service, \"maybe 2-3 weeks from now.\"  \n\nLong story long, this place does not value it's customers after the point of sale.  Once they've got your name on the dotted line, they are done with you.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I normally come here for the sushi since it does appear to be the best quality in Tucson. On good days, the sushi is fresh, buttery, and is lighter. Definitely the freshest I've found here at the Old Pueblo. On any other day, their quality is still on part with its competitors.\n\nI've been going to Sushi Garden since before it moved from its old location (where Azian is now). They have really improved their image, moving from classic mom and pop feel to a more hip and pop kind of atmosphere. Pretty clean, but expect a wait anytime you come here after 5pm. \n\nI'm a big fan of the all-you-can-eat, but not happy with the fact that their all-you-can-eat menu is actually getting smaller and the price has increased to $21.95. When I first started going, it was $19.95. Still, if you come hungry, my battle plan is to start with 2-3 rolls and finish off with nigiri, since they charge you extra if you don't eat it all. You'll find that you'll get your money's worth of sushi that way before you feel like exploding. \n\nI did something different at the last trip and actually tried the ramen. I found it pretty plain and unimpressive. \n\nOverall, great place to go to get great sushi.","stars":4.0}

They definitely did not resemble the shrimps from the commercials on TV.  The endless special doesn't include extra sides - only 4 pieces of broccoli for $19.99.  They also only allowed one shrimp refill at a time which means that it would take you nearly 90 minutes if you wanted to try all 6 puny shrimp dishes - Which by the way weren't very exciting.\n\nMy daughter's child menu option of chicken fingers for $5.99 had a larger portion than my husbands $11.99 stuffed sole lunch portion which was so small I really felt bad for him!  Literally smaller than my fist and with a side of broccoli - also a whole 4 pieces!  His meal didn't come with soup or salad, either!  \n\nWe waited over 20 minutes for biscuits - they didn't arrive until we were half way through our entree.\n\nI don't know why we keep coming back...

{"text":"I encourage anyone having problems to report this place to the better business bureau,because I have decided I am. I deleted my review after the new manager had a talk with me and promised everything I had been dealing with for years would be made right. Well that never happened. Don't walk,RUN from this hell hole. They do a really great job at making everything seem really nice and convincing you that you will be very well taken care of. Well after a few months to a year once you have some issues or get a couple electric bills you will see that is not the case. It's insanely expensive and you get treated like dirt once you sign a lease. All of my appliances and sinks are from the 80's - 90's and broken,leaking,cracked,etc. The promise of receiving a free gift (carpet,new appliance,etc.) every year never happened. My carpet began unraveling at the seams within the first year,exposing nails. Their solution was to bend the nails over and put painters tape over it. Your electric bill is done by taking the electric from the entire building and splitting it evenly. So don't bother trying to conserve electricity because youre paying for everyone elses use too. My electric bill was once over $400. The promise of 24\/7 maintenance is a joke. I locked myself out once the afternoon before Christmas eve. I called emergency maintenance many times that afternoon & night into the following day having to sleep at a family members house. Finally I had to call a locksmith who charged me almost $500 since it was now a holiday. All could have been avoided if \"24\/7 maintenance\" had answered to just help me and let me in before it turned into a holiday. So don't count on them,they barely ever get back to you in any kind of timely manner. Having a washer and dryer seems great till you realize its an apartment sized old useless set. If you try and wash a towel or pants or anything more than a few small things it will take forever to dry and just smell like mildew by the time it dries. I don't even use it and go to a laundromat. I got stuck here because I was in my early twenties went back and forth between not being able to pay the outrageous rent and utilities AND save money to move\/also not being able to find another apartment that takes big dogs. It has been the worst experience of my life. When they told me they were adding an additional couple hundred dollars worth of utilities I decided to make it happen to move and get a house. I had enough. This place should be shut down. Can't wait until my lease is up and I can be out of this nightmare!!! Careless greedy crooks!

{"text":"All of it...it's all true... \n\nMy little Star Wars reference. But, in all seriousness, the five star reviews are true. My husband and I were looking for someplace special for our 23rd wedding anniversary. We usually cook at home, and my husband likes to cook for me on our anniversary, but this year I suggested we let someone else do the cooking and clean up of dishes. \n\nAfter researching all the fine dining on Yelp we narrowed our choice down to Beaujolais Bistro. We almost, for a nanosecond walked out because we overheard another table saying that it was the chef's day off! We came here to splurge and didn't want to take a chance if the chef wasn't even there. But, the people at the table next to us reassured us that it was delicious and we wouldn't even notice chef being gone...So we risked it and we were not disappointed.\n\nThe service is wonderful, efficient and courteous. The water glass was always full. That's a biggie in our book, as my husband drinks water like a camel. \n\nWe ordered the radishes to start and we were both a little taken by surprise since we thought they would be somehow prepared. Nope just radishes, cut up in bite-size wedges with a sprinkle of what I think was parsley, served with a dollop of sweet butter and a smattering of sea salt on the side. We clearly needed some assistance with this dish and the gist of it is that you can swipe the radish in the butter and slightly dip into the salt. I liked them plain, and if you are looking to lighten up the courses, the radishes are a good way to go because BB has a typical French style cuisine with sauces and butter and presentation. \n\nWe split a glass of Pinot Gris to accompany the steamed mussels, which was next on our list. The mussels were delicious served in a thyme white wine sauce, with a hint of garlic. The mussels themselves were plump and tender, no fishy flavor at all...just right. The wine was a perfect pairing too, we asked our server to choose it for us.\n\nNext our entrees. I only had one item in mind and after reading all the fantastic reviews I ordered the Steak Frites, medium rare. It's actually hangar steak presented in tender savory, slices, with a hint of sweetness. The french fries were perfect, Sort of shoe string not too narrow though, hot, salty, crispy on the outside, fluffy inside. And there was a Bearnaise sauce served on the side, which I almost forgot was there, because everything tasted amazing without it. My husband was having a hard time choosing between the Cassoulet, Sweetbreads and the venison. Our server really thought the venison would be perfect for him...and so it was. The venison came out in chops, hot, cooked to the exact temperature of medium rare, and tender. We asked, and although the menu changes daily based on availability and freshness, the venison is farm raised. Not gamey, but definitely different than beef. It is served with a side of spaghetti squash that is equally delicious and flavorful. Our entrees were paired by our server with the Cotes du Rhone for the Venison and the Cabernet for my steak. The Rhone had a beautiful bouquet, earthy, yet aromatic, floral and delicate, but not too delicate for the venison. My Cabernet was just what a Cabernet should be, stable and rich like a grandfather clock. Not sure why it reminded me of a clock, but that was the first thing that popped into my mind! \n\nWe almost skipped dessert because my best friend made us a gluten-free chocolate cheesecake and it was waiting for us at home. But, since it was our anniversary our server just had to bring us the pumpkin creme brulee. Creme brulee is my absolute favorite and if it doesn't have that hard candy surface it's ruined for me. This one didn't disappoint.\n\nDid I mention that our server gave it to us for our anniversary?! How sweet and kind is that?Sweet and kind is the Beaujolais Bistro where everything is prepared with love and  passion. And isn't that what fine dining should be about?","stars":5.0}

When I said this is not what I ordered the employee got very angry and said I repeated it to you. After a minute of trying to figure it out she came back and gave me another long, angry lecture about how this was all my fault and I could have prevented this. I said \"you don't have to be so rude. I am a customer here.\" So they she huffed and said she would have to try to find out how to recharge me and I would have to pull around and just wait again.

The decor is a bit stereotypical and the furnishings are a bit old, but what is lacking in trendy ambiance is certainly made up for in the quality and taste of the sushi!

I went straight for 4 types of sashimi and a special Mr Kaiser roll which was topped with seaweed salad! The sashimi was super fresh and delicate; I had yellowtail, mackerel, white tuna, and spicy octopus. The Mr Kaiser roll was spicy tuna and the aforementioned seaweed salad, which was splendid, I love the texture along with the smokiness (is that because of the toasted sesame seeds?) \n\nSo good!

{"text":"My friend and I went to Normas for dinner last night and had one of the worst restaurant experiences EVER.  We have both been in the restaurant industry for years, so we are pretty low maintenance but this was terrible.  First off, we walked in and waited to be sat for a few minutes.  finally someone came over, pointed at a table and rushed away.  We waited patiently, as we wanted a smaller table by the window and once again we were pointed at and rushed away.  Once we got to the table we waited about 5-10 minutes before someone came over.  when they did, they ignored the bottle of wine we had brought with us and quickly dropped water on the table and scurried away as if our table was on fire.  Finally we were able to place our order about 10 minutes later and our wine was taken away to be opened.  When the wine returned to our table, the \"server\" put it and the ice bucket it was in UNDER THE TABLE.   Didnt pour us a glass, didnt place the bucket on the table, but put it literally under our feet so that I had to reach down and lift the bucket onto the table myself. \nThen we got our appetizer of tzatziki.  for 6.95 I think it should have been a full bowl, but instead the plate contained about 4 tablespoons of the dip and came with a basket of about 10 pieces of less than delicious flatbread.  Then the salads arrived.  The dressing was bland but it was just a complimentary salad so I didn't get too bothered.  Then we waited...for 45 minutes...finished the bottle of wine...no one came over to the table once in 45 minutes.  Finally after an hour had passed since receiving the abysmal salads our moussaka came.  And once again was thrown onto the table in a rushed manner.  This mousakka was terrible.  There was not a trace of eggplant anywhere to be seen.  Both me and my friend felt sick after dinner and neither of us finished our meals.\nIn addition to the complete LACK of service and the less than worthy quality of the food, there was a poorly \"trained\" belly dancer who popped up every now and then and \"danced\" to extremely disruptive, deafening music.\nI will not be returning to Normas.","stars":1.0}

It came with your choice of potato and I went with the cajun fried potatoes which were just okay, seemed like it was missing seasoning.

{"text":"I went to Herbie's this past weekend to use a Travelzoo dining certificate I bought a couple months ago. I've been wanting to go for weeks, and finally made it out!\n\nFirst, we were seated near the bar area at a tiny table. It was fine, and we could watch TV, but pretty much deserted (just us and the bartender). When the waiter came to pour us some water, he spilled it all over the aforementioned tiny table. While I don't blame him for making a human error, he didn't even bother to clean it up at all! So basically, our table was sopping wet the entire time. Strike 1.\n\nFor our drinks, I got a mimosa (meh, decent), and my BF got coffee. The coffee was lukewarm and when he added creamer, it clumped up something awful. They were really nice about it when we pointed it out, and happily exchanged it for a bloody mary (which was not bad). But honestly, a brunch place that can't make a passable cup of coffee? Strike 2 in my book.\n\nFor entrees\/sides, I got the chicken fried steak with an egg over easy and the cheddar cheese grits. The BF got a classic eggs benedict and bacon. We had heard about how great the brunch was, and were willing to overlook previous travesties for a good meal. Alas, we were to be disappointed again. My chicken fried steak was so skimpy on the \"steak\" (which tasted more like hamburger mash) that I kept looking for more of it under the potatoes. It tasted mediocre, lacking much of the \"fried\", as well. The BF's eggs benedict had 1 lovely runny egg and another one that was pretty much hard boiled. It was awful. On top of that, his bacon was so badly burnt that it was practically black! It's appalling to me that the chef let that terrible bacon leave the kitchen, and speaks to the fact that the cooking was hasty, shoddy, and not worth even the discounted price. Strikes 3, 4, and 5. \n\nThe only good thing was the grits. I actually enjoyed those, although they were a little clumpier than i like my grits. I'll even knock off a strike for those.\n\nOverall, a pretty disappointing experience that I didn't think was even worth the 1\/2 off Travelzoo price. I don't think we'll be going back.","stars":2.0}

Once she did I had to get up from the table to fill my cup with the diet coke (leaving my food behind). Once I got my drink I was able to finally eat! Maybe I didn't understand that I was supposed to get my own drink? but the panel asked me what I wanted to drink and the plastic sign told me to seat and wait for it all?","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Worst Popeyes on the planet! Was the 3rd car in line at the drive thru today, and waited about 15 minutes to reach the order window. \nWe simply wanted 2 chicken sandwiches (1 spicy, 1 regular) and a large fry. Pretty simple order. \n\nAfter another long wait we finally arrived at the pick up window. We got our food and decided to pull into a parking spot to eat our sandwiches since we were a ways from home. I'm glad we did because after one bite of my sandwich, I almost threw up! The sandwiches were COVERED in mayonnaise! I don't mean \"extra Mayo\". I mean the person who made the sandwich intentionally put a disgusting amount of mayonnaise on both sandwiches as a joke or out of spite...\n\nI wish I had taken a picture to convey how disgusting it was but I was too concerned about holding back my vomit. \n\nTo end my rant, we went inside to get a refund and the manager (after one look at the sandwich) turned to the kitchen and started screaming \"Who's trying to be funny?!?\". They ended up replacing our sandwiches with something passable. I think it's safe to say we'll never be back. \n\nOne positive: the manager was helpful in resolving the situation.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I recently got to participate in a DishCrawl Indy event in which Scribble Food Truck offered to be one of the stops. Now, I'm no food truck regular, as not too many of them ever make it up to the north side, but I've been able to visit a few of them. I was expecting something similar to my visits to other food trucks; pizza, bbq, tacos, fries, mac and cheese, basically the kind of thing you can make without too many ingredients and effort and serve in a paper bowl with plenty of napkins. Scribble absolutely blew my idea as to what a traveling kitchen on wheels could deliver clear out of the water.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the food truck itself. I was expecting a big aluminum sided van with their name and logo painted on the side and a big generator strapped to the back. I couldn't have been farther away. Check out the pictures that Jon C. and Brittany S. were able to get of this cabin on wheels, and you'll see that it isn't like anything you've probably ever seen before. It didn't seem out of place at all parked up on the north side of Mass Ave.\n\nNow to the important part; the food. I got to try 3 separate dishes, and every one of them was spectacular. Again, not at all the kind of things I would have ever expected to order out of a food truck before my visit to Scribble. We had a delicious black bean patty topped with a fresh corn, pepper, and onion salsa. My favorite was probably the achiote shrimp with pineapple and mango. The flavors were fantastic, and paired together perfectly. Finally, we got a thai red chicken curry served over basmati rice that was a close second in my book, and even packed some heat. Each bite left me craving more of everything. The prices on their menu weren't too bad, and you could fill up on delicious out-of-the-ordinary food for under $8.\n\nThe third ingredient here is the person in charge. I don't remember his name, but he found the time to come out and tell us a little about himself and his business. It was very clear from the first sentence that he really loves his job and is passionate about making great food using local ingredients and doing it all out of a workspace that people wouldn't normally expect to get top notch food from. He said the menu changes often, and they source as many local ingredients as they can get their hands on. I'll definitely be back for a visit to Scribble, and hope that it has success in offering something different and fresh from a food truck than what Indy has had before.","stars":5.0}

It seems little but I've been to so mNy places that can't cook a burger.

So I don't think it's a big deal. It was tasty and pleasant. All around a chill place to be. Will be back for craft beer night!","stars":4.0}

They put up stained glass so it doesn't feel like you are floating in a parking lot. It's got character.\n\nAlso,  we tried the sandwiches today.

{"text":"I walked in on a Thursday morning and immediately saw the pool table, the businessman getting a manicure while sitting on a fat leather seat, and a cutie asking me if I wanted something to drink.  If I asked for a bourbon, I\"m sure they would have been accomadating.   \n\nShaving Grace is smack dab in the middle of MAIN STREET EXTON, a fairly new faux-small town main street shopping experience replete with high end chain stores and main anchor stores.  So it's a bit incongruous to step into a men's club atmosphere right next to the Bed Bath and Beyond.....but it works.  Everyone was super friendly and I got a great haircut and a close shave.  My barber, Mike, was cool and all the barbers talked about manly things like wrestling and baseball.  I put in my two cents and they all appreciated my input.  But I dare not talk about my favorite reality show, Project Runway and how psyched I am for the final episode where Christian, Jillian and Rami all go to Bryant Park Fashion Week.  I thought Christian would win easiily, but now I'm not so sure since Rami showed some.......oh, never mind. \n\nAnyway, everything was old school....except the price.   $35 for a cut and shave.  I guess that's to be expected, but the Hair Cuttery crowd (of which I'm a card carrying member, sad to say) will dig deeper into their wallets.  They do hold cigar, bourbon, finger food events from time to time and it's all free. So, check it out and get a nice cut....but don't talk about Project Runway, unless it's about Heidi Klum.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I've been here a lot of times since my last review, and I have to say... I'm losing the love. I tried to make this place my go-to after work hangout, but after two or three times I just got bored. I took some time off and tried again tonight, and I felt like I had to update my review. \n\nI finally had the pizza. More than once. Honestly? It was just okay. Maybe it's me but I cannot inherently trust any pizza place that doesn't just have a plain pepperoni on the menu. Maybe this makes me not a foodie anymore but I have lost the ability to care. I've thusfar had the mushroom pizza and the arugala and proscuitto. Both were good, but neither incited the kind of fire in me that I've seen other reviewers express. I also had the zucchini chips, which lacked really any sort of flavor other than oil, and the polenta with ragu. The polenta with ragu is delicious but I was really thrown off by the presentation, which consisted of two separate bowls and some sort of board and what appeared to be a short performance art piece. I understand when this sort of thing is done in restaurants, but at Reilly it just seemed superfluous. Just put the polenta in a bowl and bring it to me so that I can eat it. Don't mash it around on a board.  \n\nI feel like recently the quality of the food and service have both gone severely downhill. As I usually dine alone, I often sit at the bar. I have a cocktail or wine with dinner or lunch or whatever. My first sign that something was rotten in Denmark was that they stopped serving bottled wine by the glass, and while there is nothing wrong with kegged wine Reilly serves their red wine way too cold, which really kills the flavor. I usually have to spend the first 5-10 minutes with my glass trying to warm it in my hands until it becomes a manageable temperature. I often find that once I order food I fall of the bartender's radar completely, whether the place is packed on a Saturday night or there are only a few other people dining with me. \n\nThis evening I re-ordered my old standby, the peppardelle. At one point I had to ask the bartender if the recipe had changed because I was certain that I wasn't even eating the same dish. There were (I counted) three mushrooms in the entire dish. The rich, flavorful sauce that I'd remembered was just sort of a stew heaped on top of lukewarm, mushy noodles. I still love the atmosphere, the feeling that \"Aw gee look at what a hip place I'm at maybe that makes me hip too\" but I couldn't help feeling like some of the magic was gone. \n\nHopefully I'll come back in the future and all will be returned to the sparkly hipster wonderland that it once was. I just don't know how long it will be - honestly its difficult for me to justify the price for cold red wine and noodle stew.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"The Bucks Club has two nines that are VERY different. \n\nThe front nine is like stepping in a boxing ring with a sparring partner. You can build up a sweat, but you aren't likely to get hurt.\n\nThe back nine is like a title bout with Joe Lewis. It is an amazing course. Bring a referee and some smelling salts.\n\nThere are two things that both nines have in common:\n1. Most of the tee shots are blind, so you have to ride ahead in your cart to see the hole. If you don't do this, you will be in trouble.\n2. The greens have lots on undulation and are difficult to read. Case in point. Hole 13 must have at least five elephants buried under the green; its a long par three. I have NEVER seen a green with so many LARGE mounds. It is very easy for an expert golfer to three putt several greens (I did). They are not slow and the ball can get sucked into a valley on the green and roll away. You can be 10-15 feet away because you did not see the slope.\n\nThe other thing is that the greens are firm, so it is a good idea if you roll the ball up, rather than go directly for the pin. If you do go for the pin, you have to give the ball a lot of spin if the pin is in the front, which is very tricky because of the slopes. However, if the pin is back, you need about 20-25 feet to stop the ball. Again, go up and look at the green and what is behind it and how the green itself slopes. You never know what be behind it if you don't look.\n\nIt was a fun course, but a good golfer will enjoy it more than a novice. There are several holes with carry - if you don't get over the hazard, you are lost. The back nine has many more of these hero shots. Holes 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16 all require length and precision. The 18th has water in front of the green, so your drive needs to be long-enough to give you a reasonable shot over the hazard. I hit a 290 yard drive on 18, and I had 150 yards left. A 250 yard drive from the blues would leave you 190 yards over water. Novices would need to be smart enough to know when to lay-up.\n\nThe clubhouse is very nice. The grille and bar look out on the 18th.\n\nThis is one of the best values around - at least for public (daily fee) play. They do have memberships, but they don't tell you on their web site what they cost. Most semi-public courses publish that information, but they want you to call them. If you can't afford it, they will embarrass you - I assume. \n\nThis discourages memberships. So for now, put it on your list for daily fee golf when your home club is closed for a tourney.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Took my wife to Sama Sama for her first time. I've been for drinks a handful of times and had good experiences. Tonight was much different. We grabbed two open seats at the bar and ordered wings, French fries, and the rice\/ pork sausage dish.Wings were great. They ran out of fries and put in an order of potato wedges instead. \nMy wife tried the rice and immediately didn't like the taste. She told the bartender that she didn't like the dish and asked to order a second dish of chicken wings instead. The bartender asked,  \"Can you specify exactly what you don't like?\" (Because she would have to speak with her manager to see if it's okay to swap the dish for another.) This attempt to assess our concern came off as an effort to get the customer to justify why the restaurant should take back the dish rather than an attempt to make future dishes better.\nWhen she returned from the kitchen she told us that the owner said, \"Since we didn't like the egg, and the dish description has egg listed on the ingredients, they would not be able to remove the item from our bill but were welcome to finish eating the dish and order something else.\"\nNeedless to say, we weren't satisfied with that response. We continued to eat the rice that we didn't like, pushing the egg to the side, and then asked to speak with the manager. \nBartender said the owner\/manager was too busy, and we should \"come back when they're closed.\" (It was 8:15, they close at 10PM) We can clearly see to the kitchen that the owner\/chef was helping his staff clean up and could certainly come out to speak with us for 3 minutes. We asked her again to get her manager to come out, making it clear that we would not wait until the restaurant closed to voice our concerns. \nThe manager\/co-owner Ryan came out immediately once she got him and we told him what happened. He explained that it was likely due to miscommunication and that if he knew it was the taste of the dish and not just the presence of egg, he would have gladly just replaced the dish with something we liked. By the time he apologized we had already paid our bill and left a tip but he was gracious enough to give us a gift certificate for a future visit. We will likely use it on drinks but unfortunately won't be back for food. The experience was not a good one and we expect more from restaurants. \n\nTLDR: Paying customers shouldn't ever be told to wait until an establishment is closed to leave feedback and when they don't like a dish, just exchange it, and ask for feedback after they have something they're happy with. Paying customers deserve to get their money's worth and enjoy every part of their experience. Food, drinks, and ambiance were cool. A bit slow. Service was subpar.","stars":3.0}

I loved it so much that their shrimp remoulade would warrant a repeat stop. The chicken andouille gumbo was good but I am not so sure it was the best I have ever had. Still, it was tasty. I also had a daily supper special that was catfish covered in jumbo lump crab and shrimp. I think they called it a dressing. I will just call it delicious.

{"text":"I finally got to try out The Row for brunch and definitely plan to come back. The outdoor patio was great, there was no wait, its pretty inexpensive, and it was a really relaxed atmosphere where we were able to hang out for a couple hours. \n\nThe food: Check in on Yelp and you get a free fried pickle appetizer! These were really good, and the sauce that comes with them was even better. (May or may not have started eating the sauce by itself when waiting for my meal, and I think I spotted my friend lick his plate). The biscuits and jam starter was also another winner, the tomato jam was surprisingly good; pro-tip - you can ask for a side of gravy and get the best of both worlds. Our entrees were tasty as well, and the hot chicken seemed to be the best choice. \n\nThe service: I would give The Row five stars because it meets all of my qualification for hangover curing brunches, but the service was questionable. Our waiter was friendly and chatty but could not remember a single thing to save his life, I got the feeling he was hitting the peace pipe in the back instead of putting our order in. No surprise, our food took a while to come out. Fortunately we were enjoying ourselves on the patio so it was not a huge concern, and they did apologize for the wait. \n\nThe Row is one of the least crowded places in midtown for Sunday morning brunch with about the same quality of food as everywhere else. I was a big fan, and am looking forward to trying out their drink menu at the next brunch.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Too sweet and too pricey! \nThe pho here tasted too sweet for my tastes. But the fact that all the patrons in the restaurant were 90% Vietnamese shows me the authenticity of their flavors, which is a good sign! But as for me, I thought the pho broth was too sweet for my tastes and the prices were a bit too high for a lackluster bowl of pho (I got the Dac biet pho but only a small portion of meat was in my bowl). There are better pho places in Nashville in my opinion!","stars":2.0}

My boyfriend had the oyster eggplant pasta dish and was very satisfied, it also had a delicious blush vodka like sauce with a little kick. The oysters were fried to perfection and the eggplant tasted amazing with the sauce. The ambiance is casual but intimate and they have balcony seating. Great for date night but also a big oyster bar! The portions are manageable we were bith full but not stuffed. I definitely recommend stopping by for dinner! And they honor the free appetizer with 2 entrees!","stars":5.0}

Gene took the time to find a nature reserve to stop at on the way from the ceremony to the reception where he took many beautiful pictures of us. He is a very talented photographer and has a great eye for beautiful backgrounds. We had so much fun working with him and felt very lucky that he was available to capture our day! After the wedding, we were quickly sent a preview of the photos and updated regularly on when all of the photos would go live online and when our prints would arrive. The prints were packaged beautifully when they arrived and it was so fun to open them and look through them. Overall, it was an absolute pleasure to work with both Inna and Gene.","stars":5.0}

When I bought my ticket the woman told me she didn't have any change, and then when I asked to buy my parking pass (it is $2 and not $1 as I saw somewhere) she told me I would have to wait until she got cash in her register. I could have put it on my credit card with my ticket, but I guess she didn't hear me say I wanted one.\n\nSo then I went to the bar to get something to eat (and a beer, why not, it's Friday). The guy there said the bartender was running late but he offered to help me. I ordered the steamed buns, and he said \"So you can order food here or at concessions or at your seat in the theater with our tablets...\" Uh, I just ordered. I told him I would just order at my seat and I left. \n\nThe tablet ordering system did actually work the way it was supposed to, and I didn't have any problems ordering or with the system flashing.

It was as if I was bothering him by calling ahead for my order, which I usually do. Not only was the customer service a bit horrible, but also the food quality. \n\nThe rice was sooooo mushy and over cooked, I felt like I was eating a clump of slop. The loco moco was delicious though, minus the rice. Also, the combination plate of bbq chicken and bbq beef was dry and grizzly. We definitely did not get the best cuts.

{"text":"I should start by saying that I had never had Ethiopian food prior to my experience at here.  I was greatly anticipating trying out something new thanks to  Group On, but I left a little disappointed.\n\nThe service was fine, but the food took awhile to arrive at the table, which my dining partners told me is typical for Ethiopian food.  Just  a heads up if you are in a hurry.\n\nThere were four of us, so we ordered one Veggie Platter and one Taste of Ethiopia meat sampler which ended up being plenty of food ~$40.  Both things came with an ample amount of the cold bread that you use to eat everything with.  The vegetable sampler was OK, a couple of the things were similar to curry, while others we just pickles.  Nothing on the plate was bad, but nothing really stood out either.  The meat sampler contained one beef, one chicken, and one lamb dish all of which I did not care for.  The chicken and lamb dishes both tasted exactly like Bleu Cheese.  I'm not sure if was supposed to taste like this or not, but it was a little off putting with the rest of the flavors.  The beef was just kind of dry and bland.\n\n I think it is possible that I just don't care for Ethiopian food that much, which is not the restaurants fault.  Two of the four people eating seemed to think it was average compared to their other Ethiopian dining experiences, hence the 3 stars.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Fast food is fast food so quality is about on par but the workers here have guaranteed that I never try this location again! Atrocious service and very suspect business practice. \n\nNow, I can only speak of the people who work here around 10pm-3am since the 24 hour aspect is the only reason I go to get food here. I've given this place several chances and each time they've amazed me by getting progressively worse. Here are my late night experiences:\n\nFirst attempt, they locked the doors and when some friends and I tried the door they gave us dirty looks and waved us off. Went to Courtesy Diner instead. \n\nSecond try, the doors were actually unlocked this time but took an hour for water, 30 min for our food order, 40 mins for food to arrive, and an hour for the check! Should've just walked out since I never thought that when we went in at 1am we would be leaving past 4. \n\nLast try, waited in the drive through for 30mins with no orders being taken. Finally, a delivery driver walked out and said they weren't taking orders for the night. Lights were all on and they were sitting inside. \n\nAWESOME business you're all running there.

{"text":"Customer Service Review: Okay so the employees at this restaurant only experience with African Americans must be from watching Menace II Society. I say this because not even 5 minutes of me sitting down, getting a menu, and telling the waitress I need time to look through the menu, she goes to the back and comes back with two men who decide to sit in the booth next to me and not say a word to each other or me but one of them stays staring at me as if I'm not dressed like I'm obviously on my lunch from working at Nordstrom. Plus another dude comes out, assuming from the demeanor my hypothesis is that its the owner, so now all three of these guys are sitting\/hovering in the booth right next to me looking fucking foolish. So I call their bluff and continue stares back and take my sweet as time looking through the menu to marinate the awkward moment and waste their time and maybe see if they're just out there to be out there as coincidence or if I was the cause. The latter theory presented itself correct when I ordered my food from the waitress and they finally went to the back. Pussies. \n\nNo Bias Food Review: Trash seasoning and poorly cooked (I got the spicy beef). The white rice was the only thing keeping the dish from being garbaged. Instead of doing that though, I took my dish to go and decided to redo the seasoning and recook it myself when I got back home.","stars":1.0}

When I came back about half hour later, I realized why so many people had been waiting - he is a one-man show and he only has room to make each order one at a time. So, it's wonderful to get 100% freshly made, hot food, but you just have to be prepared to wait.  Plus - he has to stop after every order to take the money and provide change.\n\nHowever, the egg, cheese, and ham (although I think he used bacon instead\/also) sandwich on baguette was excellent!  Generous portion, full of flavor, and the bread could not have been fresher. Delicious!  I would definitely order from this cute food truck again-I want to try their crepes next.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"*This review is strictly about Sukho Thai's Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mow)*\n\nFirstly, I have eaten at multiple Thai restaurants over the past 8 or so years after I got introduced to it. The scenery is very nice. It is upscale and classy. Now let's get to the food itself. My favorite dish in all of Thailand is the Pad Kee Mow. No two restaurants I have been to prepare it the exact same way. They differ in noodles and accompaniments. \n\nSukho Thai's Pad Kee Mow has a brown gravy that the noodles sit over. This brown gravy is nothing but overkill. The noodles, meat, and vegetables are already seasoned to the tee, why saturate this plate with brown gravy underneath it? If anything, serve it on the side as a dip\/sauce. All 5 or so Thai restaurants I have been to serve the Pad Kee Mow as a \"dry\" dish not with broth or a gravy.\n\nNevertheless, they still receive a 3\/5 since it looks very nice on the inside. Good looking customers and somewhat good looking waitstaff are on hand. I have faith in Sukho Thai. Lose the gravy in Pad Kee Mow and you are the premier Thai food spot in Metro New Orleans.","stars":3.0}

Even the other customers are getting rude in this place. A random guy in line got way too into my business because he didn't understand a joke I was making with my husband. It's also impossible to get condiments at this location... I know the dumb policy that only ketchup comes with burgers so if I want BBQ, I have to pay a quarter. It's the policy and I try to make it easy...but they'll forget to ring it in and then get pissy when I ask after the fact. The aforementioned female employee threw some sauce at me and said not to \"worry about it this time.\" I was holding cash for it in my hand, very obviously. Glad I didn't pay because the sauce was expired anyway.  Thank goodness for the location a bit north that has decent acting employees. I get my Whopper fix there now.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I'm a former long-term Indianapolis resident but haven't been back to visit for any length of time for a decade. On the recommendation of a friend who shares my reticence regarding chain restaurants, my husband and I gave Stone Creek a try. The decor, ambiance, and service were all lovely. Although the tables are closely placed, the noise level doesn't interfere with normal conversational tones. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi served over dirty rice with bacon (stroke of genius, even if you're over the bacon craze). My carnivore partner ordered the New York strip, well done. Well-done is not my choice, but I think it's ridiculous when a restaurant attaches caveats and excuses disavowing their responsibility for quality when burdened with the order of a well done steak. There was no such quibbling, and his steak was perfectly prepared, full flavored, and moist and tender. Likewise, my mahi mahi was delicately delicious, subtly enhanced but in no way overpowered by the blackening spices. The dirty rice goes without saying-I would order it as a main course!\n     The wine list is nicely balanced, if not extensive, and fairly priced; I enjoyed the two Chardonnays I ordered. But-herein lies the one and only reason I'm not comfortable with a five star rating-my husband ordered two mixed drinks and was disappointed with both. The first was a tropical concoction of some sort, with rum, pineapple juice, and so much lime juice that it was rendered bitterly undrinkable. Thinking perhaps he had just not ordered to his personal taste, he abandoned the first after a few sips and ordered a personal tried-and-true, a Long Island Iced Tea. I know what those look like, even if I don't drink them, but what was delivered certainly wasn't anything I recognized-looked like a glass of lemonade with a little wispy dribble of something brown halfway down one side of the drink. Husband said there was no discernible flavor other than sweet and sour and didn't drink but a few sips of it. Not enough to be a deal breaker for this meal, but considering that between the two cocktails we're talking about nearly 20 bucks, it's certainly a concern. If I could split the bar rating from the rest of the experience, the bartender would rate no stars while everything else would receive a well-deserved five stars.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Down in Tucson, visiting family and they suggested empire pizza. What a mistake on a Saturday night!!! Placed order through grubhub, and almost 2 hours later it arrives. Grubhub estimated delivery at 45 to 60 minutes. At 40 mins. Grubhub shows delivery on the way.  At one hour I call the restaurant, girls tells me they are busy, but my delivery just left. Then I hear some guy in background ask if its the sandwich, I tell her no, then  guy gets on the the phone ands tells me driver is about to leave now, but has one delivery ahead of mine. 45 minutes later I call back to cancel the order and I get put on hold, while I'm on hold the driver finally shows up!   We ordered pizza, salad and soda.... They forgot the soda!\n\nThe good: the pizza was ok, and they driver did return with a soda in about 10 minutes.\n\nThe bad: girl on phone lied about order status, 2hours wait for delivery, and the Greek salad had way too many olives and feta cheese which made it so salty that I threw it away. Can't cancel a grubhub order, or withdraw the tip if u prepaid it.","stars":1.0}

Freshly squeezed and you can definitely taste the fresh oranges. We ordered the Mexican breakfast and Shrimp and Grits, the food took close to an hour to come out, but when it did finally come, OMG it was SOoo GOOD! My husband  LOVED the shrimp & grits, my Mexican breakfast was simple yet packed with flavor. We also got their homemade biscuits,  and let me tell you, those biscuit right there had me licking my fingers. I ordered two more after eating our meal and drink unlimited coffee which was good for only $6.50. The food was definitely worth the wait. The staff and live music was great!

She immediately started going to town on the back of my head with clippers, which is not what I asked for. I figured she knew what she was doing, so I let it slide. At the end of the haircut, something just didn't feel right. I get home and notice that I have a bald spot on the back of my head, not only did she cut way more than 3\/4 of an inch off, she cut it so short with the clippers that a bald spot was created. I'm pretty upset that nobody told me, because it was obviously noticeable. I don't like giving bad reviews, but they clearly messed up on this one.

Our server Aaron was a doll. We weren't totally sure about what we wanted to drink or eat. So Aaron asked us a few questions and promptly came back with drinks for us. He definitely pegged us. My boyfriend like his drinks on the stronger side and I like my drinks on the sweet side. He recommended a sazarac for him and an el Diablo for myself. He then recommend the shrimp yaya for a starter. I told him I am super sensitive to anything too spicy and he told me he would bring down the heat. And as a entree we decided to share the taste of the bayou . It was a sample plate of the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, red beans and rice, Cajun jambalaya and chicken and andouille sausage gumbo. We also added the grilled shrimp on everything. The shrimp yaya was phenomenal. It had the perfect amount of heat that didn't kill me. And the taste of the bayou was perfect for us to split. I enjoyed the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e the most. My boyfriend loved the gumbo and jambalaya! It really kicked off the beginning of the trip! \n\nAnd I wish we spent more time there for our next visit. I wasn't feeling to well so we got our food to go.

I hate hate hate to write bad reviews but I'm sorry, Best Nails -- I got icked out the last two times I went, and when I realized today that I can't bring myself to go back, I feel I should update my Yelp review, lest I steer someone wrong... \n\nSo yes, I'm sorry. The first time I went to Best Nails (six months ago), I dunno, it seemed a perfectly fine place. I usually go to Koko's on Ridge (fantastic spot, btw) so quite a few months passed before I needed another last-minute mani\/pedi but eventually I did, and, wow...  Best just didn't seem as good. \n\nFirst, they stuck my whole hands in bowls of acetone to soak off my old gel polish, which was kinda uncomfortable. I could almost literally FEEL my hands drying out in the solution. Also, it wasn't very effective -- polish stayed stuck, and the nail tech used a metal scraper to dig, dig, dig the flakes off. And then back into the solution. And then more digging & scraping. Then back in the solution. Then more scraping...\n\nIf this had only been a one-time thing, I'd pass this off as an inexperienced nail tech or something but no -- the next time I went, the same ordeal. Except this time, the old polish was so stubborn they eventually used the electric sander thing to abrade it away, buzzing down past the polish, I think, and shaving off layers of my actual nail. It kinda hurt!  :-(   Not to mention, after soaking in acetone during my entire 20 - 30 minute pedicure, both my hands were left uncomfortably chalky & wrinkled. \n\nAt my manicurist's table, I noticed everything was covered in a fine coasting of nail dust. Furthermore,  I don't believe I recall seeing autoclaves, plastic-sealed tools, jars of blue sanitizer, or any other signs I've come to understand as hallmarks of nail salon hygiene. I might be wrong and if I am, please forgive me but the last time I was here, I left with a distinct impression that corners were being cut, and my comfort\/safety was being compromised. A horrible thing to say, I know that, and I truly hope that this place is just going thru a little blip but will be back on track for the Summer season. \n\nOnly, someone else will have to write that review.

{"text":"Horrible. Disgusting. Over priced. One of the worst meals I have ever had. The poached eggs on the Eggs Michael were well cooked and the only thing good about this meal. The sherry sauce was pasty, the mushrooms in the sauce were rubbery, the English muffins were untoasted, and the sausages were greasy and spongy. The potato pancakes were so sour (yes sour) they were inedible. Hubby's diced ham and eggs looked like something off the line at a elementary school cafeteria. The scrambled eggs on my kid's plates looked like they came out of a container and had an artificially orangish hue. The pancakes my kids ordered were in the chewy side and didn't taste very good - particularly for a place featuring that product in their name. The butter (if it even was butter) was whipped and very salty.  The syrup flowed like water.  Even artificially colored and flavored corn syrup typically has at least a modicum of viscosity. The sour potato pancakes left my mouth burning. I learned from the manager that they mix in citric acid powder to keep the potatos from browning. Perhaps they didn't mix it in well enough and I got all of it. I hope nobody with a deadly citrus allergy orders them. The coffee was bitter (not good bitter) and the cost was outrageous. This one goes into the \"oh, hell no, never EVER again\"list of restaurants.  Save yourself the agony and money. You will get a much better breakfast at McDonalds at a much better price.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"My review is for Sales Professional - Ashley Sledge! Ashley restored my faith in Ashley Furniture Home Store. I've purchased several things throughout the years from this store, but no one has provided top notch customer service through our past transactions. After my husband and I purchased a bed that we had been eyeing for close to 2 years, waiting for it to go on clearance, and having a very frustrating experience both with sales and deliver, we very hesitantly went back to this store in search of home office furniture which we were not finding at other stores. From the first greeting, through all the time spent at the store looking at options, Ashley was extremely professional, polite, knowledgeable and helpful. His follow up was excellent and we are overall exceptionally pleased with his service. Unfortunately, there were delivery issues again with these items, through no fault of this sales agent, yet he made himself available outside of business hours and on his mobile phone to try to help us. This gentleman should be the store manager! The other store managers or assistant store managers have no real genuine customer service care in our experiences. I've spoken and worked with at least 3 of them over the past few months due to the issues with our prior purchase, we've always been respectful and polite, but they just aren't either trained well, or geared toward excellence in customer service, like Ashley is. I hope Ashley gets the recognition he deserves, and the opportunity to grow within this company. This store could be great if everyone had an ounce of his work ethic and customer service excellence!","stars":5.0}

Because of that their flavors tend to be very seasonal, which I think is very cool.

But for the more conservative folks they also have plentiful traditional flavors as well. ( mint chocolate chip is to die for!)\n\nThe only negatives ( if you can call them that) I would say is that is popular, so occasionally it gets busy and also, it can be more expensive than your local neighborhood place. \n\nI live 25 minutes away from here and drive here just for the ice cream.

When I looked in, the spinach was all on one side, the cheese on the other.  The dough was good, and not greasy, but something seemed missing.   \n\nMaybe it was too healthy (even though I always opt for the baked version)?  The spinach was very fresh, as was everything else.  \n\nOther staff ordered pizza, and both hot and cold sandwiches.  All nice sized and everyone who I talked to, enjoyed theirs.

{"text":"This hotel is in the idea spot. However, as an elite member we had 24 hour access to the M Club. The breakfast was good but they constantly ran out of food. The evening appetizers were nice but again they constantly ran out of food. I'm pecsectarian and I was told I could put in a request for the chef to make something for me conducive to my diet. Well, the first day he did. The following days I was told he couldn't do that anymore. Then I asked for additional vegetables that were on the buffet and I was told they didn't have anymore. This was told to me at 530 and they start serving at 5. The vegetables ran out each and everyday that I was there. The M Club was not a happy experience. I also noticed a lot of non Elite people coming in and eating that shouldn't have. Upon my check out I had been charged 3 charges for utilizing the Club. If I hadn't looked at my bill it would have been a mess on my credit card. Also, the water pressure in the rooms are a joke. It took 20 minutes to wash shampoo out of my hair.

Really enjoyed this place, the only drawback is how dang expensive it is. As for my delivery experience using Door Dash, it brought my rating down by a star because they gave me the wrong type of burger even though I checked the correct one and also included the name of it in my instructions.

When we checked in there was a notice that the pool and hot tub were closed for maintenance and had been down apparently for a while.

{"text":"This is the closest \"Packer Bar\" to our home so we decided to take in a Sunday game along with other fans. \n\nFirst, the bad stuff. Although they tout dozens of TV's they're all fairly small for a sports bar. None of the TV's were bigger than ours at home. Watching the game from near the back of the room was a challenge. It was hard to tell what was going on a lot of the time on the TV.  It would be great if they invested in one huge TV for that dining area or at least had a projection system or something. Trying to watch half a dozen small TV's showing simultaneously is a chore.\n\nAs for the food, it was decent but nothing spectacular. We started off with the appetizer sampler which was listed as onion rings, zucchini strips, and mushrooms beer battered and fried and served with ranch dressing on the side. Sounded good. Unfortunately, when they arrived someone in the kitchen had decided they needed a little something extra and had dumped about half a jar of horrid powdered cheese on top of them. They would have been decent had it not been for that. The powdered cheese made them horrible.\n\nFor our main dish we had the Firework Chipotle Chicken sandwich with fries. The sandwich was decent but nothing incredible. Very basic bar and grill type fare. The addition of the \"bottlecap jalapenos\" was nice and added some kick to the sandwich. Without a doubt the best part were the fries which were fresh and nicely hand cut. While not in the same league as Five Guys they were better than fast food fries and substantially better than most chain casual dining restaurants that serve fries. \n\nDesserts aren't listed on the menu but we asked our server about them and she informed us they did have a few things available like chocolate cake, ice cream or deep fried brownie bites. We opted for the brownie bites and they were quite good. She'd said they came with a scoop of ice cream but when they arrived it was simply whipped cream with a little drizzle of chocolate sauce. Regardless, they were delicious and hot with a crunchy exterior and wonderful soft chocolate interior. \n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable for a sports bar and grill and we did have a good time watching the game with other Packers fans and cheering. Although we'll opt to watch games at home thanks to a better view of the TV, we still will keep Famous Sam's in mind for important games that aren't televised locally.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my wife and 12 year old son. First, the good... its a real nice place, very clean, good atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and helpful (although the greeter lady had a thick Italian accent, so listen carefully!)  We had no wait, but it is fairly small so I could see that being an issue if you go at the wrong time.  Food came out quickly, although it was before the dinner rush so not yet crowded (it was filling up as we were leaving).  Pretty good selection to choose from.  The food I'd say was good, but not great.  Probably not the best I've ever had, but I generally concur with the other reviewers and I doubt many will have an issue with the quality of the food (it definitely was fresh and we saw no problems whatsoever with the preparation, it was more a question of not loving our own choices).  Portion size also seemed good (I finished all of my entree, my wife and son had some to take home, all regular sizes).  The salad I had (baby arugula with mozzarella and prosciutto) was especially good!  Our one big problem was the price: $127 before tip in total.  That seems a bit steep for three people, and nobody ordered anything crazy.  Now, part of that was not asking for the prices of the specials ($30 for my entree, a pasta with seafood dish, and $15 for that admittedly excellent salad, which was NOT entree-sized but nice for a side dish)... but that aside, it was still quite a bit.  Obviously the question is whether a meal is worth the price you pay regardless of how much it is.  While it WAS a good meal, we didn't feel it was $127 good.  So, the bottom line for me is if you go here you'll probably enjoy it, but prepared for the bill lest you have sticker shock like we did.  FYI, I've eaten at a number of authentic Italian restaurants in Boston's east end... I'd say the food at this place compares pretty favorably, but its a bit overpriced in comparison.  Nice to at least have such an option in the area though, that's for sure!  If not for the price I'd have given this four stars without hesitation, and I wouldn't argue with anyone that says five stars.","stars":3.0}

Jelly Donut is a lot like the ones my grandpa took me to in the 80s in that it's an EARLY morning operation. \n\nWith this being said its considerably cheaper than going to one of the nouveau donut spots and has a distinct difference in style when it comes to things like apple fritters. \n\nSo I took a star away simply because the stock is so volatile, but to give it 1 star like the other recent review is just childish. The lady running this location is always nice to my daughter and tosses in an extra treat with our drive thru orders. \n\nIf you're up early, give them a try.","stars":4.0}

When you walk in, it's really easy to get wrapped up in how interesting of a place this is. The rustic wooded look is so welcoming, comforted by the calming blue accents throughout. You gotta really give it to whomever is responsible for such a cool spot because every detail has been thought of. \n\nThe food?!? DIVINE! We went for brunch and couldn't decide between the lemon poppyseed pancakes and the French toast, so we ordered both and shared. There was enough food for like 4 people. It was absolutely delicious  Can't wait to get back here!","stars":5.0}

Excellent location in the middle of the Summit Sierra Mall, in between South Virginia Street and I-580 (HWY 395). The inside is super nice with a high quality buildout. The top of the bar is electrifying that has LED color changing lights. \n\nKyle who was tending bar was super kind and always making sure things were right as he managed all the customers the entire restaurant on point. He was great! The pizza and other food options are the same as the other locations. It's some of the best pizza and wings in town.

I've walked in twice in the past two weeks to inquire about upgrading my iPhone and neither of the two people behind the desk cared to acknowledge my presence or offer to assist me.  On the first visit I approached the counter and the woman gave me such an attitude while she was shuffling papers around that I felt as though I was interrupting or bothering her.  On the second visit, again no one assisted me while I browsed for about ten minutes.  During this second attempt, I witnessed one of the sales reps practically yelling at another customer because she was not clear about what product she wanted to buy and how she wanted to use it.  Lastly, the store has very few functioning devices on display, so you can't truly compare various devices.  \n\nPerhaps their service is so poor because they are not owned by AT&T corporate, although the directors at AT&T should be concerned that this store is hurting their reputation.  \n\nIf you're shopping for a new phone or need any other assistance from AT&T, don't come here.","stars":1.0}

Still, they seemed to do a great business for the evening. I had the daily special, the Rodeo Burger. It was two all beef patties, bacon, cheddar, onion rings, lettuce, tomato, and Honey Badger BBQ sauce. Wow! It was a hunk of a burger without being too much! The flavor was outstanding and somehow even with all of that on it, the bun held together! The other hit of the evening was the 4x4-- Four smoked wings and four ribs.

The next question I have to ask is what the clientele looks like:  is it a Mexican restaurant filled with chubby Americans?  Basically, do the customers match the cuisine.\n\nSushi Garden is almost always busy.  The interesting thing is that there is a pretty big mix of people in the store whenever I go.  I think that's because it's one of the best sushi options in Tucson, but it's also telling that a variety of people can find what they want there.\n\nEven more interesting, this is a sushi restaurant in a land-locked state.  It's not going to be the most amazing, freshest, write to your congressperson its so great raw fish.  That being said, it is consistently good and relatively cheap!\n\nWe got a few of the salads, and they were also pretty good.

The locker room is lean and the people who work there are responsive.\n\nMinuses include how the free weights are always racked completely randomly.

{"text":"Some friends and I stopped in having brought our own copy of Tales of the Arabian nights to play. The adequate selection beer is reasonably priced with the option to \"test your luck\" by rolling a die to get a discount off of your random drink. \nAround 6 when we arrived, the bar was relatively quiet for a saturday, we grabbed an open table and started setting up the game.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and someone I believe was the owner stopped by to chat about our game, as it wasn't in their collection.\n\nThe looking for group and looking for player flags they have for patrons are a great idea, but mileage seemed to vary for effectiveness and we witnessed a few people leave after a short period of time, having not played a single game.\n\n\nThe venue is great, but there are a few things would consider before stopping in.\n\nConsider what game your are playing if you want to being your own. Many of the tables are a little on the small side for heavier games and the largest tables seem to fill up fastest, so keep the footprint of the game you play in mind.\n\nIt gets a bit noisy as the area fills up. This may seem obvious, but with a lot of people having a blast with their own games, it could make your game move more slowly if things need to really be heard.\n\nMake sure you know the rules well. As, once again, it can be loud. Teaching a fairly complicated game was less than ideal in the space.\n\nDefinitely check them out, but bring a group favorite game to ensure the best time.","stars":4.0}

My husband got the tenders, hot, with pimento mac and cheese and baked beans. We didn't wait long for the food after finding a place to sit. My chicken was out of this world! The spice was perfect and the chicken was tender. Not the most moist chicken I've ever had but it wasn't dry. My husband loved his tenders. He said that it was the perfect amount of spice - his lips burned for a while after he was done eating. The sides were disappointing. I liked the pimento flavor in the mac and cheese, but my husband thought it was lacking. The cheese sauce tasted like Velveeta, not real cheese. The coleslaw was bland, I've had better. The baked beans tasted like Bush's, straight out of the can, heated slightly. But.... The chicken is worth it!!!","stars":5.0}

The room was made up early on 2 of the 3 days and always very nicely.  The restaurant was under renovation while we were there but we did have drinks at the carousel bar - the bar itself, the drinks and the service were all top notch.

{"text":"We just checked in. It's my birthday weekend so we thought we would splurge on a super nice room. We've never spent $300 on a room so expected much more. We paid $325 and this is what we got...\n-we booked a king bed room, the bed is queen at best. The quality of the bed is cheap, like an ikea bed frame where you can feel the box spring. The linens are atrociously super cheap. We've stayed at a Radisson for $135 and received a huge king with unbelievable linen, comforter, pillow quality.\n-one of the biggest problems we have is when you walk in the bed is not facing the tv, they have a huge vertical cabinet that blocks the tv so you can't actually see the entire tv and you have to watch it sideways When we brought this issue up and asked if they had other layouts they said all the kings are like this layout. They asked us if we wanted to see the two queen size room, while the purpose of being a couple Is to sleep in the same bed we checked it out. The two queen bed is slightly bigger than a double size bed at best. \n\n-the other issue is for a $325 room there is no bathtub. I'm also disabled person so cannot get into a standing shower. Also the purpose of spending $325 is to pamper yourself and take a bath which is what I planned to do. No king rooms have bathtubs. For $325 that is ridiculous. The room is fine for $140 but not $325. Not even close.\nWe spoke with the desk concierge and though he was nice he came away with the only option of giving us the two queen (really double bed) or 3, 000 membership points. We don't have a Marriott membership but he said for an actual night at any Marriott we would need 40,000 points which makes that gesture virtually useless.\n\nAgain, never spent more than $300, we've been in $300 before and the luxury was outstanding. This is not. No microwave, no bathtub, can't see the tv, cheap uncomfortable bed, the cheapest linens, the smallest king size bed I've ever been in...not worth it and we'd never stay here again and recommend the same to you. Extremely low quality for the money. outrageous we spent that for this. Also the concierge went back and talked to the manager, the manager is the one who offered us the 3,000 useless points, and when the guy came back out the manager walked out behind him and wouldn't address us and too busy to speak or accommodate our issues. Too busy avoiding customers.","stars":1.0}

Also let's talk about the \"large fries\"- it's hardly shareable, it feels more like a single serving of fries and it costs $1.50 than the burger! Something is just not right! I also gave the spiked milkshakes the old college try and was sorely disappointed. My milkshake was lukewarm- it tasted like a bunch of booze and a splash of milk. I was expecting more of an ice cream texture and didn't get it at all. Also they are so small for the price you pay- I was also expecting the milkshake plus the silver container with \"leftovers\"- the spiked milkshakes are about 12oz and $10- not worth it. I really had high hopes for the diner and was disappointed.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I'm now a huge fan of this place.  Came here on a Thursday night and got the last two top available.  Watched as many tables left and other folks filled them.  Had the Duck confit and the chicken wings.  The chicken wings were badly over cooked and not to my liking but everything else shined here.  For the main course I ordered the Duck Breast and my wife ordered an entr\u00e9e salad.  both were outstanding.  We loved the live music and the ambiance.  It was a little strange that the owner came by and said hello and introduced himself, we told him it was our anniversary.  Then the server came by and wished us happy anniversary too nice touch but we since we ordered a big tab with drinks, a bottle of wine, apps and entr\u00e9e we thought he might offer up a house dessert..no such luck.  I'm so used to serving everyone else free stuff, I guess if you're busy you don't need to.    Loved the music and will definitely return.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The menu is gigantic, and the servings huge. The staff, however, is hit and miss. They need to wear name tags, or at least introduce themselves.  I saw a server playing with her long blond hair constantly.  Mine gave me coffee, but no spoon.  She kept calling an elderly male\/female couple sitting near us \"You Guys.\"  She went off to get us extra napkins, but then stopped to put something in the sink, and forgot about the napkins.  When the food came, the vegetables were missing.  However, we've had other servers there that are terrific.  The male owner\/manager is friendly and helpful. The female one acts bored. So proceed with caution.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"You want a fresh, hot, tasty breakfast or lunch, but you want to be outside of the Nashvegas hype bubble and don't want to go to a chain?  Look no further.\n\nI was going to order huevos rancheros but they warned me that they were out of beans, so instead I had what the menu described as \"Egg Sandwich with Applewood Smoked Bacon, Mayo, Vermont White Cheddar on Toasted Tuscan Bread.\"  I like all of those things, but when I read it, I have to confess that \"mayo\" fell into the which-one-of-these-is-not-like-the-other-ones kind of thing and I was not sure exactly what to expect.\n\nWhat it *looks* like is a grill cheese sandwich on really nice bread with bacon and egg on it.  I suspect that the mayo was used in lieu of butter to \"butter\" the bread rather than as an add on topping.\n\nWhat it tastes like is fresh and delicious.  Boom!\n\nSoup of the day was Tuscan Pulled Pork.  Yeah, that's a soup.  They gave me a taste of that too.  I seriously should have gotten some of that to go.  Like about a gallon of it.\n\nDefinitely going back to try some lunch items.  This was a find!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I was really excited when the street car had a stop by here because I love going to breweries.  But this was not what I thought at all.  We walked in and the place was really quiet, with a couple of people.  We sat at the bar, and started to look over the menu, but couldn't find any of their beers on the list.  And when we looked at the taps, they all were all beers from different breweries.  When I asked the bartender what Jackson Brewery beers were on tap, he said that the Brewery stopped making beers years ago and it no longer exists, only the building is left for other businesses.  Instead, they serve local craft beers from all around Louisiana.  Having never had beer from Louisiana I did a flight, which came with four samples.  I tried the three IPAs that were available and a coffee porter.  Unfortunately, all of the IPAs were really weak and not that hoppy, which was disappointing since IPA is my favorite kind of beer.  When I asked the bartender about what are some popular IPAs from the state are, he told me that not a lot of people like IPAs; but more breweries are starting up around the area, and they always carry an IPA just to have one.  Okay... Maybe I am too Pacific Northwest, but it was still disappointing to learn of the beer scene in Louisiana.  The bartender was friendly though hence the two stars.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"What a great find! I had been craving a creamy seafood dish and did a search around our hotel since it seemed like a storm was coming. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the casual feel, sort of an upscale, old school Long John Silvers vibe with a bar in the middle. Perfect for us. I ordered the shrimp and scallops pasta which was soooo good! Thick and creamy with lots and lots of scallops. Shrimp were a bit more scarce but I wasn't displeased at all. My husband had the scallop and shrimp skewers with asparagus and rice. Delicious! Best treat ever was the Shark Attack drink for $1.99! Sprite and grenadine with a souvenir shark! An absolute simply for the novelty of it! We loved it. We'll be back!","stars":4.0}

I've had lots of frustrating experiences looking for a quick this or that and being told I had to leave my bike for a few hours or come back tomorrow to drop it off. That's why I went to the Stable to have my wheel checked out and I ended up buying toe clips and pedals because I mentioned wanting to change mine. After he checked my bike for a sound (for free, including riding it) he helped me pick out some new pedals, threw em' on and bam I was out on the street 15 minutes after I walked in.

{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant and I go there all the time. I recommend making reservations as they could be crowded any night of the week. I don't think it was fair for the person who gave them one star to do so because they had empty tables and wouldn't seat a walk in. That's not poor customer service that's good service to regular customers who know they have your table ready when you come for your reservation. The food is fresh, perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. I have never had a bad meal here. Have visited with a party of two or twelve and everything in between, everyone is always happy. You can buy wine there or BYOB. They will open your bottles, provide an ice bucket and glasses. Mimi the hostess and all the staff are excellent.

{"text":"Jamonera has been on our list of restaurants to try and we stopped one Saturday early evening hoping for seats at the bar to grab a drink.  We walked into a long bar and tight and snagged two seats at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and working hard. \n\nI ordered the Bizet cocktail (spanish vodka, passionfruit, clementine, and thyme). Amazing! What an awesome drink! I don't like cocktails that are too citrusy-y or orange-y and this was spot-on.  Very refreshing for a spring day.  \n\nFor food we ordered the papas fritas, which were fried potatos that were really taste.  We also ordered the calamari which is cooked in the squid sauce, so the calamari is still black. The calamari was good but there are probably other more interesting and tasty options on the menu. The bartender was knowledgeable about which items are gluten free and could be made gluten free. When I called ahead to make sure they had gluten free options the hostess said \"many! and I am gluten free.\"  So that was reassuring. \n\nThe restaurant is a lot smaller than I expected, so make reservations.  It would be a great date place.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Great location!\n\nThe hotel is central to everything. Nicely located In the heart of Central Business District and most of the downtown attractions were walking distance:\n\n15 miles - Louis Armstrong N.O. International Airport\n11 miles - Ultimate Swamp Adventures \n0.9 mile - Superdome \/ Arena\n0.9 mile - Bourbon Street\n0.6 mile - French Quarter\n0.4 mile - The Shops at Canal Place \n0.2 mile - Harrah's New Orleans (literally just across the street)\n\nYou get the idea. This upscale hotel has a nice front lobby section with plenty of lounge chairs near the bar area and in-house restaurant. The front entrance is gated (NOLA is big on these fancy iron gates) with tables out front, there is a separate huge side door that leads to the valet area. Service from the front staff were friendly and helpful.\n\nTo get to the rooms you need to swipe your key at the sensor inside the elevator then press the button to your floor. We were on the 18th floor and it overlooked the Mississippi riverfront attractions. The room was nice and very clean with a chaise lounge chair and a flatscreen TV. We had a very comfortable King bed.  So why not 5-stars??\n\nLet me tell you about their parking. There was none except for valet service that was $45 a day! What?? Since we rolled in late (almost 1:00a) we had to learn the hard way and find a pay-to-park lot. Hubby paid $40 for some 10 hours or so on our first night. So do yourself a favor and stop circling the block... download the ParkWhiz app. Other than the parking issue everything was great!\n\nReview #1489","stars":4.0}

Additionally, when I went they gave you a custom \"dog tag\" and you followed the story of a WWII veteran during the war and after. You get to keep the \"dog tag\" and look into the story more after you leave. That is a really personal touch. \n\nI spent about 4 hours in the museum and still missed a lot. They have several people tell their story in each part of the exhibit, but I only got to listen to a handful of the stories. I am disappointed I didn't purchase the \"Beyond All Boundaries\" ticket, but I knew I wouldn't have time to watch it. It is definitely a plan for next time. I think it would be worth adding the extra day for the small fee if you have the ability to take a break and come back. \n\nParking is a bit of a nightmare, but based on location, I don't think that is much in the control of the museum.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"One thing straight. The food is VERY good! Aside from that, this place has a few things to take care of. When you advertise as a brunch spot, you know that you are going to get crowds. In fact, expect crowds on a Saturday morning. We live a few doors down from Toast and we've been excited to go for some time now. We arrived around 10:50am and placed our orders. We received our food around 11:35am. That is quite long for some breakfast, just saying. We watched not ONE but THREE tables get up and leave because their food took an immense amount of time. It seemed that two were locals and the other 4 people were tourists and on a schedule. It was very awkward to see every table looking around to see why the food takes so long. I find it incredible that THREE tables left and a manager or someone pulls aside the waitress, reprimanding her. I feel that management is the issue here, not the waitresses. How would they control the time that the food takes? \n\nAnywho, food is great but service SUCKS! If you are looking for a quick brunch, stay away. If you have time to kill, definitely try this place out!","stars":3.0}

I highly suggest vallet.  They let you get drinks and appetizers (no entrees) at top railing but not bar since they do reservation for those. The place is not organized and we watched many open seats while we waited for our table.. annoying.  We also had to send back some food for tasting bad such as the chicken liver... the food was average.

At noon they came and stated telling us that we would have to pay them cash for the difference. When I asked what difference was they put me in with their manager. He was totally hateful and rude. Told me that since the Groupon was vague he could charge me whatever he wanted technically. He hung up on me twice and told his movers to leave us. I never yelled, cussed or said anything inappropriate. He told me that the money he's making from this move wasn't worth dealing with. He said I was a terrible customer for asking questions after booking and that it's my fault I didn't ask more in the beginning. I literally cried and begged the movers not to leave us on moving day with no help and they turned their backs on me and ignored me. I was pleading with them, not being mean and they just walked away. I've never been so outraged in my life by a group of people who literally do not care!

{"text":"With almost 1200 reviews, most of which are 4 and 5 stars, City Museum hardly needs my review. My advice? DO IT. Embrace the craziness! \n\nBut here are some tips: \n*buy your tickets online ahead of time. We went on a summer weekend and the non prepurchase line was RIDICULOUS. Having bought our tickets on my phone on our walk over, we took the non existent line to the left and waltzed right past all the suckers frying in the sun. \n*also note: it costs a few dollars more for roof access--make sure its a pretty day. If it rains they shut the roof down and do not refund money. They've got a \"we give no craps\" policy for refunds. So if in doubt, call and ask if roof is open--AND RIDES ARE RUNNING. The bus was closed the day we were there. My daughter was super bummed as she'd heard all about that. \n*as soon as you get tickets there is a column marked \"pens\" Go to this area and write your phone number on your child's wristband. This way, when they inevitably get lost, they can have an employee call you. \n*speaking of getting lost--do not underestimate the wacky design of this museum. Notice you were not handed a map when you arrived? That was NOT a mistake--they don't have them. The point is to EXPLORE and find all the hidden treasures. It's a bit frustrating at times, but if you know that beforehand you are able to plan accordingly. Pick a meeting place close to each level (the levels frequently blend into each other--a tunnel leads to a slide that leads to a different floor, etc) Have check in places and times. I kept my kids buddied up, had them check in every 20 minutes or so, and we had a back up emergency location if they got truly lost. I was nervous, but this system worked fine. \n*WEAR PANTS. You are going to be crawling on your knees, so unless you love rug or concrete burn, pants are key. The slides are also slippery enough that if you are wearing shorts they may ride up your butt. I saw it happen. It's not pretty. \n*along the dress code line--do NOT wear flip flops. This is a comfy tennis shoe place. If you lose a flip flop in here you will be that pathetic person who wanders around with one shoe. Also shoes ARE REQUIRED. No shoes=no fun. I didn't see employees enforcing very many rules, but that was one I did witness. It makes sense--floors are uneven at times, and there are many different walking surfaces. \n*And it's not dress code per sae, but I saw many WISE people wearing knee pads and head lamps (or carrying flashlights) The knee pads are self explanatory. The head lamps are for the lower darker cave regions. You seriously can get lost there and it is DARK. Also when we go again I plan to put my kids in bright fluorescent colors! \n*expect to be there with a million other people. It's that cool. But not ACTUALLY cool, as in temperature. With 8,000 bodies inside it gets warm in certain areas. Expect to sweat. I wisely choose as many of my check in places as possible to be right under a hard working air duct. \n*you are probably going to want to photograph this amazing journey--#instacool! But remember, crawling through tight tunnels with a heavy, cumbersome DSLR is no ones idea of fun. I felt like I was lugging around a 10 pound baby. Cell phones are great, but in dim lighting you probably won't get fantastic shots. If I'd thought it through I would have brought a lighter weight GoPro or similar style. \n*Its best to plan this as your ONE ACTIVITY for the day. No matter how long you stay, your kids will beg to stay longer. Everyone will be EXHAUSTED when you finish. On the Saturday we visited, the museum was open until MIDNIGHT. You can also come and go...just keep your wristband on to return. We went early in the morning, then left during the heat of the day for a quieter lunch off site (and some serious adult refreshments\/liquid courage), then returned for more afternoon fun. There are restaurants and a bar on site, but we found we needed a little break to calm our overstimulated senses!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"My timing was unfortunate because I approached Downtown Antiques just as a passing train blared its horn.  It was painfully loud as Downtown Antiques is a foot away from the tracks and surprising enough to make me jump.  For this reason, I must imagine it is an obnoxious place to work, but it is a glorious place to shop.\n\nI haven't had such a successful antiques shopping trip in Nashville in a long time (possibly ever).  Downtown Antiques is large and packed with a large variety of antiques in quality condition from postcards to dining tables (though there definitely seems to be a focus on furniture).  I even saw an old Catholic confessional for sale!  A decorating dream of mine is to someday have a dining set composed of mismatched vintage chairs, and I could have decked out half the table in just one booth at Downtown Antiques.  I found treasure around every corner.  I recommend Downtown Antiques as the first stop for anyone looking for unique home accents and decorating ideas.","stars":5.0}

Besides the great bar, restaurant, fire pits on the 4th floor deck, fitness center and indoor pool and jacuzzi - they have free bike rentals!  That is what got me hooked.  After work each day I would change clothes and borrow a bike to ride along the beautiful greenbelt.  This was truly my happy place!  I also like to ride through the Hyde Park neighborhood and catch a hike up to Camel's Back Park where there are stunning views!  Each stay at the Grove their employee Chris Ruffing took great care of me.

{"text":"The first time we went to Antica it was wonderful and we told many friends that they should go.  Tonight it was a terrible dining experience.  We had reservations for 7:00 and had to stand in a cold vestibule for 35 minutes until a table was ready.  Additionally, we were literally shoved into the vestibule by a very rude  hostess.  Parties of three and four were seated but parties of two had to wait.  We understand that booking problems happen and would not have been angry about waiting except that the two hostesses were incredibly rude.  No one apologized to us until the very end of the 35 minute wait and no one explained the situation until the end of the 35 minute wait. We have to wonder why a restaurant of this level doesn't have a bar where patrons can wait.  No one suggested that we go next door for a drink as has been suggested in other reviews.  \n\nThe problems continued - the water wasn't poured for ten minutes, and no bread was served although we were told by the waitress that it would be coming.   When we told the waitress that we were vegetarian she asked if we ate fish.  I've been a vegetarian for 30 years and wait staff used to ask that question but not any longer especially at nice restaurants.  No, I do not eat fish.  I am a vegetarian.  I don't eat meat.  Period.  We had the bruschetta as an appetizer. It was frankly just awful.  Cold slabs of bread buttered with cold whipped ricotta that had been sweetened with something that tasted like honey.  It was served with a small bowl of marinated tomatoes that were chewy and lacked any distinctive flavor.  \n\nAfter we finished our appetizers we waited about 25 minutes for our entrees.  At our first visit our waiter suggested to my companion that the kitchen could turn the eggplant appetizer into an entree with pasta to accompany it.  He requested the same dish this time and received only the appetizer which was really very small and certainly not a meal.  I had the pasta pomodoro which  we were told had a nice zing to it.  There was certainly no zing.  It bordered on tasteless.  Although there were chunks of raw garlic in the sauce.  I imagine if I had eaten one of them I could have experienced the zing.  And the pasta had not been properly prepared so it stuck together in clumps. After we finished dessert we sat with my credit card on the table. It took about fifteen minutes for the check to come to the table.  The waitress returned the credit card to my male companion even though I had handed the card directly to her.   \n\nAnd finally, the room was so over crowded that we could not hear each other talk and it was so hot (in January) that it felt difficult to breath.  We will not be going back.  Such a disappointment.","stars":1.0}

The wallpaper is peeling off and the dining areas feel used.\n\nThe menu feels like the same thing I've seen hundreds of times and the execution is even worse.  I had a burger, that's simple right?  No, it was flavorless, and totally unimaginative.  I was with a large party and saw the buffet food and I got a good look at many other dishes.  The food isn't fresh, period, it's obviously frozen and reheated.  Nothing is homemade that I can tell.  Maybe the carved brisket is the only genuine, fresh food.  \n\nOh, a waitress dropped a plate from another table down my mother's back and giggled nervously while saying \"i'm so sorry!\".  Did the manager offer a free meal?  Nope!  \n\nStay home next Friday night and have a TV dinner.  It would taste the same and cost much less.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I purchased a new 2017 Rogue Sport on June 25th which I love, but from sales to financial it was pretty bad.  They had to go get it from the Cool Springs location to fit the needs I was looking for, so I picked up my car on June 26th. My sales personal the first time I went in was Jack B(June 25th). When we were walking through the lot after driving the regular rogue I saw the rogue sport and said that's what I want. I was blown off and Jack didn't even entertain the idea. I also wanted black rims like some of the other rogues and was quoted $3955 for that on top of the price.....I could build my own rogue sport online and get rims I like for $570 I beleive.   When I went in on Sunday Jack was busy although I spoke with him on the phone and told him I would be there within an hour. Then I got Ricky who was awesome. We agreed on a car told me it was in Cool Springs. After they agreed on everything they told me the price was going to increase $1000 that it didn't have what they told it me it had.....whatever......we also threw in a window tint. Went to the financial department and they tag price increase even more, I addressed it and was told it was changed. Everything was done now I just have to wait on my car. \n\nWent home Sunday, slept on my experience and it just made me mad cause I had been their for 4 hours Sunday and 2 hours Saturday and I felt scammed.   Called the manager mutiple times....never a returned call always in meetings left a voice mail everytime with the receptionist. Even talked to Glenda there customer service manager and Ray.  So I addressed it in person and they told me they would throw in the ground lighting that they wanted to make me happy. Ray\/Jack said they would order it right away, it should be in Wednesday, they will come pick it up at my work, takes 1.5 hours to install, then they will return my car to work. Comes Friday no call.....so I left a message with receptionist. No returned call\n\nNow its July 4th, my mom was in the market for a luxury car but after riding in mine I convinced her to entertain a Nissan. Called Nissan July 4th to see if they were open, they asked why, I told them. A family matter came up and mom has put the car buying process on hold but it still is defitantly going to happen. I was honest with Nissan about what was going on. They called me twice a day about her purchasing a car. Everytime they called I told them I personally bought a car from them and still hadn't received my call about the ground lighting, they told me they would leave a message. This happened all they way up until July 10th. Still no word about my ground lighting.\n\nThen I get a survey. Which Jack B told me when I purchased my car, if I left him a good survey he would buy me a tank of gas. I was like I don't need that. The survey came in my e-mail I think about the 10th. By this point I was livid because they could call me all the time about my mom purchasing a car but couldn't return my calls about a deal they are not holding up too. I didn't feel I gave a terrible review but it definitely wasn't great. It was everything from the facility, sales, finance recommendation, and etc. How was I suppose to know how they calculate it? I get a text from Jack B (attached) on July 12. Asking for my mother's phone number, told him I would not give her number out. I asked about my ground lighting. He said Lacy would call me. Then he asked why I gave him a bad review. I thought it was good for all I went through. It wasn't great but like I said   I don't know how they calculate it. He then sends a text saying how it was a 330\/1000 and he wasn't going to get a bonus for 3 months or commission on the sell. I never responded and immediately called the manager. Two voicemails....no returned call. So I called Lacy super nice girl called me back when she said she would trying to help me resolve this. She knew nothing about ground lighting was told to call me. So today July 13, I get a call from Glenda told her everything. She said the ground lighting wasn't in my paper work, she would have to look into it. She also told me Jack was new and was frustrated at the survey.  I DON'T CARE IF SOMEONE IS NEW. WHAT IS A SURVEY FOR IF YOU ARE GOING TO SEND YOUR CUSTOMERS TEXT MESSAGES LIKE THAT, IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE ANSWERS. NOT PROFESSIONAL. \n\nStill no call. I have seen other post on here. I am sure Jason will tell me to call him but Downtown Nissan has my number, I have asked for the manager time and time again. This needs to get resolved. I was scammed beyond belief. Never got my black rims I really wanted due to being way overpriced and can't get my ground lighting apparently that they agreed to because noone wrote it down. Can't get a manager to call me back still from day one.","stars":1.0}

I'm from a part of Maryland with a fairly large Afghan community (and a ton of great Afghan restaurants), but I've tried to factor out the \"wow this is worse than what I'm used to.\" Basically, if the food cost $5 here, this place would be alright, but for $15 (dinner price for the Sansom mixed kabob), you get a few, small, dry, un-spiced kabobs on a bed of dry-ish rice with a piece of Afghan bread that is about 20% as good as it can be. \n\nI mean, it's not the worst food ever, and it's probably closer to two and a half stars, but the price (and the misleading fact that they only publish their lunch prices online and on their takeout menu, which are almost half the dinner prices) keeps it to two.

Last summer they started charging $2500 for tented cabanas by the pool when they were always free.

Extenuating circumstances - I wasn't in a place that offered pecan pie during Thanksgiving and, well, I put my pie-eating desire on hold, for the time being.

It turns out, I was just waiting to try out Pots & Pans, the famous pie shop in Broad Ripple, located next to my friend and my old watering hole: The Sinking Ship.\n\nI trekked out today, eager to get my hands on a slice of the maple pecan (only to be slightly distracted by the hot cocoa cream and the sugar cream pie, also both on my radar). I had my sights set on pecan though, and pecan it ended up being.\n\nThe store is handling COVID well - they slide your pie out to you and have a card reader set up on the table so there's no human-to-human contact\/interaction that could put you at risk. Safety? Check.\n\nI got a slice (admittedly huge for the slightly-steep $6 price tag) and drove home, eager to try it out. I ate most of it cold, warming up a little bit at the recommendation of a fellow Indianapolis foodie and let me tell you, both ways of consuming the pie were a true success. \n\nI'm eager to go back and try some of the savory options as well!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I just don't want to write a bad review, but after talking with Stephanie this afternoon and getting no resolution I feel it's worth it. No need to name call, just the facts of what happened. I ordered 3 round cakes for a baby shower. All vanilla cakes with vanilla buttercream icing. One was a naked cake. It was supposed to be simple with slight scalloped edges on top. It was a disaster and looked so unprofessional everyone who has seen it couldn't believe that I paid money for it. We were going to stick the naked cake on top of another round, however all the round cakes came with a ring of buttercream roses on top. I was never told that there would be roses. Apparently this is their standard, but no one mentioned it to me, so how would I know it would be on there? Also when I stacked the cakes, the naked cake icing was a different color than the other two cakes. All the same icing, one super white and the other two were a yellow color. They tasted different and I know what the frosting should taste like since I had a sample of it before ordering. Obviously they messed up the icing on two of the cakes. Stephanie explained that they didn't know I would be stacking it so it didn't seem like it would matter. All the cakes were also supposed to be on cardboard that was cut to the size of the bottom of the cakes. Stephanie and I spoke about this on the phone and I emailed her a confirmation that this would be done. Naturally, they weren't cut so they stood out terribly on our cake base. Plus we had to take the naked cake off of its cardboard base so we could stack it, which was just annoying and unnecessary. Also the cakes were dry. It was just so disappointing all around. I really wanted to like this bakery, but for how many things they got wrong and then to not give me a refund considering the issues were their fault, I'm astounded.","stars":1.0}

But, it's been awhile, and today was such a disappointment.  We asked to sit outside in smoking and were shown to Hemingway's cafe area.  Disgusting!  Made us feel worse for asking for 'smoking'!! Dirty tabletops and seating with small, extremely uncomfortable metal, backless stools, while the rest of the outdoor diners enjoyed lovely tables and comfortable chairs!  I do give cudos to the young man who served us!   Pleasant, efficient and knowledgeable.\nNow, about the food.....loved the complimentary pineapple 'salsa' and crispy chips!  (Something new).  The fish dip was good not great, but the tortilla chips served with it were flavorless.  Our meals, which were ample in size, included the grouper rueben...flat and flavorless, a grilled grouper sandwich which was OK.  Both at MKT pricing! (No pricing on the menu). The 'steak' fries that accompanied both tasted like frozen cardboard.  The tropical slaw tasted like it always has...good!  \nThe 'new' front entry was attractive, but, given our experience today, I doubt we'll make the trek anytime soon.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I absolutely adore Cajun\/Creole cuisine! Being that my Dad is from Louisiana, I am an absolute fanatic when it comes to anything prepared with andouille or seafood In it! I'd had my eye on this place for some time now being that there aren't many restaurants in the area offering this type of cuisine. The weather in STL was amazing on yesterday, so I decided to treat my Mom to brunch. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the hostess who was kind enough to ask if we preferred to sit near or away from the music (live band). Once we were seated, our server (can't remember his name) presented us with water while we browsed the menu. My Mom chose the pork chop entree while I opted for biscuits with andouille gravy house potatoes and an egg (potatoes and egg were ala cart). While listening to the band and checking out the smooth dance moves of a few patrons, we admired the atmosphere. Nothing fancy but overall the place was nicely set up with decorative decor throughout. After a short time our waiter presented our meals. Everything looked amazing. Now it's time for a taste test! The pork chop was well seasoned, tender and grilled perfectly.  The biscuits and gravy were delightful. My mom kindly asked for a side of gravy (she's a huge fan of biscuits and gravy - Extra $4 for a side of gravy) The potatoes were decent. My fried egg. Not so much. I asked for a fried egg with the yolk fully cooked. I'm not sure what happened but it was barely edible. The edges, bottom and the yolk were way over cooked. As we finished up our meals we looked for our waiter who was MIA for quite sometime. Maybe he took a quick break as the restaurant was quite full. Nevertheless, he finally reappeared and we asked for the check and a to go container. Overall, I was not that impressed with brunch. I spent approximately $43 (not including the tip) and can honestly say that I've had many more options elsewhere for way less. In closing, I will definitely try this place again simply because I am a fan of this type of food and I believe in second chances.","stars":3.0}

Once a server finally paid attention to me at the front door, she was pretty friendly, but I still had to drive the experience (asking for a menu, getting a burdened response when asking a menu clarification, having to ask again for a wine list whilst waiting for my take out order)...  The good and the bad of very young restauranteurs -- creativity with the food, yet shoddy, unsure service.  Will try again on account of the quality of the food and it being new and all.\n\nBad news:\nI'm gonna not exaggerate here... On a Monday night with a half-full restaurant it took 40 minutes for me to get ONE BURGER TO GO.  Seriously not exaggerating. Was never offered water.  Had to ask for my check... Felt kinda bummed as I just popped in to grab a burger.  I have to admit the burger was great. The fries were mediocre (soggy -- yes I busted into them before I left the restaurant!)\n\nGo if you have time time time to spend, but not if you need a quick and efficient bite.\n\n Also SB loooooves it's novelty so this place will be hot for a minute at least.

{"text":"Well, I am willing to give it one more shot. I want to give the benefit of the doubt as this place is new and hopefully working the kinks out.\n\nWent here with my husband to check out the new  spot in the neighborhood. A lot of opportunities  presented themselves on our visit. A bartender came up immediately with menus (yay) and she seemed pretty friendly. She came back around no 40 seconds later, \"Ready to order!?\" -- we politely told her we needed more time...she huffed and rolled her eyes. Pardon us for needing a hot second. \n\n15 minutes later a male bartender asked if we were ready...yes, yes we were. The menu stated 12 wings for $12.00. I ordered the wings and my husband ordered the burger with dipping sauce. We each ordered a beer...the first two we tried to order were not available. The drink list itself is VERY pricey for cocktails or for ordering  bourbons neat. We are not in Center City, San Francisco, or Manhattan. We are at a neighborhood bar. I know what a neat bourbon should cost or what a Titos & tonic should cost. This is a HUGE miss for me. \n\nAnyway, the food arrives. My husband did enjoy the burger with dipping sauce. He said would order it again. The wings were great -- BUT there were only 8 wings NOT the 12 listed on the menu. The male bartender never came back to check on us. By the time we were done we had to flag him down for the check...I couldn't even tell him I was missing 4 wings. When we finally got his attention he behaved like the female bartender, very huffy and a lot of eye rolling.\n\nWhat really kills me is that I reached out to the restaurant on Instagram to let them know about the wings (in a polite way) and my comment was DELETED. \n\nAs I said...I will give this one more try. Opportunities include a staff that at least seems like they enjoy their job, get the menu portions and pricing correct, and lower the price of your drinks. I will reiterate -- this is a neighborhood spot, please price it like one.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"MOST INCOMPETENT MANAGERS I'VE EVER SEEN. THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS.\n\nI've had issues with management for the last few years, as new, younger people with little people skills have taken over. We have been long-time tenants, but they treat us with no respect what-so-ever. Last year we had an issue with parking, as we waiting months for one spot and then requested it in writing as soon as it opened (there was a reason it needed to be that spot). They accidentally assigned it to a new resident and instead of simply calling that person and letting them know the mistake and reassigning them, the management put me through 2 weeks of back and forth, almost towed my car, and then called me a liar re: ever requesting it in the first place...until I resent the original request. \n\nMore recently, they power washed the patios. Our patio has a broken drain so we showed them the water would deposit straight to the basement. The WONDERFUL maintenance guy, Ricky, stopped it that morning (or so we all thought). We got home that night and they proceeded, which flooded our storage unit in the basement. My childhood memories, diplomas, medical mattress ... so many things ruined. We stayed up until 4am furiously unloading the unit and getting the items out of the wet boxes. It took through the weekend to finish relocating our things. \n\nI contacting management immediately and got the same guy from the parking situation. Not only did he not apologize, he could have cared less. I told him our insurance was likely not covering this, as it's negligence, and he initially tried to blame the maintenance guy until I let him know I already knew that was untrue. He said he'd call back to let me know how to proceed and never heard back. I reached out 5 days later and his response was \"it's the power wash company who washed the building.\"","stars":1.0}

{"text":"BJ's is like an upscale sports bar that brews their own brands of several types of draft beer. The dinning area is pretty much one large room where you can watch the large TV screens from pretty much any seat in the house. The food is not typical bar food. The flat bread pizza's are unique and solid. The Nutty Brewnette is a tasty draft ale. And I'd recommend capping your meal off with a pizookie for your kid (and yourself!). I've been there about 10 times and don't ever recall having a terrible service experience. Nothing extraordinary but nothing so bad that I never wanted to come back. \nI want to give this place 5 stars but the reality is that I stay away from it because of the crowd. It's located in a shopping mall that has a 20+ movie theater across the parking lot. Because of the varying movie times, it feels like it's ALWAYS crowded there. They have plenty of seating but the demand is so high, I think the area could support another one easy. The parking lot is small, so if you're going during peek hours, I'd recommend not even bothering with the lot around the building. Just park in the shopping mall lot and walk over to save yourself the hassle. Another tip that I'm reluctant to share.. there's plenty of \"in the bar\" seating and it's comfortable too. Keep an eye out for someone leaving a hop on that table! \nYes, it's a chain but they have a good business model. Don't be a snob go there and slurp down a brew!","stars":4.0}

Workers did not finish blowing the insulation before it got dark and needed to return; actually, they said they finished but it was a very poor quality job and a call was made to Curt requesting them to return. We paid them that evening - our mistake, lesson learned. It was running into the holidays (Dec) and after repeated calls and requests to return, they didn't do so until March because we were told they needed to align us with another insulation job to share the machine. Really? They did not tarp anything in our garage, or suggest we do so, and insulation particles got everywhere. We spent days cleaning out our garage from the mess they left behind. When the workers returned in March to finish the job, the young man told us \"I didn't know what I was doing last time\" which was appalling. Still unhappy with \"fixed\" job. Curt seemed polished and nice but was neither apologetic nor offered any compensation. Very upset we spent a lot of money with them.

{"text":"I like this store. I really do. They have interesting, fun things -- things you don't necessarily see in other stores -- and they're purporting to do something great for global economies and supporting artisans in 3rd world countries. However, after traveling through 3rd world countries and seeing some of the same items in these stores for so much more than you would ever pay abroad, I find it nearly impossible to purchase anything here at this point. For example, after going to South America I stopped into this store and saw an alpaca pullover for $400!!!! That same item would cost maybe $20 in South America, probably less if you're a great negotiator. I understand that there are import fees, travel fees, and other overhead costs involved in running a business -- no, really, I do -- but I feel as though this store tries to make it sound as if so much more money goes to the artisan, when, in fact, I don't think that's true. \n\nSo while I'm happy that this store (chain, really) keeps people fed, clothed, and housed in developing nations, I'm not sure their marketing practices aren't without deception. And, yes, I understand that livable wages vary from region to region, so what the artisans actually receive may be a \"fair\" wage where they live, but the wage they're receiving hardly renders them much above poverty. Meanwhile, this chain is pocketing a hefty sum (see example above) for those artisans' wares.\n\nI'll continue to stop in from time to time, but I'm more likely to stimulate other economies by actually visiting the countries and buying directly from the artisans.","stars":3.0}

But now that I know where it is, I won't be confused again if I just remember it's across from CarMax and at the back of the parking lot.\n\nThere were only two other people in the waiting room when I showed up for my appointment. I got checked in and although the woman checking me didn't seem entirely thrilled to be working that day, she wasn't rude to me. As soon as I was checked in, the nurse came for me. \n\nShe didn't seem like she was happy to be there either. And after the customary height, weight, and blood pressure checks, she asked what I was in for. That's one thing that has always bothered me about Renown in general - I put it in the appointment request that I made online so you already know why I'm here... Anyway, I told her it was for a physical (I need one every year for my work's wellness plan). She seemed really confused by this. Are physicals not normal anymore? So, after some drawn out questions that all began with \"Sooooo.....\" she finally asked if I had lab results to go over. Yes, I do. And that apparently answered her question. Geez. \n\nDr. Nork was in shortly after the nurse left and she didn't rush at all. You can take your sweet time and ask all the questions you need to or bring up any concerns that you have.

I booked our room at The Nugget because they had a GREAT special for those attending the race; $69 a night, 2 Free tickets to the Race and $20\/person in Free Play. They were basically paying us to stay there. Mind you I know the trick is to get you in the door so you spend your money at their restaurants and their slot machines. We were excited to try a new Casino knowing that The Nugget was under new management.\n\nOur check-in was HORRIBLE!! We waited at least a half hour to get to the front of the line. Then check-in was seemingly easy until I asked where our tickets for the evenings race was (I booked a special package). The Agent told me I had to pick them up at Will Call. So I go get in line at Will Call. There was a pair of older women at the counter looking to get show tickets. They were looking at seating arrangements trying to decide on a place to sit. They literally picked about 4 different places before settling on a seat. Then they had to pick a room, I guess they were getting a package deal. While this is taking more than 20+ minutes I'm getting impatient. NOT once did the TWO people (Kellie and Dana) helping the women look up and acknowledge that I was standing there. They also didn't help these women make up their mind, they kept giving the women more options which just made them even more confused on what they should get. I had had enough, I was hungry, my husband was annoyed, I was pissed. I just needed to pick up tickets which would have taken a minute at the most. So I interrupted them, asked Kellie & Dana if 1 of them could help me. Kellie (the trainer) told me that she was training the other (Dana) and that she'd be with me in a minute (yeah right!). Finally the older women said that they could help us because they hadn't decided yet. After I told Kellie & Dana that I got the Lucas Oil Off Road Hotel\/Ticket package Kellie began to argue with me telling me that I should have received the tickets at check-in. I told her that I didn't and that I was instructed to come to Will Call to pick them up. Kellie continued to argue with me about it instead of going and looking for my tickets. Well while Kellie was arguing with me Dana disappeared and walked back with my Tickets....Imagine that!! Someone actually did their job in CUSTOMER SERIVCE. This whole ordeal could have been avoided by 1) The Front Desk Staff being properly trained on the current Hotel Packages. 2) The Employees shut up and not argue with Guests.\n\nOur whole stay wasn't bad. The room was beautifully and sophisticatedly updated. We had an early dinner at Rosie's and our Waitress Alma was the first person to actually smile at us. She was very pleasant. We enjoyed the race and got back to the Casino at 11pm. Went to the players club to redeem our free play and the women working there was also very nice and pleasant. We enjoyed the casino floor until 1am. Slept well and had an easy check-out.\n\nWe probably will not stay at The Nugget for a while or at least until all the updates are done to the Casino. Maybe by then they will have trained their Front Desk staff better.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"My office building is part of Fooda - basically a service that brings in a series of rotating restaurants to serve lunch in the lobby.  Today Deke's was one of those restaurants. \n\nI have a sad but true story here - We were regulars at The Ugly Moose before it closed.  And we could always smell how wonderful everything cooking at Deke's was, but we never made time to go.  And then the main location closed.  We don't live in the area anymore, so we have simply never picked up their food. \n\nNow, I didn't have high hopes going downstairs today, after all, how good can any restaurant's food be when it is coming out of a buffet server?  Well, aside from needing heating up, just a bit, my sandwich today was on point. \n\nI went rogue and didn't get BBQ - instead I tried the Skinny Minny.  The combination of grilled vegetables, smoked tomatoes, goat cheese & honey served on a perfect roll?  It was great.  I'm fully satisfied (with no meat!) and the flavors were great.  I did add some sauce on the side (which I mainly dipped my chips in), but other than that this sandwich stood alone.  I made it a meal with their homemade chips - the seasonings were great- and cole slaw - unique and pretty darn good (and I'm not a cole slaw fan in general).  \n\nGiven this experience, I'm going to make time to drive by Deke's and hopefully they'll get a new location up soon!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"The smoothie and drink choices here looked delicious! (Though I didn't order any, I wanted to save room for food lol). My roommate and I ordered: Shanghai juicy bun, Peking duck roll, and roasted duck with rice and vegetables . I'll review in order of my favorites:\n\nPeking duck roll: a little pricey at $3.50, but as a person who lives Peking duck, but didn't want to spend $21 for it, this is a great 2nd option lol! It was so good and it comes out within a minute or two :)\n\nRoasted duck with rice and veggies: HIGHLY recommend. I'm not really a duck person, but I decided to try what the restaurant was known for, and it was delicious! Crispy skin, and more meat than I had in other places\n\nJuicy buns: it was okay, the sauce accompanying it was good, but there was not much soup in the buns, and I enjoyed the soup dumplings at dim sum garden way better \n\nBonus: free dessert at the end :) we got a trio of green tea, coconut, and ginger ice cream","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Over the years most repair I typically have done myself or use a neighborhood friend mechanic for the big jobs.  When last year I began having drive system problems I tried this AAMCO because it was close to work.  Initially they could not detect the problem so there was no charge.\n     In a return visit they diagnosed the problem as a driveline and repaired it quickly at significantly below dealer cost.  6 months later the problem returned.  They found the front differential was failing and could not determine if the previous bad driveline caused the differential problem or if the differential caused the driveline.  \n    Due to the age of the vehicle they proposed a used differential and covered another NEW DRIVELINE ON THEM, because possibly they missed it being caused by the differential.  When the parts jobber shipped a higher cost refurbished differential instead of the one ordered, THEY MADE THE PARTS JOBBER HONOR THE ORIGINAL PRICE.\n     Rarely do you find chain stores with such high quality and ethics.  A recent bad experience with an dealership repair has made me choose to take all non warranty car repair to this AAMCO.\n    I fully recommend them for high quality, speed and economical repair.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Great dinner here.  My boyfriend was a big fan of the humus that was served with flat bread here.  I enjoyed it although I like more garlic, tahini, and olive oil in my  humus.  This humus was more chunky and made with red peppers and no tahini \n\nWe started with the snapping shrimp and a dozen raw oysters as an appetizer.  The snapping shrimp was very tasty with a sweet and slightly spicy glaze on top.  The oysters were great and this place had a special melon\/pepper dip that was unusual, but complimented the oysters really well.  I have never had anything except cocktail sauce, lemon and crackers with oysters, but this unusual sauce was great.  \n\nAfter the appetizers salads were included in our meals.  The dressing was called a vinaigrette, but I would not agree with that description.  This was more of a smoky ranch dressing.  Despite of a misleading name, I loved this dressing.  \n\nFor an entree, I had the special that night which was wahoo crusted with walnuts and panko bead crumbs.  This was served on top of a bed of rocket (more commonly known as arugula, I can never figure out why it is sometimes called rocket).  My boyfriend had the stuffed grouper.  I think I liked his slightly better than mine (mainly because mine was likely more healthful).  The grouper and the champagne cream sauce was wonderful.  And the potato puff pasty was awesome, I would compare it to potatoes au gratin with a puff pastry on top.   \n\nOur waitress was very well informed about the menu and seemed generally excited about the food.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"My name is Amy Diamond and I moved here from Edmond, Oklahoma recently to start a new life. I am a gym rat, and I'm in the gym 7 days a week, so a good gym is super important to me. I tried several gyms in the area the first few days I was here, and had a terrible experience at all of them. Either dirty, poorly maintained machines, or rude, pushy salesman trying to get you to sign your life away. My friend in the area recommend I try LA Fitness. We decided to go to the new one in Seminole and I received a pass to try it out and loved it. Everyone was extremely nice and genuine and friendly. I met a great sales guy named Jay who showed us around and was very knowledgeable, non-pushy, and extremely kind. I wanted to sign up that day, but hadn't gotten a job yet, so I decided it was best to wait till I had a job before signing up. Theresa, the General Manager there, was the one that assisted us in the pricing of the club and all the details. She was super sweet, understanding, and didn't make me feel the least bit pressured. She also didn't make me feel embarrassed or bad for wanting to wait. She really took very good care of me and was very understanding of my situation. She hooked me up with a free week pass so I could try the gym out further. Gratefully, I found a job pretty quickly and was able to sign up, and Jay took great care of me in the sign up process. He was quick, effective, and thorough. I also met Rob the assistant GM, and he also was extremely kind, friendly, knowledgeable and took really good care of me. Everyone at this club made me feel extremely welcomed and wanted from the moment I walked in the door. I'm always greeted with a smile and by name. I've been to several other LA Fitnesses in the area and have not had the same experience. Theresa's club is the nicest, cleanest, friendliest LA Fitness I've ever been to, and I go out of my way most days to drive over to her club, even though I have other LA Fitnesses a lot closer. I can not speak highly enough about Theresa, Rob, Jay, the club, and everyone that is there. I would give this a higher rating then 5 stars if I could. Would highly recommend this particular LA Fitness because I know it's super clean and machines are all nice and in working order. You'll be taken great care of. For someone that moved a long way all alone to come here, I appreciate how welcomed I felt and how well they took care of me. Means a lot to an outsider, and definitely keeps me coming back every day. Wish more GM's acted like Theresa, and took such good care of people like she and Rob and Jay did. I am very grateful.","stars":5.0}

My absolute favorite was the hummus power bowl but it has been discarded from the menu! I'll stick to the mediterranean sand which! What I found odd is sometimes they would switch up the bread for that order. Some are white, some are a tinted red. With every order I accompany it with the refreshing iced green tea or green power smoothie(?) It's definitely something to crave on a hot day. The parking is such a hassle! Though not the restaurants fault of course, finding a parking spot relatively near the restaurant is a lucky find! It's a relaxing place to study indoors, wifi is provided. It could get a bit chilly inside, but they have an outdoors area as well! As for most orders they come with a 99c pastry item which is hard to pass up..

Bananas Foster was created here, so it's obvious that you have to try it.  \n\nWe made a reservation and were seated right away upon our return.  The four in our party each ordered a bananas foster dessert and a drink.  Each dessert is $10, so the bill for just dessert for four came to over $50.   Our waiter was average, but a bit snooty for my taste.  I'm sure the $50 bill was much less than he was used to serving.  \n\nWe enjoyed watching the Bananas Foster being made near our table.  It's definitely part of the experience and why you'd pay $10 for sugar and bananas.  It was delicious, too, and the coffee that was served was equally delicious.  \n\nAlthough it's a fairly dressy place, we were told that a shirt and nice jeans were acceptable attire.  When we were leaving, though, I watched as some uptight Old South woman eyed me up and down and then I heard her say something about \"jeans\" to her uptight wealthy old husband.   It made me wish I had cropdusted her with a banana fart as I walked by. \n\nI'd return to try the famous \"Breakfast at Brennan's,\" but as far as atmosphere and decor, if I was going to drop that kind of money for dinner, I'd pick Antoine's instead.","stars":4.0}

Everything here is made out of wood and it truely feels like you are out in the woods somewhere and not miles from downtown.  We came on a Sunday evening with my family who has never been here before and the service was extremely slow. If it was busy I would understand, but Big Woods was dead. The bartender was nice enough did help. We ordered pretzels sticks as an appetizer together. The appetizer was quite good. The mustard and cheese sauces tastes like they were made in house and was something I would order again. For those who do not like horseradish I would caution you to take a tiny sample of the mustard before going all out. After that the dinners were kind of rough. I ordered poutine with steak tips. The gravy was as thin as water and the cheese curds were not well melted and oozing at all. It can be hard to make a good poutine so I know the risk you run ordering it. My brother in law ordered a fried chicken sandwich and there were very simple mistakes made, like serving the sandwich with burned buns and a soppy not crispy chicken. The rest of the meals my family enjoyed. I simply wish there was more attention to detail given to the food that was served. That being said I would come here again to try other things as I have heard plenty of good things and may have just picked the wrong menu item.","stars":2.0}

I try to eat high protein and veggies with limited flour when I do eat.  This place makes that easy, with their Frittatas!  Lets be real I do not think Nashville has caught on the to the healthy food kick yet.  They are beginning stages, although it's not in full swing simply b\/c ppl indulge when they go out.  I have to watch what I eat b\/c I gain weight easily (desk job).  Running inside for either a beef or veggie Frittata has made all the difference to keep me full till dinner sometimes!  I even did a thanksgiving PRE-order of Frittas!","stars":5.0}

One is always hustling and works quite hard while the other young lady lazily assembles a few hot dogs while the line grows longer and longer.

{"text":"I won't be returning here again. \nMy 8 month old puppy was hit by a car late one night and this was the only hospital I knew of in Reno open 24 hours.\nYou have to ring a doorbell to be let in to the hospital, which I can understand from a safety standpoint, but when you're holding a 50 pound dog who has a broken leg, waiting is not an option. \nWhen I walked in, someone came in and just took my puppy from me and went into the back. Talk about a worried mom!\nThey didn't come out to talk to us for about 20 minutes, leaving me to sit in their inhospitable waiting area. When the doctor finally came out, she had us meet her in the only room they had. She told me about the multiple things that could be wrong with my dog because no one saw how she got hit. Again, she left for a long while before returning with the quote for the overnight hospitalization and treatments. It came out to $1,400, and they wanted it immediately. The doctor stood in the room with us with almost no regard for our privacy while we tried to figure out how to come up with over a thousand dollars in the middle of the night. She just stood there, staring at us, waiting for me to pull out a magic credit card that would pay for everything. She wasn't willing to work with us at all. She just wanted our money. Thankfully, I had some family help me out. We were sent home being told the doctor would call me once the lab and X-ray results would come in, which could take hours. I didn't get a call until 12:30 in the morning. This is when I found out that the facility doesn't perform orthopedic surgery anyways! And my dog's leg was broken! So now, instead of paying for just one hospital visit, I had to pay for two. I honestly just wish they would have referred me to the other 24 hour pet emergency hospital that DOES perform surgery. It would have saved a lot of driving and money. \nThis place has no remorse or empathy for your pet. They just want your money. If you have a pet emergency, I highly suggest Sierra Veterinary Specialists off of Wells.","stars":2.0}

Imagine my surprise when I realized it's been converted into a hell of a good Mexican restaurant.\n\nParking lot looked full when we walked up, but there was plenty of room inside and we were seated immediately. The standard chips and salsa came out right as we sat down. Chips were decent and the salsa was good but lacked even the slightest amount of heat. \n\nI went for the Tequila's Parrilla Fajitas ($12.99), which was arrachera steak, chicken and chorizo topped with grilled nopales, spring onions and chiles toreados. The steak was my favorite, but it was a little tough. The chicken was also pretty tasty, and the chorizo seemed like an afterthought piled on top of the chicken. Honestly, I could have done without it. Fajitas didn't come out with the normal plate of lettuce, sour cream or tomatoes, and I had to ask for a side of guacamole. \n\nI wouldn't put this on the same level as La Margarita, but if I were giving La Marg a 5, I'd give this place a 3 and all of the other standard mexican places a 1. I'll be coming back here as I'm sure they'll hit their stride, and I expect great things once they do.","stars":5.0}

That is probably one of the most randomly offensive things I can think of.\n\nAll things considered, as long as the flights are relatively on time and all that, airports don't have to be someplace you want to hang out.

My husband is north-east Asian, and he has gotten completely different treatment just being 2 feet behind me in lines  multiple times through security and boarding aircrafts.  The most extreme example was one time the TSA agents were pulling all Asians, not just brown south Asians (unfortunately expected for many post 9\/11), out for extra screening and baggage evisceration.  I walked through security right before my husband, and the same women who thanked me was yelling at me 30 seconds later when I grabbed one of our mutual bags, as my husband had already been pulled aside for his extra special treatment.  Apparently I was not allowed to touch potential terrorist material?   Like I mentioned, all Asians were getting pulled, including a Chinese mom with two very small kids.   Really?

{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I do really like their food! However, there's reasons why it's a 3 star rating in my book.\n There was a Uniboil in my hometown, but I never bothered to try it until they opened in Goleta. The uniboil back in my hometown also made it a 2 concept store with Phresh Teas as well.\n\nI've tried their Sichuan spicy broth and healthy tomato, both are solid. I personally pick beef as my meat.\nPopcorn chicken is the best in SB!! Tastes how it's supposed to be, but over priced at $7 for a basket. Esp since chicken thigh is a really cheap cut of meat! \n\nIssues with the store:\n\nMy 1st visit, I came with my boyfriend and they ran out of popcorn chicken at 5pm....we did end up trying their drinks, also known as Phresh Teas. My gripe is that they don't add enough toppings in their drinks when it's a 50 cent upcharge. There was literally only an inch sized layer of topping. I ordered a Hokkaido milk tea, 1\/2 sweet and I saw that it was powdered, so nothing special. However, even at 1\/2 sugar it was still really sweet as if it was regular sugar. It's probably because of the Hokkaido flavored powder containing sugar already. This is coming from someone who grew up in the 626 and got boba everyday after high school!\n\nMy bf got the fruit tea, which is good and what I've had before in the 626. Got lychee jelly, but was the same one inch amount inside. Personally I'd prefer chopped fruits than whole though, since it means less of the tea! The chunks are huge and you can only really eat the watermelon spear inside. It's usually lime, lemon, orange, and watermelon, but I'd suggest they mix up other fruit combos as well.\n\n2nd visit, I came with friends and there was plenty of seating. We wanted to sit in against the wall where there was a cushioned bench on one side, but we were told to wait for a table with all chairs. Took over 10 mins to set up one table even though the store wasn't even busy..\nThe girl wiped the table clean but it was still soaking wet and my friend made a remark about it and the employee just said \"oh it means it's clean!\" I felt that she didn't piece it together that she needed to grab a dry towel to wipe it...so we did end up eating at the table while it was still wet.\n\n3rd visit, I came with friends who were fans of uniboil back in Monterey Park. We ordered and one of my friends wanted the korean army stew, but substitute pork with beef. The manager said we couldn't do that, but my friend stated that the other uniboil she's a regular at are ok with it. The manager said she needed to talk to the other owners if it's allowed, but I don't see why a simple meat swap would be such a big deal. \nAnyways, she did end up giving a side of beef on the house, but the restaurant could have saved $$ by just substituting? we were confused, but at least we got extra meat?....haha\n\nAnyways, I am glad that more authentic asian businesses are coming in, and as mentioned I like their food here, but there's some stuff they can fix! \n\nI'll still visit when I have a craving~","stars":3.0}

{"text":"*update my stylist (Kiana) is no longer there so I won't be back.\n\nI have a love hate relationship with this place. One of the stylist\/managers picks and chooses what she wants to do and does not do up-dos. I booked Sandra for the Air Force ball because she was good the two times I had her. But when she didn't want to do the updo I needed and passed me off to someone else. Turns out she does this often. There has also been times when I booked another girl and without calling she switched my apts from the girl I booked for color to her. I understand the girls have things come up but to do that without calling. Anyways thank goodness for Kiana (that was the first time she was my life saver). Frankly if someone books you for an updo and you can't or won't do updos you shouldn't be in this line of work. That night I also noticed the way she treated the other stylists and even customers. I thought she was nice up until that night. I also think some of the younger stylists put up with more than They should. I was in the military and we were treated better than the way she treats them. It's easy to notice when you watch the eyes (she glared a lot and acted holier than thou) her interaction, tones, and body language said it all. Twice now I have had an apt and they were overbooked or surprise the girl I booked was MIA. They said they called but I looked and I had no missed calls and even showed the stylist my phone call history. \n\nI waited for Kiana because she's worth the wait. Online it books for 2 hours but only takes about 1 hour max for color. Bless her heart. She is super good and I hope she finds a better place to work that appreciates her along with some of the other girls. If I had to work under those conditions I would have found another place to work. Some of the girls are great but the manager  needs to get it together! Kiana 5 stars and the manager and salon manager 1 Star. I can't remember her name but there is a young stylist with dark hair and nose ring who is also good. She cut my hair once and I really like it. I keep coming back because of the few stylists I like but it's getting to the point where I can't stand how the business is run nor the way the managers treat the girls and with them not calling when there is a\nMishap. \n\n*****From what happened today and realizing I'm not the only one who was not contacted ....there were 2 other girls that came in claiming they were not contacted so I know damn well this manager and stylists didn't call and it confirmed the issues here. But yet the manager gets pissy if you can't make an apt.\n\n*I would also price check products (the ceramic brushes can be found on amazon for over $10 less and most of the products I have found a lot cheaper on amazon) and services. It's around 40-50 just for a hair cut. I paid over 200 for a color that included highlights and a trim. I think the color is worth it but a trim costs too much here.","stars":1.0}

It was either good or just good because I needed a change of pace from all the other food. Kinda fatty for my taste but still good. I expected real bacon bits on my baked potato but got dehydrated baco's. I couldn't finish the potato. It is a nice change of pace but they have work to do.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Okay, I'm writing from the perspective of someone who regularly frequents other \"Metro\" transportation, primarily Chicago and Washington D.C.  (I'm only reviewing the light rail.  I have never used the buses or shuttles).\n\nBy those standards, Metrolink is a sad and ailing relative.\n\nI agree 100% with the comment about the \"honor\" system.  Why not put in turnstyles and guarantee 100% payment by all riders.  The first time I rode Metro trains I was not aware of the \"validation\" requirement.  WTF?  How ridiculous is this system that doesn't allow you to purchase a fare card and use it over a span of time or add value?\n\nAdditionally, the 1 line (with a spur) is a joke.  Metrolink would be truly useful if a train went up to Alton, down to South County Mall to Arnold, out to West County.  \n\nWith the ineptitude, graft and overall mismanagement by the City and Metro board, you can't expect much more than we have though, so I guess it is as good as it will ever be.  It will never make a profit, so it will never expand without massive Federal investment, which would be flushing more national treasure.\n\nAll you need is one visit to D.C. or the Bay Area or Boston or Chicago or even Philly and you'll see how very narrow the Metrolink has set up their routes to prohibit large-scale ridership.  It really does serve only a small fraction of St Louis City or County's residents and is almost simply a way to get airport folks to the downtown or out to Scott AFB.\n\nTo complete my rant, I'll add--lack of public restrooms, security bordering on stoogery and recently reduced service, causing even longer waits.\n\nNo thanks...I'll drive.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I've never rated a restaurant before, but my experience at Bella\nMilano deserves a comment.\n\nIt was wonderful!\n\nMy husband made the reservation for our whole family to celebrate my\nbirthday. When we arrived, part of our party was already seated, not\nforced to wait in the lobby, and enjoying some lovely wine.\n\nWe were promptly seated, waters filled, and appetizer\/drink orders\nplaced. The appetizers ranged from some of the best fried calamari\nI've ever had (my husband and I live on The Hill and have experienced\na wide range) to a bruschetta with pesto that I would willing eat as\nmy sole food source for the rest of my life. Those were just the\nappetizers!\n\nThe Milano salad is an absolute treat. A house-made Italian-style\ndressing tossed in a bed of lettuce, cheese, and prosciutto cubes.\n\nFor the main, I had cheese tortellini.  It had a kick but it was softened by the cream--an extraordinary combination that was new to\nme. My husband had a seafood spaghetti with a lemon butter sauce. He\nreports that it was sweet, rich in flavor but did not feel heavy after\nhe ate it as most butter sauces make him feel.\n\nFor dessert, everyone has a bite or two of each others food and the\ntable agreed that the best by far was the fried cheesecake and the\nSicilian chocolate cake. The chocolate was decadent and exceptional,\nnicely offset by the raspberry pur\u00e9e. The cheesecake was on a bed of\ncreme anglaise and, to be honest, I'm getting hungry just thinking of\nit.\n\nLike I said, the experience was amazing.

This also included the DeFurminator on our lab mix. They looked and smelled great and we got a dog-free day to clean up our house! The new groomer is fantastic. You can tell he really loves his job.\n\nThe only issue (if you could even call it that) was that once we got the dogs in the car, one of the nails on our lab started to bleed. A lot. Of course this happens when the nails are ground down but The Dog Spot was awesome. We called them and brought our dog back and they put some powder on to stop the bleeding. They also gave us some peroxide to clean up our backseat and a blanket to lay down. The owner was great about the whole thing, even offering to pay to have the seat cleaned.\n\nThe peroxide did the trick and they gave us some powder to take home in case in nail bled again.

The setting almost feels right out of a PAUL or Le Pain Quotidien location found along the east coast or in a European city, but is unique for St. Louis.  The quiche, avocado toast and coffee we ordered were tasty and good sized.  Emily delivered great service, but this location remains chronically understaffed and is consistent with my previous experience here.\n\nA big problem is the signage directing diners to \"please set yourself\" which leads to many people sitting down an expecting someone will be by shortly to take their order, however this place runs with a skeleton crew. Emily and the other staff member on duty were both delightful and did their very best, but if a member of management happens to be reading this PLEASE invest in more staff.  Your guest experience is suffering as a lack of it and it is placing an undue burden on your staff juggling too many duties at a given time.

There is a fountain in one corner and we were told if we sat over there the trickling water might splash us. I can't imagine getting splashed with water in those temperatures. I had two blankets wrapped around me like a cocoon and I never fully got warm in 45 minutes. I have been to two other salt caves and it was warm and cozy in those. They dimmed the lights way down for most of the session but honestly I would've preferred them to stay on because it gave a nice glow. The music also stopped halfway through the session and so I felt strange in a dark, damp and silent room. A little too cave-y for relaxation, IMO.","stars":3.0}

They do also currently (Jan '12) offer a kids eat free night on Tuesday with paying adult.\n\nSmall, standard menu plus daily specials & sides.  Nana's does usually post a copy of the daily specials\/sides\/desserts on their facebook page if you want to know what's happening.\n\nWe live nearby and this is the kids' favorite place to eat in Nolensville.  This is likely because of the desserts.  As mentioned by other reviewers, they offer solid portions of pie, pudding or cake for low prices.  Not sure if it's all homemade or not, but all of the desserts are good.\n\nMeal portions are sensible - that is to say, not massive like you find at some other places.  That also helps keep prices low.  So you may not receive an overflowing plate of grub, but it's more than enough for most diners.\n\nMy one gripe -- they only serve breakfast on Saturday mornings.  They do open around 1030 Sunday morning but only serve the regular menu during those hours.  It would be great if they would expand breakfast options on Sunday or even as all day options - at least that's my $0.02. \n\nNolensville has several good dining options these days: Martins BBQ, Uncle Buds, Amico's Pizza, Nana's Diner, Oscar's Tacos and even Mama's Java lunch specials.

The details, lines, the look, everything is so perfect I'm still so blown away by it every time I look at it, not to mention the amount of compliments I get every time people see my tattoo. I never knew of Aart accent or Kyle before neither had I ever been to New Orleans and I can say they went above and beyond my expectations. It was so well done that two friends of mine came in for tattoos right after that.Whether you live in the city or just visiting, go there and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

You can tell them what wine you want in a certain price range, and their answers are fast and excellent.  \n\nSmall but good selection of upscale spirits, and I was able to taste a wonderful floral gin I'd never heard of before.  Good array of bubbly, and they always seem to be featuring exactly what I am looking for, like dry rose in the summer. There is a LOT chilling for you, much more than the two coolers you will see in the wine room, so just ask.

{"text":"Great feel to the newly renovated space.  We celebrated out anniversary on a Wednesday night.  Reservation process was easy and friendly with a text reminder, which was nice.  We were greeted and seated immediately.  It took a few extra minutes for anyone to come to our table to take a drink order.  Then a few more minutes for the actual  waitress to appear.  She was very friendly and knowledgeable. However, she was spread a little thin and getting two different drink orders too way too long.  When I requested wine with my entree, I was nearly done before I had to flag down the manager to assist.  Speaking of the manager, he wasn't friendly and seemed upset\/preoccupied with running the restaurant vs greeting guests.  No manager ever came to our table to check in which was very disappointing since we were excited about supporting this new local restaurant.\nThe meatloaf was excellent.  The vegetable entree was surprisingly small and overpriced.  Biscuits were fantastic.  Margarita was too sour.  Hummus was too cold and hard...I'm not sure if it's because it was black eye pea based vs chick pea.\nWe understand they've only been opened 5 weeks, so we cut them some slack.  The \"now hiring\" banner on the front of the building totally cheapened the experience...very poor first impression for an upscale restaurant.\nOverall, the ambiance was great, our waitress tried hard and was very sweet, the food was good-ish.  We spent $100 for 3 drinks, appetizer and 2 entrees.  One of the biggest disappointments was when no one, including the manager standing at the front door, thanked us for coming when we left.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I have never had a pleasant experience at the O'Fallon branch at SCU. The last time the teller in drive-thru made a huge scene, flailing her arms in the air and screaming at me, and I was mortified! I had a simple question about making a deposit and was polite the whole time. Another teller came up and answered my question in less than 10 words, simple as that. I think the first teller didn't know her stuff and had a major childish outrage! The bankers (for loans and new accounts and such) inside are hit and miss. Katie is fantastic and professional but the others I've dealt with only see you as a number and don't even make eye contact. Overall, the O'Fallon branch is highly unprofessional, impersonal, cold, rude, unethical, and makes your banking experience terrible. Do not bother with this branch, save yourself the headache! I even called the branch manager after the drive-thru experience but the hold times were WAY too long (over 45 minutes) every time I tried calling and I had to get back to work, so I wrote an e-mail and I did receive a reply that the manager would be notified.

{"text":"We have enjoyed dozens of delicious meals at Horseshoe, for special occasions as well as just because we were in the mood for their food. Sunday was my birthday and, given the present state of health affairs and our age, we wouldn't be going out to celebrate. So we opted for Horseshoe's curbside service. \n\nWhat a pleasure! It was easy to order; we called when we arrived; our food was brought out in minutes and placed in the open car trunk. Downside? The fragrance was almost too much to bear on the ride home. \n\nSo the takeout process went smoothly, but you might wonder how the food fared by the time it got home. I ordered the ribs. They were falling-off-the-bone luscious: meaty, tender, juicy, and flavorful. And there was enough that we'll be enjoying them again tonight. Our loaded baked potatoes were perfectly roasted and expertly topped. The jalape\u00f1o corn muffins are complimentary when dining in, so we wanted (needed?) to order them separately.  At $1.99 for an order of those darling little muffins, it was totally worth it. Pretzel rolls were also part of the package, and we split one to try it. Really good, but we had so much food that we are saving them for sliders later this week. \n\nSince it was for a birthday, we had to have the best dessert in town: the s'mores skillet. The takeout version came in a foil pan instead of cast iron, but was as phenomenal as when dining inside the restaurant. Someone had thoughtfully written a note with heating directions, so when ready, we popped it in the oven for ten minutes at 350, poured on the cup of chocolate, sprinkled the graham crumbs, and dumped the container of vanilla ice cream on top. Can a dessert be vulgarly decadent? This one is - in such a good way. \n\n\n\n\nWe eagerly anticipated Horseshoe's prime rib for our anniversary, and both food and service leaped to meet our expectations. Our server was attentive but unobtrusive, just as he should be. He brought warm jalape\u00f1o corn muffins and ice water with our cocktails, likely the best bloody Marys in town: with a kick but not too spicy, olives and pickled onions on a pick, salt-spiced rim, and a crunchy piece of bacon. The loaded potatoes were perfectly cooked, soft and creamy inside. The beef was tender, flavorful, and absolutely succulent, not to mention the biggest 8-ounce serving I've ever seen. The salad bar was stocked with a lovely variety of romaine and spring mix, fresh veggies, olives, chick peas, beets, and a selection of house-made dressings. We always go for the blue cheese with good reason.  We might have ordered the incredible s'mores skillet, but, thankfully, we were too full.","stars":5.0}

The meat is high quality - chicken is never frozen and hormone-free. And the cheese....mmmmmm!!!! They make sure its all melty amazing and the whole sandwich, therefore, is just glorious! My husband got the regular cheesesteak and loved it just as much. The only \"negative\" is that my hubbs likes to add mushrooms and it was an extra $1 to add mushrooms. Seems a bit steep. But with how amazing everything tasted, you forget about the price (which is still relatively low overall). We will for sure be back!\nAlso - I noticed some reviews remark that the place is \"dirty.\" I did NOT find that to be the case!? The whole place, while dated-looking, was very tidy and clean.

Pasta dishes are flavorless and none of the entrees stand out.  Dessert (tiramisu) was the one really good thing we ate here.  For this price, there are so many better places to go just within a few blocks.  For example, the amatriciana pasta at La Viola is much better and more flavorful but a lot cheaper.  If you're going to splurge on a $25-30 entree, there are many other nice restaurants to choose from.   \n\nTowards the end of the meal, our waiter began circling our table like a vulture.  Right after we signed the check he explicitly asked us if we could leave because another party was coming in, even though we were still finishing our wine.  Other groups had lingered much longer than us without being disturbed (but I suspect those groups had not yet signed off on the tip).  A couple minutes later, he started pushing our table together with another table (while we were still sitting in it!) to make room for the other group.  Again, I wouldn't complain about this service at a restaurant that charges $15 \/ plate but I think it is outrageous to be treated like this after paying $16\/ $25\/ $8 for an appetizer, entree and dessert!   The hostess was nice, but just try not to get this imbecile of a waiter with long-ish dark hair and an accent who serves the window tables on Friday nights.","stars":2.0}

All I know is that it was an enjoyable dining experience thanks to a well balanced menu, nice wine by the glass selection made up of primarily local wines and good service. Atmosphere is sort of an upscale fishing shack.\n\nI had the seared ahi spinach salad and my wife the grilled salmon salad for lunch. The kids split a grilled salmon over rice and veggies. Everything was light and fresh.\n\nAs they are now owned by the Shellfish folks, I assume it will still be good next time around.

Finally making it to the soda station (they have Ski BTW) I saw some openings, and started to chill.  Could have been the cold soda, but I was definitely chilled at this point.  Stepping up to the chow line I went with pulled pork.  How could I not, it had a good smoke ring, a little bark, and was glistening.  Got my sides, fries and slaw (I really wanted to put the slaw on the pork sandwich, but thought my coworkers would think I was being pretentious.  \n\nFinally I am at the table with my tray, and its time to chow.  I went with the coffee BBQ sauce.  It was good, not the best I have ever had, but good none the less.  The sandwich was outstanding, juicy, and flavorful.  I am really just so ecstatic that they have pulled pork, and not pork cubes like the local BBQ chain here in STL.  Wait a minute... what the hell is that over there.  My colleague... his sandwich...  its like a big mac, but its brisket.  What the hey?  I typically do not run an interference when someone is enjoying their own plate but I had to ask him about his sandwich.  It was thick chunks of brisket on a bun and it looked like a BBQ big mac IMO.  He loved it, I forgot the name of the sandwich, but its apparently their signature item.\n\nAll in all it was a great experience, and I am very happy that there is some good BBQ close to the office.  If you work in Westport you can definitely make it to SF's and back in an hour.  Go early, or after the rush though.

They were very busy, so I ended up being there just over three hours without even donating.  They infiltrated the vein in my right arm and, because of how long I had been there, decided to just give the whole blood back so I could donate in a couple days.  Problem was my phlebotomist forgot to take out the saline, so when the machine attempted to pump that into the vein on my left arm, it caused a rupture and bled.  \n\nI was patient- mistakes happen- but as a result of the bruising this caused, I was not allowed to donate for 14 days.  I talked to Brenda at the Boise office on Eagle to see if my promotional period would be adjusted, and was told it wouldn't.  I explained what had happened - that it was a result of a mistake on their end - and was told too bad.  Thanks Brenda.\n\nIn conclusion, you get here what I've come to expect.

Sadly, I think what makes this place so attractive is that it's the only Filipino restaurant in the city.\n\nWe opted for the \"buffet sampler\", which at $5.99 is a great way to try out a variety of dishes. I enjoyed the bicol express, which is a spicy pork and coconut green curry similar to the Thai version. Less impressive was the lechon paksiw, which was somewhat tough and brutally fatty; the sweetness of the dish also overpowered the minute vinegary taste in the meat. The kare kare, which I was looking forward to the most, was a big miss. It would have been incredibly bland had it not been for the serving of shrimp paste on the side, which we both used liberally.\n\nMost disappointing was the lumpia. We ordered the savoury kind for the table and for $5 we received eight finger-sized pieces that were very meh. I also ordered the dessert lumpia turon to go, and found it to be okay. I'm not sure if I've been spoiled by my friends' homemade lumpia, but both versions did not live up to our expectations.\n\nThe redeeming quality about this place is the staff, who were incredibly friendly and kept checking on us to make sure we were enjoying the food.

{"text":"Ever had a barbecued sushi roll? If not, I highly recommend the Kiss of Fire roll for your first experience. \n\nNot found on the menu and offered as an occasional special (however you can request it at any time) this is a shrimp tempura roll, wrapped up and topped with avocado, unagi, spicy tuna and tobiko, and drizzled in sweet sauces. \n\nThe entire roll is wrapped up in foil, doused in Bicardi 151 and lit at the table presenting a smoky, crispy, \"sushi-bbq.\" The taste of this roll and the smokiness is not only unique but it lingers. Other roles pale in comparison to this roll. Get this roll as the grand finale.\n\nWe also ordered a North Shore roll with mango that had some of the freshest fish around. The fancier rolls run about $15 and sizeable enough to share. \n\nThe most surprising part was that this place is literally in the middle of nowhere (no offense to residents) and it has all the makings of a fancier sushi restaurant in any urban area, yet it is found in the outer burbs of Philly in a small strip mall with a tiny and scary parking lot. The service was fast and friendly and they even ended the meal with complimentary pineapple slices and fried bananas. \n\nNext time I am in Philly I will definitely go out of my way to come here for that sushi bbq roll!!","stars":4.0}

I am a trans female and even though I was dressed pretty and had long hair, make-up and jewelry on, the bartender insisted on calling me \"sir\".

So when I didn't tip him for the second round, he made it a point to loudly exclaim: \"Oh, exact change! That's just perfect!\"  We left because it was clear that the bar--or at least that bartender (overweight white mail with short ponytail)--was not LGBT friendly.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"The stadium is nice.  The neighborhood is terrible. \n\nIt's a relatively small stadium with about 18,000 seats.  I'll be interested to see the longevity of the fan-base as the novelty of the stadium and a new team wears off, but so far, they have been doing quite well in attendance and fan enthusiasm at the games is great.\n\nThe actual venue for watching the event is excellent.  Many of the seats have views of the river and most seats seem to provide good views of the field.  The stadium also always seems clean and well maintained.  \n\nThe downside to the stadium is that the concourse areas seem too small (specifically too narrow) for the amount of people in the stadium.  It's almost as if the designers of the stadium viewed the stadium more as a baseball\/football stadium than a soccer stadium.  This is because, unlike baseball, where people head out to bathrooms\/concessions after each half inning, halftime is generally the only time fans leave their seats.  This means that at half-time the lines for concessions are very long and the concourse areas are extremely crowded.  I'm not sure if there is anything you can do to prevent the mad rush at halftime, but they could have widened the concourse to allow for the mass of people that migrate there during halftime. \n\nThe parking situation has also deservedly received some negative comments.  Like some of the design of the stadium the parking was not well thought out.  The location of the stadium is in, literally, one of the worst neighborhoods in Pennsylvania.  The riverfront area understanding as a result has plenty of undeveloped area.  Unfortunately, the building of the stadium either did not account of the necessary amount of parking nearby or thought they were going to get more people commuting to the games via train.  Either way, many lots are offsite and require a shuttle bus ride.  Not a huge deal, but certainly not a great situation.  Leaving the main parking lot also gets very backed up as there are limited exits. \n\nDriving access to the stadium isn't great either.  They are currently constructing an off ramp that would allow for reasonable access that doesn't require a trip through the ghetto.  \n\nOverall its a fun place to visit.  I think some of the elements about the stadium and surrounding area were poorly planned, and I'm not a believer that the Chester Waterfront is ever going to be what they want it to be, so I doubt some of the issues about the stadium...specifically parking will ever be addressed.  However, the crowds are great and it's a great way to spend an afternoon or evening.\n\n\nTip: In order to blend in, when the union score, just start singing \"Doop\" you will receive automatic street cred and be offered protection from opposing fans by the Union's devoted fans called the Son's of Ben.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"She is awesome!!! And for many good reasons. \n\nFirst, she trimmed my hair perfectly. She paid full attention to what she was doing and took into consideration all of my preferences. I've had many people who've cut my hair pretend they cared about what they were doing, but didn't actually focus, thus leading to an awful hairstyle. I loved her input in what she thought would also make my hair look even better. The end result was absolutely beautiful. \nSecond, she was incredibly easy to talk to. It felt like I was talking to one of my aunt's, and I just met her.\nThird, and probably one of the most unique, she's letting me pay her back later. After she cut my hair and was about to take my credit card for payment, she realized she no longer had her credit card app. Together, like aunt and niece, we went around Chinatown looking for a working ATM. But to not avail, we still couldn't find an ATM that took my credit card. And as sweet as she was, she told me to not worry about it and to come back again whenever I get the chance to pay her back.

{"text":"I am local and will NEVER step foot in the GSR again after DECADES of patronage. They simply DO NOT CARE.\n\nI've been visiting this place off & on since 1991 (remember Bally's?) but they've now lost me as a customer. They keeping trying to reinvent themselves - their bars, clubs & restaurants are constantly being revamped & renamed because they are so terrible. It is so bad that I really do wonder if this place is simply a tax write-off to its owner(s) - that would explain a lot.\n\nToday was the last straw for me. My husband has literally had to talk me into going to their buffet (forget the New name) the last 3 times I've gone due to their consistently dry, old, overcook, bland food. My hubby SWORE to me that things had changed over there, so we went.\n\nWe arrived at roughly 10:15am. I did not see ONE food item that looked appealing or IN ANY WAY fresh - most items were OBVIOUSLY dried out and old (rice, sausage, quiche - everything). Not even the bacon looked appealing - even cheap bacon doesn't deserve the abuse it gets here. It's REALLY hard to ruin bacon for me, but this was one step above charcoal & somehow all stuck together in clumps of 3 or more pieces (like they were pressed together while being cooked well beyond crispy).\n\nANYWAY, I got my hungry 4 year old a clump of bacon, a dried waffle & a chewy pancake - then accidentally drenched it because the syrup was so watered down. I didn't get anything for myself, not from a lack of being hungry, but because I wasn't hungry ENOUGH to eat anything they had.\nAfter several disappointing trips there I finally decided to speak up (how would they know how bad it is if no one complains, right?). I talked to the Manager (I think her name was Debra?) & voiced my utter dismay at the CONSISTENTLY AWFUL food they offer - & how sad it is because they have the ability to do so much better. Debra was nice & apologetic. She took a lap around the buffet & then came back to our table and said that I was correct - the food was indeed dry, old & had zero visual appeal. She apologized again, but then made the excuse that \"it's hard to keep breakfast foods fresh\", \"it's almost lunch anyway\" (so I guess that makes it okay?) and \"no one else complained this morning\". I told her that most people wouldn't take the time to complain, they just wouldn't come back. She said that they would start bringing out the lunch items at roughly 10:30-10:45 & that I\/we could wait and stay for lunch. I was pretty hungry at that point, so I figured another 20 minutes would have to do.\n\nWhen I finally saw them putting out fresh trays I went back to take a look. Each station had 1-3 people working - removing old food, wiping things down, etc. I picked up a pork chop (thin & well-cooked, but I was getting seriously hungry) & went to another station. The next one had, from left to right - veggies, empty tray, fish, chicken, empty tray, empty tray, marinara sauce, pasta tray - none had serving spoons or tongs. As I stood there salivating, Gal #1 finally put a spoon with the veggies, fish, sauce and pasta - so I grabbed a piece of fish & stood in front of the chicken. Gal #1 kept working on other things there, so I finally asked if I could have tongs for the chicken. She told me that I had to wait (!!!), that it wasn't time for lunch yet & then she disappeared. As I stood there waiting in front of the chicken (getting upset again & REALLY HUNGRY) Gal #2 came by & started fidgeting with things. I asked her NICELY if she could get me a pair of tongs, and jokingly added \"or should I just use my fingers\" (which I was seriously considering at this point). She shot back that lunch was not ready yet, that it would be a few more minutes & I had to wait. With that I was ABSOLUTELY DONE.\n\nI went back to our table, told my husband what happened & that I wanted to leave immediately - never eating ONE bite of food. I briefly talked to Debra (the Manager) on our way out & told her about the last incident. She apologized again, but did nothing to try to remedy it.\n\nBTW - I was NOT expecting a 5 (or even 4) star buffet here, but I was expecting edible food, which it lacked.\n\nThanks GSR, you've shown way too many times just how much you value return business - you'll never see mine again.","stars":1.0}

It's in a quiet location right off the interstate with its own parking lot. There was a good amount of outdoor seating, though I imagine on a weekend it gets really busy seeing how it was nearly a full patio on a late Monday morning. \n\nThe coffee and pastries were delicious; we bought a bag of beans that I'm currently working through and enjoying as well!

The first time I ate here I ordered the salmon (comes with mashed cauliflower!!) and it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Tonight I just ordered the kale cesar, which is phenomenal with that breaded soft-boiled egg. I would also highly recommend the beet + avocado appetizer because pistachio butter (yes, like peanut butter but with pistachios instead of peanuts) is like the best thing ever. The cocktails are all creative and delicious-- I've tried several drinks and loved them all (though I always request that if a drink has simple syrup that it either be omitted or lessened, depending on what else is in the drink). I can't wait to go back and actually try to pizza!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday morning for my friend's bachelorette brunch. I do have to tell you - we tried to change our reservation a week before to another day or increase the number of girls for Friday- it was so hard, because they were booked ALL weekend and a majority of Friday. Unfortunately, we weren't able to extend our group size, so we were seated at 2 separate tables. The tables were actually right by each other and could have easily been joined together. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our table (since we got there early), we had some drinks in the front of the restaurant, where they have the bloody mary bar and a regular full-service bar. \n\nI got a bloody mary and some of the girls got the \"pimm juice\". Let me say - BOTH were delicious. I'm not really a fan of Bloody Marys, but I had heard good things about this place, so figured I should try it. I made it with their house-made bloody mary mix, which was delicious. All the girls at the table tried it and enjoyed it as well! The pimm juice was also very good! \n\nFor food, we the soup special for the day (tomato basil with goat cheese) - let me say...it was great!! We all thoroughly enjoyed it and it was one of my favorite things on the menu. As a table, we shared the two French toast dishes (the banana foster and the daily special). Both were very good, but definitely needed the rum sauce for it to taste good. \n\nWe also got the Truffled Eggs and Spinach with a side of cream cheese grits. The dish was good, however thought it was a bit under-seasoned. It needed some salt and pepper at the very least. The grits were also good, however same thing - could have used a bit more flavor. \n\nI would definitely visit if I am back in NOLA. The service could have been a bit more accommodating and some of the dishes needed some minor improvements.","stars":4.0}

We were seated promptly upstairs and I was reminded of why I love the decor and vibe of Alma de Cuba so much. We started with scallop ceviche and a salad (I can't remember which one) and both were absolutely fantastic. I wasn't super hungry so I decided to go with the vegetarian entree and I was really disappointed. It just wasn't good. At all. My fiance's steak was absolutely delicious and I was quite jealous - I wished I had ordered something else. Our mojitos were OK....my fiance and I started out with the suave, which had nasty, nasty mint. We actually pointed out to the server that the mint just didn't taste fresh so she could tell the bartender (I was actually gagging because it tasted so chemical-y). While our next round tasted, better, I thought it would have been appropriate for her to offer to take those 2 drinks off the tab, but she didn't offer anything. Overall it was a good meal, but I think there are places with better food in the city. But if you're looking for upscale food and a beautiful, fun ambiance, this is a good bet.","stars":4.0}

Both my husband and I were in a lot of pain after we had work done with them. I went to the pretty young blond one ( can't recall her name) and had a lot of jaw pain after for weeks. I think it might have been trismis and they weren't sure when I went back to check. My husband on the hand literally was in no pain until after they did a very minor filling on him after which he needed a ROOT CANAL. He went to Dr lee I believe. He went back to our old dentist who fixed him up but now we are receiving giant bills because he's had to have so much work done to fix what they did. Furthermore, one of the hygienists he spoke to on the phone while he was in immense pain was pretty rude and insensitive to his situation- that they caused . Another thing was the dentist marked down the wrong tooth and coded it wrong so our old dentist had to redo his chart caused they messed that up too. Long story short, these dentists seem to be terrible.  I would say if only one of us was in pain, that's a fluke. But for both of us to be in pain after visiting them? Not good. Sorry Kim we love you so much this is not directed at you- you're the best hygienist in town. I wish you could go back to dr Evans!","stars":1.0}

Granted I haven't been to other NHL venues but this one seemed pretty good to me. \n\nAnd of course it helped that the game was good and fast paced, and that the Blues won that night.","stars":4.0}

Our shrimp po boys were pretty good, not great, too much bread and they use coleslaw instead of lettuce which is a weird choice.

{"text":"I just recently cancelled my OTF membership, because I'm moving back to SF in a few days. I've also been obsessing more over SoulCycle, but quite frankly, I can't afford both classes at the same time. :( However, I've had a great experience overall at OTF Center City, which is the studio closest to Penn's campus. Yes, even the cheapest membership option is pricey ($99 for 4 classes a month), but I loved that the workouts are full body-focused, consisting of running, rowing, and floor (i.e. weights) blocks for an hour. The first class is free, which is nice, because you'll get to try OTF before committing to a membership. The employees are also helpful in explaining all membership options without making you feel OBLIGATED to sign up. From my experience, I recommend taking Aamer or Nanci's classes - Aamer, because he has so much spirit in his voice, and Nanci, because her playlists are always on point. While I might not be going back to OTF for a while, I honestly don't have many bad things to say about it, except that it was pricey.","stars":4.0}

Ordered a roast pork Italiano. \n\nWhere to start, was it as I watched the cook pull the pork out of a plastic bag from the fridge and reheat it in a skillet without any au jus?  Or the spinach plucked from the fridge to be reheated in the \"Sarcone's\" as he placed it in some micro toaster oven, which by the way may have been to hide the fact that the roll was not fresh.  Alas, it was not reheated long enough, the roll was still a bit stale and the spinach remained cold at the time of consumption.  \n\nReturning to the soccer complex around the corner to enjoy my sandwich and my boy's soccer game, let's just say the soccer game was the only thing that was not a disappointment. \n\nTwo stars are for the effort and expectation, as measly as it was, wish the meal could have been better.","stars":2.0}

Too bad his meal was not to the standards of this type of restaurant.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I wanted to give this place 1 star, but I feel as though I need to give 2 stars for the way that the manager handled our very odd dining experience. She did genuinely seem to care about our experience, but it was all too far gone at that point. Of the group I was with, we all regularly eat out at nice restaurants, and one of us is affiliated with a popular, upscale restaurant in another city. Plus, we really wanted to love this place since we had friends who ate here 2 weeks before (also in the hospitality industry with very discerning standards) who said it was great.\n\nThe meal started promisingly enough. We ordered cocktails and then put in a number of starters and an entree to split between the table. The server asked if that was all of the food that we wanted, and we asked if what we ordered was enough for the table for dinner or if we should order more (perfect opportunity to up sell). The server said no, so we didn't add anything to the order.\n\nThe first grouping of appetizers that came out were good and included the brussels sprouts, which turned out to be our favorite food or the evening. I love brussels sprouts, but when that's the best item, something is wrong. This round of appetizers included all of the veges we ordered, so we knew the meat would be coming after. When we were done with the first round, our smaller share plates were cleared away and we were given larger share plates in anticipation of the meat.\n\nThis is where it got weird. No more food comes out for what seemed to be 45 minutes, and the server seemed to be avoiding our table? Like she seemed to be going out of her way to avoid us. Did she want to avoid questions about where our food was? Was she angry at us for not ordering enough food? Remember that we asked her if we needed to order more for the table and she said no. We assumed she was pissed at us for some odd reason, which we cannot fathom. We had to flag her down to order another cocktail and ask about the status of the rest of the food, which she said would be out in just a minute.\n\nFinally, the rest of the food comes and is brought out by the manager, who was apologetic and unprompted said that dessert was on the house because it took so long to get the rest of our food. How was the rest of the food? Not good. Not only was it not good, but most of it was cold, so it had obviously been sitting for a while before it was brought to us. A few very sad items in this grouping: the risotto, which was ice cold; the spaetzel, say over salted; and last but not least, the pork belly, which was supposed to be \"crispy\" but there was nothing crispy about it - it was more like an odd thing pork loin with melted mozzarella cheese on top. Very disappointing.\n\nAfter this experience, we didn't even want to brave dessert and so just asked for the check, which was not adjusted at all for the wait for our food. We asked our server about that and the manager did end up taking a chunk of the bill, though for us it was more about the principle that the money, and also said she arranged for us to have a free round at another establishment to make up for our bad experience.\n\nOn an optimistic note, everyone else dining there seemed to be very happy. Also, we had some excellent nachos next door after and stumbled upon a really cute little restaurant\/bar with swing dancing across the street.","stars":2.0}

Service was excellent, food was good and authentic.The second time the service was really slow and we had to ask the servers what we needed many times. This is a usual problem is many Asian restaurants. Servers don't have a common sense. If there is little kids at the table, they are supposed to bring water in cup with straw and lid. But instead they just bring big glass of water full of ice with no straw. How can a 3 year old drink from that glass? Anyways, service was poor at the second visit. And the food items (ALL OF THEM) were super super spicy even though we asked them mild. I don't think I will return here unless I really crave spicy Korean food.

I already had the tire off and car jacked slightly off the ground, jobs half way done for him.

Gets the car pretty high, car and his jack start wobbling. He calls his boss, speaking in another language, I hear \"tow truck\". Seems like he's saying he can't do it. I ask him what's going on, he basically is ignoring me at this point and then says \"no English\", even though we were talking earlier. I call his boss and tell him this guy is not being clear, he tells him he'll call him. Mean while, he had the car up pretty high, leans the tire in the well, realizes he can't get it higher, DROPS the car. The wheel wasn't on, so the drum hits the ground, after I start asking what he's doing, he's trying to leave. He has the slight decency to jack the car up, take the tire out, and drop it AGAIN.

{"text":"The on again, off again, on again, off again, on again franchise known as Ponderosa Steakhouse has never really abandoned its presence in the Hoosier state even during its leanest time. Started in the mid-1960's by local auto dealer Norm Wiese (along with Dan Lasater and Charles Kleptz), Ponderosa Steakhouse would rather quickly also include the Bonanza chain and would have a very modest presence in the 80s and 90s before starting to bounce back in the late 90s. It's still not a huge chain, but now operated by Homestyle Dining LLC, Ponderosa Steakhouse still has a pretty decent Hoosier presence including this Southside location. \n\nEvery time I drive by this place, it seems to be crowded. It is a steakhouse so, rather obviously, it offers modestly priced steaks (most are in the $10 - 15 range). It also offers pasta, fish, chicken and, of course, a buffet. \n\nPonderosa is housed in a free-standing building at the corner of Emerson and Thompson in the same parking lot as one of the city's two remaining Kmart stores. It's an obviously older building. They have a couple of non-ADA compliant accessible spots along with a curb cut that, oddly enough, is located across from the spots rather than next to them. I'm guessing that there's either been renovation or someone was dropping acid when they designed it. \n\nAs you enter the first set of doors, there's a second set of doors - one is for entering and going up to an ordering counter. The other is where you exit. The ordering counter has their meal menus along with their buffet, though it's not very clearly explained. I don't know that I actually saw the buffet price tonight, but the person working the counter was helpful enough that it worked. You pay, get your receipt and then you can pick out a table in their large dining room. You leave the receipt on the table and a server will bring you your drink while you go get your food. \n\nThis all seems weird considering right now on the Ponderosa website it brags that they were rated #1 in customer service for steak\/buffet restaurants (Is that really even a thing?) by Restaurant News Magazine (Which, oddly enough, really is a thing). They brag about their \"full-service,\" yet you have to go get your own food. \n\nHow is that full service? I mean, sure, they bring you your drink. Big whoop? \n\nMy server, and I use that term lightly, was Mona and she was definitely friendly and quite obsessive about clearing plates (and admitted it). I also got serenaded by a lovely young child who was belting out \"Tomorrow\" from the musical \"Annie.\" I didn't pay extra for it. \n\nThe food on the buffet consisted largely of chicken variations (tenders, fried chicken, baked chicken, bbq chicken, etc.), ham, noodles, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and a few other mostly \"homestyle\" type options. They also offer desserts, including sugar free options, and rolls. \n\nTo respect my diet, I mostly stuck with chicken options along with mashed potatoes, carrots, and a couple rolls. They also offer soups and a salad bar.  I did sample the meatloaf, but am largely avoiding red meat these days and didn't want to push it. I picked a sugar free dessert option. The food was decent - Of what I tried, truly nothing was anything I would ever go out of the way to have again. The meatloaf was probably the best. The rolls were fair, the mashed potatoes were bland, the ham was fair, and the fried chicken was standard issue fried chicken. \n\nHere's the thing. While I may have eaten a little more than I would most places since it was a buffet, it wasn't a lot more and the meal came in at about $14.50. \n\nWAY too much. \n\nI actually thought about my experience at Georgia Reese's - where you got southern style cuisine that is also incredibly overpriced. \n\nThe atmosphere is very busy. If you know the old Ponderosa style restaurants, then you have a good sense of this place. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't quite inviting either. I also found it to be a tad bit dirty and the self-serve buffet was, in spots, a bit difficult to reach from a wheelchair and staff weren't readily available for assistance. \n\nOverall, I didn't hate my time at Ponderosa. Mona was friendly and the food was decent. It was not particularly wheelchair friendly, definitely felt overpriced, and they felt the need to post signs like \"We don't give \"to go\" containers.\" I understand the reason, but it seems rather cheap and tacky. \n\nI've bounced between the idea of a 2 or a 3-star here. However, on some level the difference between the two for me is \"Will I go back?\" You can give me an average experience, but if I'm thinking to myself \"I'll still go back\" then I lean toward a 3-star rating. If, however, I immediately find myself saying \"Well, I won't be going back,\" then a 2-star rating feels more appropriate. \n\nI suppose I understand the crowd, but if I'm going to spend that much cash I expect to truly receive full service and to be a bit more content by meal's end.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"This place is a perfect example of everything that you don't want in your auto repair shop.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n(e.g.). I took my vehicle to another nearby shop to have my front brakes done exactly 8 days prior to taking it to this Midas.  The other shop inspected my vehicle and quoted me on 2 issues that I should address going forward.  I then took my vehicle back to this Midas because 1 of the areas listed was under warranty here.  After having my oil changed. The unscrupulous sales person at this location presented me with a list of approximately 9 items that needed to be repaired immediately on my vehicle totaling over $3,100.  None of the items included the item that he knew that I was under warranty for. \n\nAfter presenting the sales person at this Midas with the results of the inspection report from the other shop he changed his tune and said, \"well you probably really want to take care of THIS issue\". The 1 issue that he was referring from his list of 9 was the only issue (a valve) also listed by the other auto repair shop. So then ask yourself...why even list the other 8 when you know that they are not needed? Are they really doing the work or just billing customers for unneeded repairs? How many hard working people are you scamming because they are not getting second and third opinions?\n\nTo conclude when I told the salesman that I only wanted the 2 items done that were stated by the other shop because 1 was under warranty by this Midas.  He returns with another itemized bill for me with a system flush added on ($75 additional) that was totally unnecessary.  I of course declined that had my 2 items done and will never be back warranty or no warranty!!!!\n\nSuggestion: find a privately owned neighborhood garage that you can build a relationship and trust. That's exactly what me and my family are going to do.","stars":1.0}

No coffee, no eggs, no bread products and they ran out of CATSUP today. \nThe room... the shower was clogged and in order to turn it on you got wet because the door opens on the far side and you have to step in to turn it on.  \nThe sheets on the bed were too small so every night the sheets became a tangled mess because they came undone. Also, the sheets were never changed in in fact some days we had to call for maid service at 4:00 because the room hasn't been done. \n\nThe check in staff was great until the last day.

Give me good pizza and a micro brew and I'm in heaven.\n\nIf you come to Coal Pizza expecting premium pizza of any variety, something with premium meats, a knowledgeable serving staff, and amazing flavors in every bite.  You're going to be severely disappointed.\n\nAs our waitress arrived at our table to take our drink order I inquired about a particular beer on tap I've never had before.   This threw her for a momentary loop until she remember to pull out her notepad and read off something to the effect of 'A light refreshing beer!'.  To which I screwed up my face and asked \"yeah?'.  'Would you like one?'... 'Hmmm' .  Then I got up and walked to the bar so the owner could pull me a sample.  He was very pleasant and obviously cared about beer.  The beer in question was lemony swill, tasting like someone went fruity on a Budweiser.  I settled on a tasty amber.  Note to those explaining beer everywhere, use terms like body, malt, hops, talk about its smell, it's genre, etc... These small breweries in Indy haven't opened because people settle for a 'light refreshing beer'.\n\nWe ordered the Greek salad, a prosciutto pizza, and a pizza that was half 'cheese' and half tomato and cheese.\n\nThe salad was dandy, though the greek salad was suspiciously like a caesar, matter of fact throw some croutons on it and it could have passed for one.\n\nOne of our party members inquired as to if the pepperoni was of the spicy or mild variety, they offered to grab us a piece.   We were all obviously excited for a preview of our delicious 90 second pizzas... they brought out  a piece of pep that could have walked out a plastic bag in the refrigerator section of Marsh.    This was a preview of things to come.\n\nThe half cheese half tomato & cheese pizza came out first... someone gave the illusion of cheese dancing on this pizza, I'm not sure who's idea of cheese this was.  It was more like a light dusting.  Meh.\n\nThe 'Prosciutto' pizza came out next, it was lovely.  A hearty layer of cheese with some sliced honeydew mellon on top drizzled with balsamic.  There was obviously a bit of prosciutto there, thing was... it was totally tasteless.  The honeydew mellon and balsamic completely dominated everything about the pizza.  This was junk prosciutto, it didn't come from a local charcuterie, this was on the same level as the crap pepperoni we tasted earlier.   It was... interesting.  I understand what they were going for, but their ingredients were simply not up to the task.  ON A PIZZA CALLED 'PROSCIUTTO'  YOU'D THINK YOU COULD PICK OUT THE KEY INGREDIENT!\n\nThese pizzas were a victim of poor ingredient choice and lacking any sort of sparkle in the flavor department.   A shame.  For $16 for a 12\" pizza I was expecting something excellent.\n\nI should also mention how hot it was in the restaurant, we were all sweating by the time our meal was over.  Always nice when eating indoors.  Also, someone obviously thought out the high chair selection very well... choosing the variety that you can not flip over and sit a car seat in safely.

Delta Sky lounges are one of the best as they are large, maintained well, and offer plenty of seating with chairs, tables, and couches. Clean bathrooms on site, and a business area to connect and get some work done if needed. Pretty nice staff too.\n\nNifty spread of free eats and drinks. Water, coffee, soda, booze, beer, cocktails. Oh My!\n\nOur last trip we had a two hour wait until our fight home, and the Sky Club here made it very enjoyable.

The host was busy serving guests, making drinks, etc. They were very friendly and helpful.  Due to Covid protocols, guests can no longer help themselves for picking up small food plates. It was easy to place a request with the staff who brought items right away.  The cookies are delicious and individually wrapped! Great for a snack for the flight! There's super comfy chairs near the window, small tables near the bar area and higher seating at the bar.  There was enough space for everyone.

{"text":"Serviced apartment style hotel in a prime location in Center City. Placed at the edge of Rittenhouse Square, an abundance of shopping, restaurants, museums, and a beautiful park are within walking distance. My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights. We booked a Studio room online priced at $190\/night, and received a complimentary upgrade to a One Bedroom Apartment ($270\/night) upon arrival. The concierge was friendly, and allowed us to check in two hours early. They do not require a deposit for incidentals. \n\nThe layout of the apartment was a bit weird-enormous living room, narrow hallway shaped kitchen, small bedroom, and tiny bathroom. The decor is modern, minimalist chic-earth tones, essentials only. The space was immaculately clean. The kitchen was equipped with flatware, pots, pans, dishes, and all of the other essentials required to comfortably cook and\/or dine in, if you like. The bathroom had essentials, but only one towel, for some reason. Outlets were inconveniently placed.\n\nWhile nothing particularly wowed me about AKA, they provided a perfectly comfortable short stay in Philly. If you prefer an apartment to a more traditional hotel room layout, I would not hesitate to recommend them.","stars":4.0}

So if you choose one of these tables don't plan on dining on it. \nA second item that I purchased had a marble top. I used the delivery person that they recommended and the marble top was delivered in pieces. I spent almost 1500.00 dollars and I have little to show. \nWe go to boutiques because we want something different,  but I guess I will stay with the big stores that have reliable delivery and products that are suitable for use as intended.","stars":1.0}

Come time for my appointment I was greeted by a very tall Dr. Bryan who was uber friendly and courteous throughout the exam even though I was a bit freaked out because I was trying contacts for the first time. I'm not all that squeamish but having something sit on my eyeball all day is a bit of a mind-f to me. OK. After the exam, I was greeted by a super sweet, extra friendly Thom who very patiently brought out frame after frame while I tried them on unsure of what to settle on. All the frames seriously looked good so it was a VERY tough decision. After receiving compliments from Thom, another salesgirl (sorry, i forget her name), another salesman Dale, and a random customer in also picking out frames, I was set! And it only took a mere 3 hours!! :-) Word of advice, bring a trusted buddy with you to help shorten your visit and help make decisions because with their wide selection you'll be sure to be in there awhile!\n\nPrices are fair. I don't know what all the other comments about them being super pricey are about. Granted I have insurance so maybe that's what it is.

I also got a free trial pack of two-week contacts and box of dailys because, as a first time contact wearer, have no idea how often I'm going to use them or if I'll even like them.\n\nUpdate: The two week trial pack of contacts that I got fit funny in one of my eyes.

Fairly certain beer is not brewed on site, but I could be wrong about that. It's a Ruby Tuesday's with a slightly better beer selection. I had their light lager, comparable to a bud light. Not my favorite kind of beer, but its more wallet friendly than a nice bold craft. \n\nI ordered the buffalo bison burger with a wedge salad, dressing on the side. I like my veg. No questions, no problem. Easy order. \n\nOr so I thought. \n\nTell me yelp-verse, what does \"on the side\" mean to you? Maybe I'm wrong, but generally it means in a ramekin on the side of the plate. When my salad came it was drenched in dressing. Some dressing, whatevs, I don't care. But I  couldn't see any leafy greens, so I sent it back, politely explained that I asked for dressing on the side. \n\nWhen my salad came back there was even more dressing on the salad. now completely surrounding the plate. I realized.. they thought I meant dressing on the side of the plate. Oh. My friend who is a huge fan of blue cheese dressing decided to take the salad and move it to his bill. So no harm, but I do feel like this is waitressing 101. The waitress added on to this by rolling her eyes  when she placed the second salad in front of me. \n\nOne other complaint, our food took over an hour to receive. We got there well ahead of our movie time (1.5 hours), they weren't busy and still had to throw food down our throats and rush to the theater. \n\nThe food was fairly tasty, hence the 2 stars. everyone enjoyed their meal.

In a blatantly obvious cost-cutting move, they've eliminated the doorman position from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. They let go Bryan and the rest of the team.

We asked for waters to start and her response is \"just water?\" With an attitude and annoyed glare. A food menu was then thrown our way with no mention of specials\/happy hour like she told every other customer that sat down. She finally returns and we order beers and an appetizer. She asks for our ID and I got mine out before my boyfriend. She acts as though she has never seen the new version of our state's IDs and condescendingly asks me why it looks like that and why it's different than his ID. This ID style is not new so it made me very uncomfortable like she was accusing me of it being fake or something. I also got \"how old are you\" with an attitude as well since I guess she couldn't find the DOB line on the ID. After our appetizer came out we attempted to order food but she took my boyfriends order, never gave me the chance to order anything and then disappeared until his food came out and I then ordered something for myself. My food finally came out and she disappeared again. Our waters were both empty and about 5 minutes after we finished our beers she reappeared to ask if we wanted anything else. That had been enough so we asked for the check. She then decided to perk up and attempt to be nice but at that point it was too late.

I will submit the claim to my insurance company later. \n\nWhen I arrived the receptionist was no where near as rough as she sounds over the phone. She apologized for the wait.

We have been coming here for years and, while service has always been slow, there was always enough charm to keep us coming back. Tonight was the last straw, we went in to a packed bar with an obviously overwhelmed bartender, took nearly 15 minutes to place our order. Since it was packed we ordered our food to go. The menu has always changed, but as it stands this is a ridiculous ripoff. I got the chicken tikka for $10, which is a single skewer of chicken, with chickpeas in what tastes like thin campbells tomato soup - no spice, no body, and came with nothing - no naan, no rice. A friend got samosas - served dry, with no chutney. When I called to complain, the bartender put me on with someone who said his whole point of putting that dish on the menu was to make people buy a naan for an extra $3 (which is in no way how the menu read to me). For that price you can get MUCH better food in so many other places in philly and even in point breeze. \n\nThey have a decent beer selection and prices that are fair - not astronomical but by no means cheap. The food has always changed but it used to be that you could find something good on it at a fair price - and that was actually spiced!  This new menu is watered down, more expensive, and you get far less for it.

{"text":"After 34 years with this agency and company, we have spent the last month seeking quotes from every other Insurance company and leaving not only Nicole but State Farm, and we will never return.\n\nIn a severe rain storm in September I hit a pile of rocks that suddenly washed into the freeway in front of me, either they had fallen off of a vehicle ahead of me, or been suddenly knocked into my driving path by another vehicle in the downpour on Interstate 80 on September 21st.  The visibility was just too low to be sure where they came from, but suddenly they were directly in front of me. \n\nWith a car to my left and a cement wall to my right I had no choice but to brace myself and drive through the rocks, praying that they didn't come through my windshield.  This caused extensive damage to the front end of my vehicle and destroyed my left passenger side tire and rim.\n\nUpon my first call to Nicole's office to report the incident I was nastily told that \"This claim will be rated against your record\" by one of Nicole's very unprofessional staff.  I asked how that could be since I had absolutely no control over the weather and traffic beside me.\n\nShe then proceeded to tell me \"where I was allowed to take my vehicle\".  I told her that since I was having surgery I had already dropped it off at Lexus of Reno, where I had purchased the vehicle and had done all of my service work.  She said \"Why did you take it THERE??\"\n\nIn hindsight, we feel this is also part of State Farm's new business plan, to only allow customers to take their vehicles where they have contracts in place, opening the customer up to second-rate repairs and\/or used or non-factory parts.\n\nState Farm has what we believe to be a completely dishonest method of managing claims in order to either not pay or only partially pay for necessary repairs sustained in an accident.\n\nThey claimed that my rim had \"prior damage\" of scratches and small dents, so it would not be covered.  They then tried every dishonest method of claiming \"prior damage\" on every piece of damage on my 2010 vehicle that had 30,000 miles on it, and had just been completely serviced at the local dealer.\n\nThe dealer made no mention that my front end was out of alignment, or that my ball joint was destroyed, or that any of my rims were damaged or needing any repair.\n\nState Farm did.  Their adjustors claimed that basically every aspect of my repair had either \"prior damage\" or deducted \"betterment\" (usage) to their coverage of the repair.\n\nWhen all was said and done, Nicole and State Farm covered less than 1\/3 of the repair costs to my vehicle.\n\nWe now have no doubt that this is State Farm's new Business Model in order to increase profits, while charging some of the highest premiums in the industry.\n\nAn online consumer survey that I found rates 42% of State Farm clients as \"Extremely Dissatisfied\".  I recommend that all of them take the time as we did to research other Insurance companies, and take their business elsewhere.","stars":1.0}

Without fail, every prior reservation was an executive class SUV like a high end Yukan, or Suburban and that's what we expect when we pay these kinds of rates.\n\nExcel sent a Nissan Pathfinder, which I believe was the personal vehicle of the driver (at least that's what she told me). If I was calling for an Uber that would be just fine. Excel presents itself as a high end transportation company and clearly they are not. I just want everyone to go in with the proper expectations. \n\nTo add insult to injury they charged us a $50 cancellation fee. \n\nIn a scramble I called BEST Transportation and they were very helpful and saved my bacon. Kelsie was great to deal with and deserves kudos.\n\nAvoid Excel and all costs - grab an Uber instead if that's your need and pay a fourth of the price.","stars":1.0}

Inside of the Mahaffey it's organized very well with two floors and several full liquor bars on each floor for convenience.

{"text":"This place seems to be getting a bad rap in reviews. We decided to try it anyway due to their commitment to use quality ingredients (grass-fed beef etc.). We were pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe burgers (from Pineland Farms beef) were actually quite tasty and reasonable in size, maybe a bit bigger than these types of places typically do. The fries were clearly from real potatoes and were not \"over-fried.\" They could use some salt, although we prefer it that way and letting us add it rather than drenching them with salt as so many places do. \n\nWe are gluten free and chose to get the burgers \"green style.\" This was served on a bed of tasty kale. One of us got the \"West Side\" burger with avocado, chipotle, and lime. The add-ins were fresh and delicious. \n\nThe service was good. Maybe it takes a bit longer than a typical fast food burger joint, but that's because they cook to order. I'd rather not have my food pre-cooked and sitting under a heat lamp.\n\nAt the end of our meal a staff member came over and gave each of our kids apples. That was really kind and thoughtful. \n\nThis experience was a good reminder to give a place a chance even when it doesn't get 4+ stars on Yelp--sometimes, especially with a new concept, the audience doesn't get it yet, and new places need to hit their groove. \n\nWe are happy we tried it, and we will be back.","stars":5.0}

When I asked her if we could get it remade she said it would take just a few minutes.... not sure why she thought it was OK to serve it if making a replacement was that quick and easy. I would have preferred she told me it was burnt and they were remaking it then having to go through asking A MANAGER to do a quality control on the food she is running. Honestly, if I was the owner of this place I would be beyond embarrassed to have a manager that thought this was OK.

And the name is fitting because those giant delicious fried shrooms were topped with a fancy balsamic glaze and delicious! The Mick & Cheese Balls are softball sizes fried Mac and cheese. They manage to deep fry them without drying out the mac and cheese inside and honestly I think they use magic because idk how they do it! Now, the Reuben bites were not like anything I had before. Corned beef and Swiss chopped up and deep fried into the perfect bite size! They're tasty and flavorful! Although it pains me to choose, those were my favorite!\n\nThere was a group of us dining so luckily we got to try a lot! My top three are as follows: \n\nFish and chips which were perfectly breaded in a delicious beer batter and fried to a golden brown. Everything about this dish was tasty. \n\nShepard's Pie. It's homemade From scratch daily. It was the best I've ever had. It was so flavorful and filling! The potato to meat ratio was perfect. \n\nCorned beef and cabbage. Wow. I don't know how they manage to get it so tender. It was juicy and perfectly laid on a bed of potatoes, cabbage, and carrots. I would come back and eat it every single day if I could. When it's gone it's gone so if it's what you're craving call to make sure they haven't sold out first!\n\nIf you're looking for authentic Irish dishes that won't break your bank, great atmosphere and impeccable service, run, don't walk to The Forge.","stars":5.0}

HE WAS SO IMPRESSIVE... #1 he's been in the business for many years, decades ... but the man does not look old at all. But he is a genius by how he crafted his menu and the price point . \n\nLet me discuss the Lisa Bowl.. OMG.. the flavors and the portion was PERFECT... At the onset of the dish being sat in front of me.. I wanted to ask for salt and pepper to put on it.. But since there was no salt  &  pepper shakers on the table . I just said try it first before even going there.. When I took my first bite into the bowl.. the combination of everything was PERFECT and the taste was nothing short of amazing. As I was eating it , I was thinking this will not be enough food for me I will  still be hungry, want more food.. In actuality once I was done I was satisfied. \n\nTalking with James found out he uses all fresh ingredients, NO PROCESS FOODS at all.. I guess that's why the Lisa bowl was simple but perfection. The cost for the bowl was a little over $5 from what I remember. All I know it was not expensive at all.. \n\nJames also makes fresh everyday.. English muffins.. he showed me a batch of them.. they looked delicious, I am not even a big fan of English Muffins.. but when I do return to this restaurant I will have one then . \n\nTHIS PLACE IS A EXCELLENT PLACE TO EAT BREAKFAST OR LUNCH..

First, the teller enters the wrong amount for the bond (in their favor). I didn't know until he was dispensing my cash.  I'm no stock broker, but I am pretty sure that's a big deal.  Even the manager was nonchalant about the whole ordeal.  Also, the bond amount was grossly miscalculated (also in their favor).  Luckily, I did my research before I walked in.  And, after rechecking with the Department of Treasury, I can assure you this Wells Fargo location was trying to pull a fast one.  \n\nAdditionally, they tried to get me to sign up for a checking account.  This comes with some pretty steep checking fees unless you follow their strict guidelines, which have multiple avenues for delinquency, to which they (you guessed it) charge you more fees.  After asking a lot of questions, and reading some fine print, I decided to go against a checking or savings account with this institution.  \n\nAfter my experience today, I will definitely never be back to this location, and it has probably ruined the Wells Fargo name as far as I am concerned.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"We ended up here because it was very close to our hotel, walking distance, and other options were closing soon. Or server was Jami. If you ever want to see what a professional, friendly, and 'can do' attitude are like, you need to go to Cracker Barrel and ask for Jami to be your server. I like my steak very rare, and since I have had kind of average sreak experiences at other Cracker Barrels, I was very ready to give them a pass on this. But it turned out the steak was rare and totally to my liking. Hence the 5 stars. My ribeye came with three sides, and I ordered the craziest things that I could think of. From those I liked the kale salad, although it was way too sweet. I also liked the turnip greens, I did not really fall in love with the fried okra although I dipped it in ranch by suggestion of Jami, which made it a little better. Overall we had a great experience.","stars":5.0}

The biggest complaint is they don't know how to poach an egg properly! Seriously two dishes both had poached eggs in them and they were awful. Hard yolk inside but the whites were still runny. I don't even know how you do that. The eggs and lamb were mediocre... Nothing was good. Definitely skip this place for brunch. I wish I could say something positive...

There was only 2 people in when I arrived and 3 others arrived after me. The lady kept working on them first because I presume, the services they asked for was faster while leaving me soaking in water. The young man she would send over to do various services in between ( lotion massage, remove nail polish etc) could not have moved slower and it was painfully obvious he was a stall to prevent complaints from customers. 1-1\/2 hrs later, I told them I must leave (pedi still not completed and mani yet to begin) she slaped the acrylic on, filed but didn't built up nail nor shaped it properly followed by a polishing my 6yr old nephew could have done better. All for the cost of 38 bucks. I didn't bother getting the mani as I had no interest in spending my entire evening there, especially with the obvious poor job on my pedi. I'm not sure how much longer they will be in service but, it will not be because of me.","stars":1.0}

It took almost an hour to get a table. The one thing that we didn't like was that they won't allow you to sit at the bar to wait, because of Covid, but everyone is told to wait at the bottom of the ramp outside and be just in as close of quarters. I just didn't quite understand that and the wait would've been more manageable had we been able to have some cocktails while we waited.\n\nThey did create a new cocktail on their menu, it was a strawberry basil bourbon and it was fantastic. We also enjoyed some of their draft beers from Florida microbreweries that were very good.\n\nWe did order the nachos for an appetizer and they came out on basically a cookie sheet. They were loaded with toppings and were absolute perfection. So much goodness and value. We were so full from the nachos we weren't sure if we were going to order more food, but couldn't pass up the seafood pot.\n\nWe got the ultimate pot of crab, shrimp, clams and oysters, sausage, potatoes and corn. It was all so full of flavor. It was $30 and absolutely loaded with enough food for two. We shared. We still had to bring all the sausage home and it was enough to feed both of us for breakfast with some eggs.\n\nThe view of the sunset was fantastic, the building and bar and deck are everything you want for a tropical Florida feel.  We would definitely come back again.","stars":5.0}

He returned about a week later with a key which had to be custom made since the standards didn't fit this armoir.  \n\nDanny is very professional and understands the importance of good customer service.

{"text":"About a month ago, I decided to give cool sculpting a try, I found the Spa through Internet and made a consultation appt. The lady , in charge of evaluating new clients, gave me all the info that is routinely given to all new clients, stating : Some bruising and or swelling may occur, but most people, resume normal activities after the procedure. NOT. Please be aware that they NEVER PREPARED ME TO THE WHAT IFS in the event of a side effect. My procedure was extremely painful and all I was offered from a nurse was 2 Tylenol during the procedure, omg!\nI never saw the doctor once! I left the office after 3 hours, in obvious pain and was told that a prescription would be called into my pharmacy by the doctor. I sent a relative to pick up by evening to find out it was Never called in. I used 4 Advil tablets every 4 hours to manage my pain. The next day I was flying to Florida for a weeks vacation. my prescription was once again neglected to be called in even though I reminded the young lady who made the day after call on how I was doing .By the time I boarded the flight I looked like I was 7 months pregnant from the swelling and could only fit into my husbands 2xl sweats as it was impossible to wear any loose clothing of my own. My plane ride was beyond painful, since I couldn't even sit properly from the swelling. I spent the 2nd and 3rd day taking excessive advil to help with the pain and day 4 and 5 taking prescription medication from a relative , just so I can get out of bed for a bit.\nMy bruising has now become very visible and sensitive to the touch. My vacation was nothing but bed rest for me, which was totally better than should I was still working. My 2nd phone call was at day 10 from doctors office, as I expressed my concern of their lack of post procedure instructions. The office manager called me to follow up at day 16, Are u kidding me ! Again at no point did I ever see the \"Doctor\" cause he runs 2 different offices. Well good for him that he is so busy, but at this point I felt just a #, not a patient. As I approached the 30 day mark, totally make it through this hump, my follow up apt is around the corner, Time to check my progress, should I go ? No I decided what is the point for them to praise my progress when they were NEVER involved in my recovery. I sadly blame myself as well for not inquiring for more info ahead of time. Please do all the HW you can before any procedure, no matter how small it seems, and advise to speak to the doctor as well, Assuming there is one running the show not just collecting the Cash.","stars":1.0}

We pulled directly into the wash bay where two attendants sprayed us down and got the van prepped for the automatic portion of the car wash that we just drive through. My husband gave his credit card to the attendant on the drivers side who at that point wanted to know what level of wash we wanted and was accepting our payment. He went to run our credit card while the attendant on the passenger side preceded to completely soap up the passenger side of the van. The first attendant returned and asked if we had cash, that their credit card machine had just broke. When we told him that we didn't, he told us that we would just have to back out then! My husband and I just looked at each other in disbelief, as it was THEIR machine that had just broke and we were sitting there with a van that had soap all over half of it!! I asked if they could at least rinse us off first and he said no, that we just needed to back up since we couldn't pay!! He then preceded to have the four cars that were behind us back up onto the highway so that we could back up! I was furious at this point, that they were just leaving us with a soapy van, and went to speak with the manager who's name was John! He just kept saying \"well what did you expect us to do, our credit card machine had been working fine before we ran your credit card\"!! REALLY, and these customer service skills is what got you a managerial position!!? Needless to say, there were many words exchanged between him and I, as I have NEVER been treated so poorly by a business representative before, especially when the problem was on their end!

You can order typical diner fare (sandwiches, burgers, pasta, eggs, breakfast, etc.) but they also have an Asian menu which we've never tried but I would probably steer clear from that. The omelet's here are GIGANTIC and really delicious. My sister's waffle was delicious, it tasted really fresh and fluffy.  My other sister ordered a prime rib sandwich that came on garlic bread. The rest of our table ordered the same: sandwiches or omelet's and everyone was satisfied.\n\nI was happy with my meal, I expected diner food and got a little more.

After that, all of the curbside spots were taken, so I parked in a spot and tried calling to see if I could just have them either come to my car and deliver it, even though it's not at a curbside spot or if I could come in an just pick it up. I waited on the phone for over 5 minutes just for no one to pick up. I then go inside to see a line of people waiting for their food as well. I spoke with the front of house to see if my order was ready and was not given the time of day. They even asked me to repeat my order as if they just couldn't go back and check on the screens, which I know they can, as I have worked in fast food my entire adolescence. They ended up telling me that they were waiting for my call, which I clearly tried, but was not even answered, so why would I call again? That's why I ended up going inside to tell them my order and even told them I ordered through curbside. In the end, I waited 52 minutes from start to finish just for 2 dozen breadsticks and sauce....that's it!

The prices may seem high at face value for burgers, but the quality was impeccable and when comparing them to other similar places, I think you get very good value for the money. The fries were also out of this world, especially with the roasted garlic mayo.

We also had iced tea which was very diluted and tasteless. \n\nWhen the quesadillas were brought to the table we were surprised by the meager amount of food on the plate. The salmon quesadilla was very salty, ultra thin sliced salmon inside of a very thin burrito. The only flavor was SALT. My friend's pork burrito had a bit more flavor but was also very meager.\n\nIt was one of the worst lunches I have ever had.

{"text":"I've been a patron of RoCo since the early 1990s, and even though I live in the Bay Area now I still make sure to stop by the Gutierrez Street location every time I'm in town.\nThe in-house roaster is a treat for the senses when it's running. The desserts are okay, nothing special but they hit the spot if you're in need of a coffee and sugar rush. The coffees are generally excellent, but the last time I visited, in December 2009, it seemed the beans had been underroasted or perhaps stored too long. \nThe Mexico Altura, which I bought whole-bean for a drip machine and a Chemex glass coffeemaker, was stale and bland. The beans had none of the essential oil that even a medium roast needs for full taste. I was also disappointed in the Montecito Blend, normally a great coffee from Santa Barbara Roasting Co.\nBut I base my generally positive review on my previous experiences, where both the in-house servings and the take-home beans were spectacular, bold and full of taste. I also just love the place. It's comfortable and always available and just a nice place to relax in the beautiful town where I grew up.\nI just hope they pay a bit more attention to their roasting and to the freshness of their beans. Peets is in town and it serves up a generally great brew, so this place can't rest on its laurels.","stars":3.0}

Our favorite was the parm! The corrado needed some kind of sauce (pesto mayo, house gravy, or something) Rosemary fries were very good! But they got cold too fast in the bag the come in & little over cooked. Couldn't tell if they were just sitting for awhile or made to order.\n\nEntrees & pasta dishes very small portion sizes. What ever happened to the \"Italian Portion Sizes?\"  Entrees only come with a small piece of roll and no side of pasta or salad. By the time you get a side\/salad you can order a takeout dinner from Franco's,Ragazzi's  and get a side,soup & salad cheaper  or just go out to an and is just as good. \n\nPasta dishes way over priced for just a pasta of your choice & sauce.

{"text":"It was so good, my family and I ate here two mornings in a row...yes that good.  We visited Tucson to attend my cousin's wedding and being the big foodie we all are, I did some online research on great brunch places....A picture of the avocado toast at First Watch was what caught my eye and after showing my family members the rest of the photos, I knew we had to go.  \n\nWe showed up on a Saturday morning and there was about a 30 minute wait.  My dad was reluctant to wait, but I told him, if there is this much people here on a Saturday morning in Tucson, it MUST be good! haha. \n\nWell to our very own surprise, everything we had was amazingly delicious and flavorful!  Each item on the dish was so fresh as well, from the avocados to the strawberries...yum!  The next morning we were thinking we should try a new place, but thinking about how great of a meal it was the first time, my family and I came to a consensus to try something new on the menu at the same restaurant!  DEAL! haha. \n\nMost Memorable Dishes: \n- Chickichanga - this is a definite must!  Loved this so much and I wish I got it again on my second day there!  Instead of a tortilla wrap, the wrap was made with eggs, kind of like a crepe, and it was filled with a bunch of flavorful southwestern ingredients...yum!  Definitely worth trying. \n\n- Million Dollar Bacon - not sure if this is a special, since it's only the blackboard, but it was delicious!  Four strips of bacon topped with maple syrup and brown sugar and cooked just right.  The sweetness really balanced out the saltiness, perfect combo! \n\n- Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - definitely get this if you are a sweets person!  The pancakes were so fluffy and light and topped with that sweet and tart lemon ricotta with strawberries, definitely a great end to an amazing brunch! \n\n- Sourdough Toast - I mean, it's just bread, but dang, that bread they use, toasted with some butter, my mom was fighting me for it from my plate!  I literally had to guard her from taking another slice! hahaha.  Being the good son that I am, I surrendered and gave her the last slice. lol. \n\n- Mediterranean Baked Eggs - aka \"shashuka\" - it was actually pretty good!  Not the same as the shashuka I have had in NYC, but their rendition of the Mediterranean breakfast dish was pretty good!  The tomato based sauce pairs very well with the ciabatta bread it comes with.  Super flavorful!  \n\nThings I did not really enjoy - the chicken melt, the club sandwich, and the french toast.  The french toast sounded really good on the menu, but when we got it, it was just okay, not terrible, just no wow factor for me.  I also tried the biscuit and gravy, also just okay.  \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this breakfast and brunch place to anyone visiting Tucson!  It is a local chain (I think) but you will be getting a really good meal at a very good price (compared the East coast prices that I am used to) haha.  Go eat and enjoy!","stars":5.0}

This place is super busy, but after sitting there waiting for awhile, and what normally should be an hour max, for breakfast, took almost two.  You will definitely wait 20min for a table, and while the servers are attentive and friendly, you will wait another 35-40 minutes for your food once you place the order.  While watching, I noticed not allot of food coming out of the kitchen..seems really slow.  I think half the battle and reason why it's so busy, is because the kitchen can't keep up.  Also, you can spend about $8 on three chocolate chip pancakes and get nothing else with it, I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous!  So I ended up getting eggs Benny with salmon.  It was OK.  Honestly, I enjoyed the same thing allot better at Daily Eats, who are just as busy, half the size, but allot faster.  This place makes breakfast feel like a project, our whole experience with this place took almost two hours.  Breakfast should not be complicated, and while the food is good, it is not worth the headache that comes with it.  Not when there's so many other options in Tampa.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"This place is amazing!  Best BBQ in town in my opinion.  We split a brisket platter with the truffle mac n cheese and baked beans.  Everything was delicious.  The brisket was incredibly tender, the flavor of the truffle mac is the best I've tasted, and I loved the baked beans -- they're a little on the spicy side, which I enjoy.  The only problem was they ran out of their citrus chipotle sauce -- because it's so dang popular!  The other sauces are good too, so I survived.  I also love the seating area they built next to their custom built truck.  \n\nBottom line:  I can't wait to go back and if you're looking for good BBQ you have to try the Smoke Shack!","stars":5.0}

Husband and teen daughter went to pick it up and called me from restaurant to ask if there was a different soup youngest daughter wanted to substitute for the veggie soup they were out of. The young lady who assisted my husband in gathering his food for pickup went above and beyond to make sure our order was right and we had everything we needed to make our meal enjoyable! Husband did not remember her name but she was pregnant and extremely courteous and helpful! She came out with our food in a huge heavy duty cardboard box along with plates, cups, straws, utensils, and even two large cups of ice for the sweet tea we ordered. That girl was hustling to make sure we had everything we needed-very impressed with her work ethics and hospitality. Got back to hotel with food and everything was hot and delicious!

It was quiet, a few random heads sitting and watching Olympic Curling and Ice Dancing on a small television leaving us plenty of space at the bar. It was comforting.\n\nWe ordered some beers and I asked for a menu. It is a short menu and I decided to go for a special. Special is an understatement: Rabbit sausage. I had never had rabbit before, but it was damn tasty. \n\nAn interesting mix of herbs helping tame the gaminess of the meat. The potatoes were layered with sauteed onions. I was hopping happy out the door to a prior engagement in under 45 minutes from walking in, but I would have gladly stayed longer.\n\nDecent service, but I will reserve that fifth star for a stellar return.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I had a mixed experience here. \n\nI booked an appointment, and the day before I was to come in I got a call from one of the employees asking about what sort of dress I wanted. I had some pretty specific ideas, and I was really impressed by how much she wanted to help me find the dress I was seeking (no bling, trumpet cut, maybe some lace, no flowers, no bows). I even sent her some pics of dresses I liked via email. She told me that she'd pick out dresses that were similar.\n\nBut when I got there, I was disappointed. The dresses that had been picked out for me were really not similar to the ones I'd talked about over the phone and sent pictures of. I looked around the shop and found that there really wasn't anything I was interested in, and the sales ladies started to get rather pushy, telling me that they could radically alter one of the dresses they'd shown me to match the style I was looking for and that I should put down a deposit fast before someone else snatched it up. Why would I want to pay for a dress that is very different from what I'd like in hopes that hacking it up and sewing it back together will make it into something acceptable?\n\nIn the end, I felt like they'd wasted a lot of my time -- since we talked on the phone and I sent photos, they should have easily been able to tell me that they just didn't have the sort of dress I wanted at that time. I was very clear about what I wanted but still spent about 2 hours at an appointment trying to explain why I didn't want this, that, and the other dress...that shouldn't have been necessary, since I was so clear and specific about what I was seeking.\n\nFor discount dresses, I think Sabrina Ann (in Ardmore) or RK Bridal (NYC) or Bridal Garden (NYC) are much better choices.","stars":2.0}

Yet what it lacks in retro light bulbs and marshmallows, RDS makes up in pounds of character and raw sex appeal. The patio is a welcome retreat on those cool fall and spring evenings.

{"text":"This restaurant has been voted one of Edmonton's best Thai restaurants by See magazine several years in row, and I can see why. The food here is delicious. My husband and I came in at 5pm, and we were the only customers there. After 5:30 groups of people began to pour in. The greeting person sat us at the table by the window and handed us the menus. I have noticed that the restaurant is decorated with mostly red colors which gave the place an elegant and clean look. Upon the first glance at the menu, I was astonished to see that most entrees are priced $20 and up. Rave reviews in local newspapers never mentioned anything about this place serving the food at the prices of upscale restaurants. So I reached for specials menu and ended up ordering marinated chicken breasts with roasted eggplant and basil on a bed of French fries. My husband chose to order Yam Yai salad (noodles, BBQ pork and shrimp in honey sesame dressing) and Phuket Fisherman soup. To make our wait a bit more pleasant, we also ordered two cups of coffee latte which turned out to be strong, sweet and plain amazing. When our food arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the dishes. After splitting the soup and the salad, we already felt full and happy, and we haven't even touched the chicken and eggplant dish! It was fresh, with lots of spices and a generous amount of sauce. We could really taste the basil which gave the dish balanced flavor. Finger licking good is what I would call this dish. Our server was very pleasant and polite. The tab for two people was $50 and I believe it was money well spent. The King and I has every chance of becoming my favorite Thai restaurant.","stars":4.0}

I don't eat escargot but everyone at the table wasn't too excited. It comes in a creamy sauce. It was a little bland compared to what they were anticipating. The french onion soup is different from other restaurants. It is very caramelized? It almost taste like balsamic vinegar. That could be a good thing or bad.

It is not immediately apparent what they spent two hours doing the entire time. I can see the fridge, drawers, and cabinets were wiped down in the kitchen. The floor was vacuumed and mopped. Some of the moldings were wiped down and the fans dusted. That does not take two hours and means nothing if the toilet is left unclean.

We then get our food order marked down, and wait about 10 minutes without being asked if we needed anything (no food is a good sign of this) until my buddy holds up the food slip and says \"Can someone take this please?\"\n\nAfter that we receive our rolls a couple at a time, by staff that literally doesn't give a fuck (only word to appropriately describe the service) and then someone who we believe to be the owner came out, rearranged all of the food on the table, and when we asked which rolls were which (one of us was lactose intolerant, another was allergic to shellfish) the response we received was \"Who cares share it!\"\n\nFuck you. Do NOT rearrange our table because you want it to be a certain way, and DO NOT tell the people at your restaurant that their order doesn't matter.

While the facility is not very spa-like, and the desk folks really push for the paid membership (in which I was not interested on a first visit), my therapist was excellent.  Her name is Crystal, and she was very skilled in acupressure and other therapeutic massage methods.  I can't attest to how other therapists at Elements may perform, but was pleased with Crystal.  Another cautionary note - in booking a 90 minute massage - it is really on 80 minutes.  They count off 5 minutes for changing on either end of the massage, allowing for only 80 minutes of massage.  The same would be true for a 60 minute booking - it would be just 50 minutes.

I've been on tea kicks here and there in my life (last time before most recently was during a trip to Michigan where I found a small store with great teas) but most haven't stuck. \n\nSo when I got back home from traveling overseas I kept drinking tea and bought boxes from local grocery stores until I remembered the store in Michigan which made me want to drink more handmade, high quality teas. \n\nThis led me to Yelp which lead me to Traveling Tea. When I walked in I at first didn't see the whole selection (I wasn't being that observant lol) but once I took the whole store in I noticed that they do have a big selection. The selection was overwhelming in a good way. It was basically a \"there are so many good things to choose from which makes it more difficult but I know I'll really love what I buy and enjoy it\" type overwhelming. The good type of overwhelming as said above. \n\nI ended up buying the Cacao Chai Tea and have to say that it has excellent flavor. Very smooth with definite hints of cacao. Ultimately I was hoping for something with a higher caffeine content but I would still rate this a fantastic tea due to the flavor. I will say that my tea palette is still being refined but I'd rate that tea a 8 or 8.5\/10. If the caffeine content were higher the rating would be higher as well. YMMV based on how caffeinated you like your teas. \n\nI also bought a one serving tea from their high caffeine shelf and can't wait to try that. It was the Guayusa Ginger Citrus. Citrus + heavy caffeine sounds wonderful. Can't wait to try it. \n\nAs others have said, the hours aren't very standard on certain days so be sure to look up the hours on their website before driving there. \n\nAll in all this seems to be a great place to shop if you are looking for good teas and I will definitely be back. I'd give it a 4.5\/5 rating so I gave it a 5\/5 since yelp doesn't allow us to do half stars which I think is unfair and didn't want to rate it a 4\/5.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Walked in the waitress immediately said they are out of a lot of items on the menu like mushrooms and zucchini. Not a big deal nothing I wanted. They were short staffed so it took a lil bit to get our food not a big deal, again we had time and we got our drinks right away. I got a plain dog and my boyfriend got a sandwich with fries. I was expecting a street hot dog but it was more like an Oscar Mayer  something you'd get at a family bbq. You could get 3 Costco hotdogs for the price of this one small hotdog. Little disappointed about that. My boyfriend liked his sandwich a lot and it was an ok size. Waitress was nice but we probably won't be coming back anytime soon.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"Well, I had to think of the exact words I wanted to use to describe our experience at Pasco's, but the usual words like \"Excellent, Amazing, Phenomenal, & Incredible\" would just not do. \n\nOur usual places were not an option since it was a bit late (9:00 PM), and Tucson not being famous for offering good food late in the evening, we were worried that we would have to settle for something sub-par\n\nEnters YELP to the rescue! I had Pasco in my bookmarks as a place to try, so I suggested we give it a go. After all, the reviews were really good and some of the pictures that other Yelper's had attached were just calling to us.\n\nWe arrived on Thursday and found the place quite easy. The temperature was nice and perfect for outdoor seating, so we took a table out in the front.\n\nOur server, Nick (remember the name, this guy is awesome!), greeted us right away and provided our menus.\n\nWe began with drinks and the house made horchata was beyond expectation according to my companion, and while I don't remember exactly the name of my drink, all I had to do was tell Nick that I liked berries, citrus, and sweet flavors, and he came back with a sparkling wine and berries drink that had me closing my eyes in delight every time I took a sip.\n\nNow to the food:\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews and looking at some of the pictures that previous Yelper's had posted, we were intrigued and decided to try the Chardonnay Smoked Salmon, but upon searching the menu, we realized it was not there, so we inquired about it.\n\nNick explained that Pasco's uses \"In Season Ingredients\" which makes the menu change every few months. Happy with this explanation we decided to see what else was in the menu to entice us.\n\nEverything looked really good, but both of us were called by the Big Boy Burger, which should be renamed to \"The AMAZING Big Boy Burger\"! The meat was cooked perfectly, just the way I asked, and it was juicy, tender and the flavor was beyond description!  The Hollandaise sauce was creamy and a perfect complement to the cheese, egg, meat, and vegetables!\n\nI really cannot describe the explosion of flavor upon my first bite. No comparison to any other burger I have ever eaten before! In this, Pasco is on a class of it's own! \n\nNothing could have prepared me for the delicious experience that nearly took me into ecstasy! No burger has ever even come close! No Kobe burger, no Angus or Sirloin have ever been more delicious! Not even the $30.00 burger at another well known restaurant in town could compare to the mouthwatering experience that The Big Boy Burger delivered!\n\nBut don't take my word, just try it and you too will agree!\n\nWhile dinning at Pasco's, we felt welcomed and well cared for. Nick was always attentive and ready to help and it just made the experience more enjoyable.\n\nThe ambiance was relaxed and friendly, and at one point the manager came by our table to introduce himself and to see if everything was alright. Before we were finished with our meals Nick came to our table with some delicious Biegnets filled with dark chocolate, sitting in a caramel sauce. They were delightfully sinful and there was a spiciness to them that I couldn't quite place, absolutely heavenly!\n\nAfter our meal we felt so relaxed and happy we decided to just chill there enjoying the nice evening chatting away. Before we knew it we had spent 3 hours and didn't even notice the time fly by!\n\nThis is a first for us, for every time we had gone out we usually leave right after our meal, but everything about Pasco was so welcoming and relaxed that we just sat there chatting and enjoying our drinks.\n\nSo, we discovered no only a great place to eat with amazing food, but a wonderful lounge where to sit and enjoy some good conversation over some drinks! Nothing could be better!\n\nWe left Pasco feeling that we had discovered a new place to call our own. I look forward to our next visit and I know that I will be bringing those who I want to introduce to one of the best spots in Tucson!\n\nThank you Pasco, and thank you Nick! Our visit was one of the best experiences and we will be back!","stars":5.0}

I liked that - I appreciate rotating menus that feature really unique combinations. \nMy group got the pork belly poboy, meatloaf poboy, and two sides, one of rice, and one of sweet potato salad. The pork belly was much too sweet for my taste, and dripping in the sauce. The bread was saturated. The meatloaf was much better and much less soggy.

I  have also had the cheesesteak eggrolls which i would not recommend.  First because they are $12 for 6 smaller pieces and they are more corn dog and egg roll The beers were a bit pricey at $7 especially for a place that has a subtle hint of paddy's pub, however they do have specials during happy hour that make it pretty cheap\n\nOverall i would say this is an avg bar which can be easily overlooked if it were not owned by some Philadelphia celebs.

When I proceeded to tell him that Mikaela talked down to us and laughed in my face he asked what I did before she did that, not once did we receive any kind of apology or even empathy, but rather, we got even more disrespected by the MANAGER! We responded that that we come from the generation that believes the customer is always right. Erik smirked & responded, \"not always.\" \nBoth our phones have been out of service for 48+ hours. We left with the number for Erik's supervisor and are not letting this go. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE!!

Superb, two little fried cakes that absolutely delicious.\n\nFor the main course my wife got surf and turf and I got filet mignon, which granted isn't exactly a Greek specialty but I'm a sucker for steak.

Lamb kabobs on a bed of lentils and lamb sausage, and shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce with feta on top.\n\nAnd to top it off, a tremendous sampling of sticky sweet Greek desserts.

{"text":"Ok, so I'm a lifelong avid reader and book collector. So I buy books....alot of them. Some of them (first\/special editions etc) very pricey.  Reading and collecting books is pretty much my only hobby. So I'm pretty much happy in any place that has or sells books, and for the most part Books a Million is a happy place for me. Yeah their selection is decent, and if they don't have it they'll order and have it delivered to you. It's spacious and clean, and while The bathrooms aren't exactly immaculate,  they're passable.  There's a small cafe where you can purchase coffees,  smoothies, and basic pastries along with limited seating. Their magazine selection is actually fantastic, and they have a pretty decent bargain priced selection as well.  They also have a limited selection of LPs and various book themed gift items. Sounds pretty good so far right!!??  It does.  That is until you need help with something. Good luck finding someone, and if you do, good luck with them having the time or care in actually helping.  That is until you go to pay for your purchases. This right here is where this location,  has lost this customer, who spends a shit ton on books, forever. I won't be back. Ever. First I bought some books, and upon checking out the guy asked me if I was interested in the rewards program. I told him politely,  no thanks I've heard the run down before. Not interested please just ring me out. He then went on to explain how awesome the program is, how much it can save me, yadda yadda yadda,  and it'll ONLY cost you 25 bux to do so. Now I'm a firm believer that spending money to save money is stupid ( that's just me) and in kinder words told him so, and again asked him to PLEASE just ring me out.  He continued to push the program. Now I've worked retail my entire life, and I get that that is his job. I also get they probably have a quota of how many new members they have to sign on. But I also believe that after twice asking him to seriously please just ring me out, he should have done so. He didn't. He also went on to insult me, and make me feel like an idiot for not wanting to spend an extra 25$ on my already hefty purchase. Long story short,  he extended a 3 minute transaction into a nearly 10 minute one,  insulted a customer, and I still didn't buy their damn plan.  Fast forward to a week later when a special edition book I've been waiting for is finally released.  I happen to already be in the mall so I say screw it and try them again. I grab the book I wanted, plus 7 more, which would have brought my purchases to a bit over 300$.  I go to pay.  There's a woman in front of me already in the process of paying, and guess what?  The woman ringing her out is trying to talk her into the rewards plan.  The customer is saying no thanks, the employee continues to push it.  I check the time on my cell and begin timing this interaction.  As I'm waiting there's another employee behind the counter who doesn't offer to help me.  Long story short....EIGHT minutes in I slam my 8 books on the counter, say \" I hope that 25$ membership your trying to  force  on this poor girl is worth the 300 plus dollars in sales you just lost\"....and left. And I won't return.  The three stars are because it is a beautiful store, and...well books.  But all I want to do is browse happily,  grab my selections,  pay for them and leave. They refuse to let you do that. So if your there and in a hurry, don't plan on actually buying anything. Driving to Barns and Noble would be faster.","stars":3.0}

You enter the two liberty building, do coat check and then take a private elevator to the 37th floor. We had window seats and sat at the bar until it was ready. The view is incredible. Personally, I would only come if I had window seats. It started with small bread muffins, the butter mixture for this was very tasty. We ordered the seafood trio and braised rib sliders for an appetizer. The trio was okay, the shrimp was amazing but only two pieces. The lobster was good. The piece of fish that came with it I wasn't a fan of. If I could, I would order just the shrimp next time. For our main courses I got the roasted chicken and lobster Mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the braised ribs and fillet. We both enjoyed our dish. The lobster Mac and Cheese was heavenly. I would order five servings without regret. Definitely try this. For dessert we got vanilla cake, which had a lava center that was warm and delicious, and coffee dessert. Overall great experience. Our host was very attentive I wish we could have tipped him even more.","stars":4.0}

The entrance was interesting and uniquely designed. There were quite a few steps, followed by a long, semi-steep walkway. The inside was a lot smaller than expected, but nicely done. There was ample seating and a balcony (which is where I spent most of the night). The full bar did not disappoint lol! However, the food did disappoint. The mini muffalettas were more bread than anything and soggy at the bottom. The meatballs were just weird. There was also no attempt to refill the food in a timely manner. The chicken wings were completely out and the fruit was close to getting to that point (keep in mind, I arrived at the start of the event). Overall, I thought the event was a success, so wouldn't hesitate to return here. They just need to improve the food service.","stars":4.0}

Their chees =steaks are correct, they don't resemble a poboy and they are not flavored with tony c's or another other nonsense for that matter. BREAD, CHOPPED STEAK, ONIONS, PEPPERS, CHESSE AND PLENTY OF GREASE! Just they way they should be. \n\nThis is where I will go when I fwant a cheesesteak or just need some real red sauce (none of this watered down sugary nonsense that passes at most places in nola).\n\nOh yeah, if you can't deal with this place because it isn't 'up to code' then don't bother ever going to Philadelphia let alone trying to eat at a place that will make you real pizza.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"No giving u water, relaxation room is pointless, massage is NOT an hour long, constant sounds of tiny lotion bottle lids being opened and shut and the sound of lotion squirting out, no hot towels, no initial relaxation pressure to get you relaxed and if this place does anything for u, they act like they are really doing you a favor.  They just don't get it that customers are the ones doing them a favor by choosing to spend their money at this place of business rather than somewhere else.  It isn't a partnership, it's a service.  If I pay you, YOU WORK FOR ME!   That is what the service industry is!  The costumer experience is the most important part of your business.  Everything else is a cost.  It seems people have forgotten this.  Managers, therapists, buildings, supplies.  You are all costs that without loyal customers, will soon be finding yourself out of business and unemployed.  If you think corporate isn't brainstorming ideas to keep customers, even the ones who might be going outside of the contract a bit, you are kidding yourself.  They probably ask how many contract renewals you get.  Going above and beyond is expected if you want my business.  It's my hard earned money that I have to sweat for and I choose where to spend it.  Why would I just give it to someplace for a low class customer experience.  Some people have to work 8 hours to afford 1 hour here.  They just don't seem to understand that here.  My husband bought a membership for me for my birthday.  He's a man.  They don't pay much attention.  I didn't start using it right away and the third from the last message they wanted me to pay for!!  Apparently, you MUST use 6 massages within 6 months.  I was obviously surprised.  The manager agreed after throwing the contract in my face to extend me 30 days for the other two.  So 3 massages in 30 days.  I only wish I had that time.  Here's the crappy part.  The manager says, your husband was supposed to tell you.  Let me be clear. Bad business practice:  sell gift membership and never go over contract or rules with gift recipient when they first come in, then throw contract in recipients face and act like you are doing them a favor if you extend 30 days (bearing in mind you have been paid in advance).  Good business practice (AKA not what happened):  Explain terms of contract and all expectations to both customer at time of purchase, and recipient upon activating membership, which is not activated until recipient comes in for first massage, therefore creating known expectations and avoiding confusion relying on information or anything else getting from one person to another.  Main point being, don't go here if you have high expectations.  I apologize for any typos as I am writing this from my phone.","stars":1.0}

My husband stated we should try this Greek restaurant sometime, and I disagreed because I felt 'real greek' food could only be available in Tarpon Springs. \n\nA couple behind us over heard us and said 'the food is fresh, nothing frozen, and we should give it a try'.  Well I said I thought Tarpon would be better, but we were meeting people at Tijuana Flats so eating there that night was out of the question. My husband said maybe we would try it at some point, but then the gentleman said he needed to fully disclose to us he was the OWNER!!  He asked us to come in and receive a card for food at a later time. \n\nWe took him up on his offer and returned for a gyro and feta fries.  We could have had anything on the menu, but we wanted to compare with what we like the most in Greek food. Simply delicious!  The gyro was BETTER than most in Tarpon. The gyro meat was not greasy at all. The gyro was served whip what appeared to be homemade chips. And then there was the feta fries, they were wonderful!

{"text":"Had a great experience. Excellent dim sum.\n\nGot there just as the restaurant opened at 10:00AM on a Saturday, so we were seated immediately. By 10:45AM, the restaurant was pretty full (so getting there a bit early is a good idea).\n\nI thought the dim sum was as good as any I have had in California or in New York. One tip for the early arrivers, pace yourself, because the dish variety picked up about 30 minutes after opening. Everything we got was good.\n\nThe service was pretty good for dim sum, and they came frequently. I think a key was our table. It was close to the kitchen, the waiters passed our table twice, going up one side and down the other. They understood our mix of Chinese and English, and ordering was no problem.\n\nWould definitely go back again.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"One of only two Market District locations with a full service bar and restaurant there is so much to like about this grocery.  You can find everything from the basics to high end meats and cheeses and everything in-between.  During my most recent visit I was in search of peppered beef which a friend said was available in their deli.  Alas I found out that this was not true.   While at the deli I noticed that they had several house made selections so I purchased some Smoked Turkey Breast and Roast Beef...both were very tasty and had a much lower sodium content than the norm for deli meats.  \n     If you visit between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. their specialty meat case is open for business.  I purchased Sopressata, Prosciutto Di Parma, Serrano Boneless Ham and Pepper Salame as well as a selection of cheeses for a charcuterie plate...yum...definitely higher end items than you normally find in grocery delis!  My next stop was the bakery where I found my favorite Almond Cake (which they also serve in their restaurant Table by Market District), their special bread of the month Cheesy Pepperoni and Coconut Chocolate Chip Almond cookies.  \n     For those who like beer, wine and\/or cocktails there is a separate area where you can find a wide variety of spirits and bar ware which was on my \"in search of\" list.  Ideally I would have liked to have purchased a cocktail shaker set with matching pieces -- which they did not have but there was a nice selection of coordinating items to choose from.  I scored a stainless steel cocktail shaker, a double jigger, strainer, zester\/knife, muddler and spoon.  \n     On my way to the checkout I stumbled upon the candy aisle where I discovered several retro sweets including my old favorite...the tri colored coconut bars!!!  AND they serve a variety of gelatos...not sure if the gelato is made in house but had to try out the Pistachio which hit the spot.  \n     During my next visit I will have to explore Market District's \"normal\" offerings including their organic produce offerings and see how their prices and variety of items compare to my go to groceries closer to home.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Oh my effin' eff, seriously.  Before coming to Chutney Company, I hadn't had a wada in FIVE WHOLE YEARS.  I was so excited when I walked into this place and looked at the menu that, no joke, I ordered the wada appetizer, samosa appetizer (both to split with my husband), and idli appetizer with sambar.  My hubby also got a chutney wrap (we didn't realize that the chutney wraps are American-style).  Everything was really good.  I actually don't think I've ever had idli\/sambar at a restaurant before and I was shocked that it was under $5.  Even though the idli\/sambar is considered an appetizer and side, it was actually the size of a whole meal, with three medium-sized idlis and a cup of sambar.  I wish we'd tried the dosa as well, but that'll happen next time.\n\nThe wada appetizer was also three wadas.  I'm surprised that Katherine got three of those huge samosas when she ordered the appetizer.  We ordered the same one and only got two (super huge and super filling).  It's possible though that they're still revising the menu... I know they are planning on doing delivery in a few weeks as well.\n\nAnyway, now that I'm done with all that scatterbrained excitement, here are my basic feelings and rationale for the four stars:\n\n1. availability of idli, sambar, wada, dosa\n2. price, quickness of service, friendliness of staff\n3. ambiance -- it's cute and clean; big windows; lots of color on the walls\/floor\/furniture\n4. general tastiness and freshness of food\n\nI took away a star because I felt like somethings could have tasted a little better.  A big one for me is the chutneys.  Many reviewers say that the chutneys are excellent; we got the cilantro, coconut, and mango chutneys and all were decent but not incredible.  I was especially disappointed by the coconut chutney, which was excessively watery.  I could be slightly biased because my mom's chutney is out of this world...  either way, I can't wait to go back!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Went here for my parents 40th wedding anniversary and will not be returning. It started with showing up for a reservation and we only had a party of 6 and was told that they had no table large enough to accommodate us so we would have to wait for one of the other tables to leave. After 30 minutes past our reservation after seeing everyone coming in after us being sat we were offered an outdoor table as this was the only accommodation they could have for us. The hosts were very nice about this but never once heard from the manager. We sat outside and had to wait 10-15 minutes once all drinks at our table were empty for the waiter to come back and acknowledge our drinks were empty and asked if we wanted refills. When it came to the food that was also very underwhelming. 5 of our sides except for the cauliflower were all Luke warm or cold by the time we got them. I got the lamp chops and I could barely even cut through them there was so much fat and gristle. When I showed\/ told the waiter his only response was \"oh really? That's normally one of the better entrees\".  Again no acknowledgement from the manager. We also were never offered dessert and was just given the bill instead.

{"text":"Sticky. If I needed to describe this particular location of Chickie's & Pete's in one word, it would be Sticky. From the floors to the table and menus, to the doors of the restrooms, everything is sticky. I can't say if it's due to lack of cleaning, which causes these surfaces and items to be sticky. Or maybe it's because everything is wood, and nobody has been properly trained on cleaning techniques for wood surfaces. Either way, this location leaves a lot to be desired. We've been here a few times, when we have a crab fry craving. Living in Lower Bucks county, could either go to this Bordentown location or the Roosevelt Blvd. location, both are equidistant from our residence. Having said that, we visited Bordentown twice within six months and both times we weren't 100% satisfied with the food, atmosphere, or service. A lot does have to do with the cleanliness of the restaurant, but the service isn't great and the crab fries could have been more flavored. Didn't have enough crab\/ old bay spices. We've dined here twice as I mentioned, once on a weekend and once during the week, both for dinner, it wasn't crowded at all. For me that's a telltale sign that this isn't a popular location OR they just don't like it's stickiness.","stars":2.0}

Russo's caters my workplace a few days per week and have catered our holiday meals with the standard Thanksgiving\/Christmas fare, which is pretty enjoyable. I don't often get their catered food or get entrees at all (except for the free holiday catering provided by my employer), as I don't eat much while working, but I really like their chicken and dumpling soup and gooey butter cake. I was disappointed with the limited cafe selection and atmosphere. I went at lunch time on one of my vacation days with a family member to give it a try, since weekday lunch is the only time it's open. The cafe (and the dessert case) was almost totally empty, and it also gave a dark, decrepit feeling. I had fish tacos, and my relative had the fish with couscous (or rice? Can't remember for sure). I believe hers was a special of the day.

{"text":"This is probably one of the best Indian Restaurants I've been to, and by far the best in Nashville.   I'm pretty much a vegetarian (although the occasional hot dog seems to slip through my security zone every now and then) so this is right up my ally.   \n\nThe staff seems friendly, and I've never really had to wait much whenever I've been there, albeit I haven't gotten the chance to go there for their lunch buffets.  The place seems clean as well.  The waiting area is a bit small, but since I haven't had to wait there much, doesn't seem to be much of a problem.  \n\nThe food is amazingly good if you like Indian food, and the varying degrees of to which they can adjust spice comes in really handy if you have a sensitive tongue.  The Dosa here is excellent and so are the Aloo Paratha.  They have plenty of choices as well, and almost all of them seem good.  I've tried various dosas, appetizers (samosa, pakora, vada, etc), curries, parathas, naan,  poori, and bhatura's, and they all seem to be really good.  I don't think I've ever really been disappointed going here.   \n\nThe only possible negative that I can think of is the parking.  It's basically on the side of an apartment building, right besides 440, so parking can get tough especially if it's the weekend.  There is parking in the back, but I believe some of it is reserved for the apartment building, so that can get tricky.  \n\nThis is one of those places that people will keep returning because the prices aren't exorbitant (nor are they particularly cheap) but the food is amazing.   I recommend this place to pretty much anyone that likes vegetarian Indian food.  Pretty much when my gf or parents come to visit Nashville, they always make atleast one trip here. \n\nAnd last but not least, controversial advice from my parents:  Judge an ethnic restaurant by how many people of that ethnicity visit it and\/or are seen when you visit.  I'd say this passes that benchmark, although it's skewed because I visit it often, :D","stars":5.0}
{"text":"It's a nice atmosphere with a great selection of wines. Since it was our first time visiting this restaurant, my friend and I opted for tapas\/small plates versus a large meal. The food was delicious. We had the daily flat bread, a sampling of meats and cheeses, bruschetta, and a salad. I forget the bottle of red wine I ordered, but it was fantastic and not overly priced for a restaurant. The only downside was it was really noisy and crowded. There was a Sweet Sixteen event upstairs which sounded as if a bunch of cattle were stampeding over our heads. Additionally, we were seated at a table in the right next to a booth with very little room in between. The host (manager perhaps?) must have known the person seated in the booth next to us because he talked to them for some time with his rear end faced towards us. Not a bad view, but not something I would like to see while I'm enjoying a meal. I will most likely visit Teca again to try their happy hour or check out the upstairs section. I hear it offers higher class than most of the bars since the prices are generally much higher than what the average college student can afford in the area.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Disaster from start to finish. 8 of us for dinner. For apps we had the meat and cheese board and mussels. Mussels were delicious. Meat and cheese board we ordered the larger board, 5 of each. About 15 minutes after we ordered the manager came to our table and asked if they could split it into 2 boards since we were a larger table. That's fine. Instead of 'splitting' it as she said they bring us two of the smaller 3 cheese\/ meat boards and then charged us the $20 for each of them instead of the 5 cheese\/ meat for $25. Half hour later dinners start arriving. 3 arrive. 10 minutes go by and another 2 arrive. Another 10 minutes and 2 more. The 8th and final? My cousins pizza never arrived. My food was bland, my moms over cooked, my aunts had been sitting under the heat lamp so long her cheese sauce was now so rubbery it had to be cut with a knife. My cousin ordered stuffed chicken breast, the toothpick stuffed inside was an extra surprise! When we brought this to the managers attention we were told they don't use toothpicks in the kitchen. :\/ in the end they did remove the chicken from the bill. To end the evening we asked them to split the bill evenly between two credit cards, they split it and ran it on the same card twice. The poor food, the rude manager, the 3 hour weeknight dinner when it was practically empty?! They're only getting two stars because our waitress was lovely","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I have to say that I understand they are there to SELL me something, to be given so much false information is horrible and misleading.  We waited in line for 1 full hour and then were with the rep for another hour and a half.  \n\nThe reps were busy which is why we waited assuming it meant when it was our turn that we would get good service, and we thought it was ok.  Told me I could get a discount through my work (20% off) went over what the first bill should look like and when it was due.  Asked us about purchasing insurance but for the device it wasn't really needed and at 10$ plus tax more a month not worth it.  The rep made a \"joke\" that he gets more commission if he puts it on there.  I was put off by some of it but at the end of all the \"selling\" it sounded like a great deal.  We paid over $100.00 for the device with the promise our bill, without any overages, would be about $45.00 a month.  Great moved on with my lifer 48 hours!\n\nAs the next two days unfolded I found that the billing cycle was actually 8 days sooner then the rep promised.  Found out he put the insurance on the bill even though we declined, guess he wanted that commission!  Found out he put the data cap that we explained we didn't need as we would monitor usage ourselves was put on for an additional fee.  Then I found out I could NOT use my discount on the device and the rate would be 20$ more a month. Needless to say we were upset. \n\nAfter calling the 800# several times and being told several different things we decided it was way too scary and we became unsure about how our 2 year contract would be a nightmare.  I am returning the item today and expect a full refund, the toll Fee number verified we are eligible.\n\nHonestly, I expect a little \"sales\" in the sale but to mislead your customer or not be informed of your own companies policies and procedures is just inexcusable.  I am very disappointed with this store and the sales rep in particular.  I wont name him publicly but I will say that I will never patronize any sprint product ever due to his misconduct.  \n\nAs the other reviewer stated the attitude of the staff in general there seems to be indifferent and borderline rude\/snarky.

Warm, flaky, sweet, sticky, crunchy, and altogether perfect.  Topped with roasted almonds, and devoid of that \"fake almond\" flavor, it really hits the spot like none other.

{"text":"I have been moved by half a dozen professional moving companies over the past ten years, both in and out of storage facilities, and directly from home to home, so I have a pretty good idea of what to expect.  Usually there is one item broken, a couple of dings and scratches, and although it is always disappointing, that is par for the course.This was the worst experience I have ever had.  Initially we thought this company was great, as our landlord changed our move-out deadline halfway through our move, and they did hustle to get us out on time.  However, they also arrived almost two hours late.  I didn't care so much at the time, but they had been warned it was a big move and we were employing them for packing as well as moving, so it did really hurt us when the landlord moved the time of the move up that they had shown up so late, and it bothered me that the reason was that \"the guys were tired from their moves the day before.\"  Still, they told us not to worry, they would stay as long as it took to do the job right.  I was disappointed after they moved our things into a storage unit to discover that many things I had asked to be saved had been trashed, and that the storage unit was packed so poorly, but I was still grateful for the hustle after the deadline changed, and so I booked them to move us out of the storage unit and in to our new apartment as well.  Once I started unpacking, I discovered many, many items missing and broken, and two pieces of furniture rendered totally unusable -- a beautiful, heavy desk that is completely unstable now because the brace to steady the legs is just missing, and a Lazyboy recliner that is bent out of shape such that the top of the chair no longer fits into the grooves between the arms.  You fall out if you try to sit in the chair.  The owner of the company refused to call me back and finally e-mailed me to say that the items that were missing must have been taken by someone on the street when they were rushing to and from to get us out on time (untrue -- I saw the items in question in our storage unit before the second move and told him so), and that if I was unhappy with their service I should sue and he would see me in court.  There was no apology, no offer to have the brace on the desk replaced or any of the broken items repaired, and no response to my questions in reply.  I give this company one star for packing some large fragile items very well and for hustle.  I am sad to have about a half dozen items to re-frame, a few prints that are now totally beyond repair, a lamp that I loved just missing, dishes and other items broken, and two expensive pieces of furniture rendered unusable.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.","stars":1.0}

I walked in to grab a bite to eat while my mom was getting a hair cut next door. I walked in but there was no one standing at the counter but when I got up to the counter there was a lady and she was doing some type of cleaning or prep work she knew I was standing  there but she didn't acknowledge me or say say hi for a good 30 seconds or so. Finally when she said hi very dreadfully and asked me what i wanted. I told her a very basic order and she didn't even bother to look at me and she had to ask me again what i wanted. A younger gentlemen helped me out at the register and he was very nice and sweet, no problems there. I went to sit down and noticed that there was clutter everywhere. There was a half a bagel and drink sitting on the table next to me, there were crumbs everywhere on the floor. The trash bin had paper liners scattered on the top of it and tables seemed to not be wiped down. It was super quiet I only saw one customer in there besides me and one that came in for a brief second and then left. It just seemed like such a dreadful place and the employees didn't seem happy. tHe customer service was ok and the cleanliness was not up to par. The food I got was ok, it was kind of stale and chewy. And one last thing, the lady asked me if i wanted my bagel toasted and she never did toast it. That is why it was chewy. She did nothing that I really wanted besides throw a bagel and cheese together. The only thing that made it nice was when I left the guy noticed me leaving and told me to have a good day.

My go to was what was inexplicably called the Suzie Sorority (Steve, please, explain that....) which was turkey and havarti with lettuce and tomato. As deli meats go, a somewhat healthy choice. Always had an Arnold Palmer with it, and mind you this seriously pre-dates the actual naming ANYTHING an Arnold Palmer. Back then it was just a tea\/lemonade mix. So the SD is now updated, cleaner and about $4 more per sandwich. Oh, and they have beer now. Time marches on! One last thing. Back in the day they had one of my all-time favorite cartoons.

{"text":"So I rolled in here for some takeout tacos after a show at the Pageant. The little takeout counter is very cute and the woman working was super nice. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends.\n\nHave you seen that website where they show the advertised fast food photo next to the real thing? The beautiful hamburger with glistening lettuce and tomatoes on the perfect bun compared to the sideways smashed road kill looking burger with random sauces oozing out? It was kind of like that. When I opened my box, all the toppings had fallen off and were in a little jumbled piles. I tried to resurrect my tacos using online descriptions. But sadly, my tacos were a mere shell (pun intended) of the ones promised in the menu. \n\nI ordered the grilled fish taco and the duck taco. Per the menu, the fish taco is supposed to come with fish, sauce, cabbage, pico de gallo, and queso fresco. I got fish (thank God for that), about 3 shreds of cabbage and maybe a quarter of a cherry tomato. My sauce was ordered on the side. No queso to speak of. It was basically a sad little piece of fish all alone in a tortilla. \n\nThe duck taco is supposed to have duck, pork belly, avocado, and sauce. This one fared slightly better, but still no avocado. I'm not 100% sure about the pork belly either, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that one. \n\nLooking at even the Yelp photos of beautiful tacos in the cute little taco holder made me feel even worse. I'll have to try dining in next time. Yeah, so I ordered takeout and didn't check my food. Rookie mistake. But, I gave Mission more credit than that.","stars":3.0}

This place is small and very dark, even during lunch. It's more of a bar scene, and I suggest ordering your food to-go. There aren't many tables, which helps with social distancing, but there's just not a lot of set-up to support a dine-in experience overall. \n\nThe food is excellent, however. You order at the counter and they'll call your number when your food is ready. Birria tacos are stuffed with shredded meat, dipped in stew, and then the taco shell is fried on a grill. You dip the taco in a small cup of the meat stew and enjoy! I loved the melted cheese inside the taco. The stew is very flavorful and intensifies the richness of the Birria taco.\n\nTacos Las Californias is a bit of a drive from where I live, so I don't know if I would go back to this restaurant specifically.

{"text":"Came here for the first time with a friend over the weekend, and had a great time. I called ahead to see if they had any specials, and Emanual said not to worry and just come in and ask for him! So we did. He happily gave us complimentary drinks and chips and salsa! \n\nAtmosphere: VERY casual. This is clearly a place where families can come and have a relaxing meal with children. You can also come without kids, but that just shows you the kind of family-friendly environment this place is. The table next to us had 2 kids, and the kids meals came in frisbees as plates. The waitress cleaned both with a disinfectant wipe at the end of the meal and gave them to the kids to play with. THAT is truly AMAZING service. You have to order at the front and sit yourself, but food comes out to your table. Its a blend of fast-cas and restaurant service.\n\nFood:  We had the chips and salsa, nachos, and the corn. All three were great, salsas were differently and delicious. The portions were HUGE. Definitely order 1 entree between two people with a side of something else.\n\nDrinks: Their soda machine has soda made with cane sugar. It was interesting,   I am not used to the taste so I still prefer a coke or pepsi with corn syrup haha. \n\nService: Great service, quick, efficient. Very friendly staff all around!\n\nPro tip: portions are huge, so maybe start with fewer things and order more as you need.\n\nPro tip #2: ask if there are specials during the week!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"My girlfriend and I stayed here for our 4 year anniversary and it was great! The rooms are not that big, but they do not feel too small. They are cozy and decorated in just the right way to make you feel very comfortable. The hotel is an old one so the size of the room is not a big deal. Also, the doors appear to be old steel doors with big rivets on the hinge. It gives the room a nice historic feel.The bed (King) was extremely comfortable. After unpacking and checking in we headed down to the beach. The beach was great. There are chairs set up that are free to use for guests and some nicer padded lounge chairs that can be rented. A couple in front of us had rented the nice padded chairs and was leaving the beach for the day and offered for us to use them for the rest of the day. The chairs are very comfortable and are in the front row of all the chairs set up, so it has the best view. After the beach we went to the pool, which is not a huge pool, but there are two that provide ample room for all the guests.\n\nAfter our day in the sun we went back to our room and got ready for dinner. We decided to try The Maritana Grille which is located in the Don Cesar. The restaurant is expensive, but the meal was really good. My girlfriend and I both got filets which were good, but the mashed potatoes were made with truffle oil. I guess because this is a more upscale restaurant they decided to make the mashed potatoes a little more fancy, but it kind of ruined them for me. I like regular mashed potatoes and of course garlic, but the truffle oil was really overpowering in them. The dessert was probably the coolest\/best part of the dinner. We got two to share and the first one was a play on smores and was really delicious. The second was a white chocolate and raspberry sorbet egg shell. The server brought out this plate with an egg shell on it standing up right. It was about 5 times the size of a normal egg. He then poured some hot liquid out onto the shell and the shell, which was made out of white chocolate, crumbled before our eyes (we have it on video). This revealed the rest of the dessert and it was quite tasty as well.\n\nPart of our reservation included breakfast for two at their restaurant on the bottom floor near the pool\/beach. Our breakfast was great as well. Overall we had a great time at the Don Cesar and a great anniversary. It may be a little expensive, but is well worth it for special occasions.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"On a visit here to view Terminator Genisys I found that the cul de sac outside of the theater is reserved for handicap parking. Additional parking is nearby for free. There was a long line to purchase tickets as well as snaking concession stand lines. Entry into the theater is a single aisle and no matter where you sit, someone is gonna try and slide by you or you'll be teetering by to get to your seat. Would be great if there were aisles on each sides so that there is an easier transition to\/from your seat. No complaints on the seats I found.\nUpon exiting the theater, I went to to the ladies room right outside and of course there was a line for the 3 stalls and 10 women\/girls waiting. One of the stalls was out of order and I went to the restroom in the entry\/game area. More stalls in this one but I was totally miffed when I went to wash my hands and there was grey water stagnant in the sink. I brought it to the manager's attention and he seemed a bit nonchalant about  me reporting it and gave me some scripted blurb about how they're working on it. Other areas of the bathroom needed some attention but I really wasn't in the mood for another rehearsed spiel.\nSome of the workers were a wee bit too familiar with one another but there are a few who were attentive and performing their duties as required. For the gaming area, you have to buy a card and load money onto it as it's the only way to play the games. If you are a one time visitor, it may not be a  logical choice to load money onto a card and hope to use it all in one visit.","stars":3.0}

Oh and also our waitress threatened to \"call the cops\" if we didn't pay for our meal! :) Classy!... Never ever eat here. Awful food and service.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as it has a good variety of vegan dishes at a decent price. Sabrina's Cafe is usually my go to for lunch, but it's nice to find a place that has tasty, and fresh food at a cheaper cost. It's also BYOB which is a ++. The exterior needs work, but I get the feeling that they are still finalizing construction inside and outside. My party of 4 arrives around 11am on a Saturday, and we are probably only the 6th table in the place so it didn't seem like they had a lot of customers that morning. \n\nThey were out of the steak benedict that someone in my party was really excited to try, and they were out of the Teriyaki Seitan that I tried to order myself. Out of several vegan dishes that were on the menu I was only presented with two options that I could choose from. Disappointing. Mind you the place is only open from 6am to 2pm and halfway through the day at peak brunch hour they are sold out of key items. We weren't the only table being told that a dish was unavailable. So then I choose what may be one of their simplest dishes; cauliflower tacos. The rest of my party gets their food (enchiladas, nawlings skillet, eggs benedict), and I'm told my dish will only be a couple minutes late because they are making it fresh. Oh great, sounds like another dish that wasn't prepped. So about 5-10 minutes goes by as my party is digging into their dish and my three cauliflower tacos are still not ready. I have to get up, find my server, and he apologetically repeats that it's being made fresh. So basically that was another dish that wasn't prepped this morning or they already ran out of and they didn't want to tell us about a third unavailable dish. About 5 more minutes after that I get my tacos. Mind you that these don't even come with a side of rice and beans, but as I now live in LA I just chalked it up to being $3 per taco. The taste was....ok. It wasn't worth a 15 minute wait AFTER the rest of my party had been served. Oh and also a side of breakfast potatoes we initially ordered was forgotten about several times and didn't come out until 5 minutes after I received my food. The skillet lacked in its protein, and looked pretty sad. The benedict was \"not hot\" according to my MIL, but my SIL really liked the taste of her enchiladas.\n\nThere was no manager making the rounds to see if service was up to par which I'm used to especially with a new restaurant [ETA: Wow, this place isn't even THAT new], and our server didn't even offer a discount for the unaccepted wait time. This place could be something, but I get turned off very quickly when a kitchen is unprepared and there's a lack of hospitality.","stars":2.0}

We were greeted with a smile when we walked in. \nThe atmosphere is what you'd expect. Not overly German, but subtle and relaxed.  No loud annoying music like the Hofbraeuhaus.  \nThe menu looks easy and navigable.  \nI went for the 'jugular', being the name 'Berlin's Doener', so thats what I ordered.  Overall, lets just say they try and talking to the lady who owns the place I see that they are open to get it right eventually.  I wouldn't let the doener pass as authentic today and most likely not in 2 weeks.  However, you always draw a sketch first to get a picture.  Having said that, I really hope that the owners will take another close look at some of the 'must have ingredients ' (especially sauces that should be available like they are at any doener place in Berlin).  I also gave her a few tips on the bread, which I know is hard to duplicate.  Try to enrich the water you use for baking with minerals, and you get a much better outcome. \nOverall, a nice place to try and next time I come back, I will dig into the currywurst, another super popular snack in Berlin.  (PS:  try to blend the curry sauce you have.

Our waitress was rarely to be seen, and another food runner finally brought our meal, and ran off without asking if we needed anything. I had to wait again for condiments when our waitress finally made an appearance. No apologies for the long wait, she was just cluless. Also, they charge $2.79 for coffee,and $2.79 for a refill.

We were curious after passing it several times on our way back and forth from trips to Tampa from Orlando. \n\nWe took our 3 year old daughter who has taken an interest in dinosaurs recently. She thoroughly enjoyed her time spent at the playground, and even wanted to tour the indoor Dino museum five times (thank you, air conditioning!!). Masks are to be worn in the playground areas, gift shops, and indoor museum. \n\nThere is an outdoor Dino exhibit to walk through and there are signs with the dinosaurs names in front for educational purposes. We loved walking around the park and talking about the different types of dinosaurs, what they ate, and how they may have sounded. \n\nThe weather was nice but hot. You are allowed to bring in your own cooler with food and drinks as there isn't a concession stand or food or drinks sold on property. There are plenty of picnic tables under shaded areas surrounding the park and playgrounds. \n\nThe fossil dig area was closed to do Covid , and was an extra charge on top of the park ticket price. \n\nThis place is great to have a Dino themed birthday party or to take your favorite dinosaur fan to have a fun day.","stars":4.0}

Yes, it is what I grew up eating and clearly their bagels are hand-crafted.  I grabbed a half-dozen onion bagels because they looked sooooo good.  I also picked out another half-dozen assorted bagels which mostly came from the sweet varieties.\n\nAbout the onion bagels: they were absolute perfection.  This may be the first place I've found where they add the minced onions to the top and the bottom of the bagel in such a way that you basically have two tops.  Pure genius!\n\nWhy only 4 stars?

{"text":"Just bought a 2015 chevy equinox with 50k miles on it.. happy with the vehicle and was happy with the customer service of sales consultant Michael H., APR is high though even with a co-signer with excellent credit and a little bit of a down payment. Was not happy with the customer service of a manager named Greg over the phone. A couple days after purchasing the vehicle i noticed a squeeking noise while going over speedbumps. Called and made an appointment for an inspection. Also noticed the tires obviously need a rotation. (Front tires much more bald than back tires). Took it for the inspection and they drove it around the block and it wouldnt make the squeeking noise because there are no speed bumps around the store. But they didnt inspect anything... and they said they checked the tires and they are still up to \"carmax standard\" so they didnt do a rotation. I watched them walk up to the vehicle, get right in and drive around the block came back parked it and came right back inside without even looking at the tires. How'd they check the tires without looking at them? Getting back home the vehicle of course squeeks as i pull over a speed bump. So now i gotta call again and make another inspection appointment... and probably pay for a tire rotation even though I just purchased the vehicle... not happy with the service center.","stars":2.0}

It's a fun karaoke bar that can get a little rowdy, but I enjoyed it because the upstairs wasn't packed yet and we were able to snag a couple small tables and sit upstairs and drink and watch the performers below (upstairs has an indoor balcony that overlooks the stage). It didn't set off my clautrophobia, didn't make me feel unsafe, AND we even went downstairs and participated a song. It was nice to be able to go and enjoy it qithout being too crowded, and on top of that the drinks were large and weren't overpriced like most tourist traps in the French Quarter!

TANGO is a stylish new spot that hasn't opened yet and I was invited by some friends to check the spot out.  First there is a extremely well dressed doorman to greet you when you enter TANGO, upon entering the place, its very modern and fresh. The building is very long and narrow, it must run about 200 feet deep. It start with a long red acrylic bar, there are some tables and booths,  followed by a huge, open kitchen. \n We sat at the bar and a beautiful friendly young lady named Tikki greeted us and she was so sweet and her outfit conjured up all the Mystikal secrets of Asian women. Assisting her at the bar was Jose and the two of them try their hardest to please everyone and they succeeded with style. I ordered a bottle of orchid Apple cider and some Thai crispy chicken wings with a dipping sauce.  They were very fresh and delicious and the crunch was intense.\n I went upstairs to check out the club portion of the restaurant and Wow! Upstairs there was a huge bar with 3 bartenders, 6 karaoke rooms complete with a hostess and bottle service. I counted 37 huge flat screen TVs with a huge projection screen that doubled as a huge window overlooking Arch Street. All the karaoke equipment was state of art and everyone seem to be having such a great time.

I was the only person in the store and yet it took 30 minutes for me to get my order. I'm not sure why it would take 30 minutes to put avocado on toast but it was especially irritating because there was no sense of urgency.

I would hold off on tipping until after you receive your order to make sure you enjoy your service, because that only makes sense.","stars":3.0}

I was told over the phone that my order would be ready in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my food.  I was never asked for my name or phone number when I placed my order.  When I arrived the young woman who I know took my order asked \"did you leave a name by chance?\" I said no.  Then she asked what I ordered and I told her.  She then went to back of the restaurant to another cash register and STAYED back there for 10 minutes.  So eventually I asked the man at the front of the restaurant (who I assume was the manager) if he knew what was going on with my order.  He said he did not know but he would check on it in a minute. The young woman finally came back to the front of the store (not for me however) and the manager asked where was my order because he was trying to find it in the system.  She said she didn't know because she didn't take my order (which was not true).  Then they both went to the back of the restaurant.  The manager comes back and says \"I found out what happened, she never put your order in but she just put it in for you right now\". WHAT?!?!

She indulged my bridezilla-ness (or kept me from getting there) every step of the way. We committed to the Mazarin 15 months before our wedding day and at no point did I wish I had picked another place. \nIt was important to us that we have our wedding at a place that was \"New Orleansy\" since most of our guests were from out of town. I didn't want to do it at a place that could have been in any other city. The gorgeous climate-controlled courtyard (w\/retractable canopy in case of rain!) was the perfect spot for our ceremony. Our florist decorated the fountain beautifully with candles and when we departed for our post-ceremony second line, they flipped the courtyard so it was now the perfect space for our cocktail hour. The reception room itself (La Louisiane) was set up beautifully, and the bar area is the most gorgeous part of the room with the exposed brick and gas lamps. There is no mistake that when you are at Hotel Mazarin, you are in New Orleans!\nThe food was wonderful and the space was perfect for our six piece band. We had 110 guests and provided open seating for about 90 which I thought was perfect. Plenty of dance floor space!\nWe also had a personal attendant.

The availability of flavors are unique and aren't too \"vanilla\" (pun intended) aka the usual. \n\nAtmosphere of the place is nice, well lit. Unfortunately if there's a lot of people it can get crowded and confusing on where you can order. Seating is limited. And music is on the louder side, so if you don't want to feel like you're yelling, take your dessert to go. \n\nSome individuals complained it was pricey at 7$, but I see it this way it's a new concept not many cities including my hometown of LA has taken off with yet.

Half the  ingredients are actually grown or made locally, so you know that the food is amazing and as fresh as it gets. (not to mention you are supporting local businesses, so yay).  My favorite thing on the lunch menu is the Mediterranean Sandwich.  It's amazing and huge and quite the deal for the price you pay (around $6 for a sandwich, not bad).  The salad selection is excellent as well and when I am feeling the desire to be \"good\" I often opt for this route.  The best thing about this place is how heavily vegetarian the menu is.  While there are some carnivorous items on the menu, the vast majority of the things are items any veggie could (and would want to) eat.  This is so rare in a lunch time restaurant that I immediately fell in love upon my first read of the menu.  \n\nI love how much this neighborhood is coming along and this is one more addition to it.

I typically don't use the drive thru because I bring by own thermos (and then you will have to wait till you get to the window to give it to them for them to make your coffee.  I used to get bagels there, but they would toast them on a panini grill, which was terrible, but I don't think they do that any more, but I don't know for sure, because I got cheap and started buying my bagels or muffins at Trader Joe's now.  One important but often overlooked note ... the help is always friendly.  One comment though ... watching the people prepare the espresso grinds, the probably waste a good third of them.

No Tomato soup, no nothing special. Just plain grilled cheese and plain sweet potato fries. \n\nAfter 45 minutes, the risk of getting written up for coming back from lunch late, the fact that i wouldn't get to try \"The Granny\" and the Fries with Bleu Cheese, quit and went hungry.

They have a deal that is three rolls, 4 pieces of sushi and an appetizer and IF you are still hungry then you can pay another $2 and get the all you can eat. I have never made it that far. As far as taste, I haven't tried a ton of rolls there, but what I have tried has been my favorite of the other sushi places in West County (ish area). The service is always very good, friendly staff. The restaurant as a whole is a little small (cause it's usually crowded at dinner) the tables could be a little nicer and more comfortable but they work fine for dinner. \n\nThe only real complaint I have about Sushi Ai is their coupons, I was hoping to save a few bucks while still enjoying my fav sushi, but the coupons are VERY confusing, they don't have fine print that tells you when you can and can't use a coupon and our waitress had to try and explain it to us and when we still couldn't understand (partially due to language barrier but mostly due to the fact that it was really confusing) the hostess came over and tried to explain it (I still didn't get it) So I think IF they are going to offer coupons on their website, they need to make them more clear.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I went to the Sidecar Bar for the first time today, and I had a pretty good experience. The server approached us immediately when we sat down to take our drink order and give us menus. I guess I came on a good day, because their tap list was really great. Included were the Bell's Cherry Stout, the Southern Tier Unearthly IPA (one of my personal favorites), Founder's Breakfast Stout (amazing), the Avery 15 (sounds better than it is, unfortunately), and the Smuttynose Smuttonator (which our waiter said was a Belgian ale, but is actually a Doppelbock). I wonder if the waiter was new, because he seemed a little all over the place. However, he did manage to get our orders correct at least. The beers, although delicious, came in tiny glasses for $6. They definitely could have been $1 or $1.50 cheaper.\n\nMy turkey burger was a little on the dry side, but spicy and pretty flavorful, although it needed salt. The fries were pretty good, but I was trying to avoid them. I split cornbread with my boyfriend, and it was nowhere near as good as Good Dog's. I thought that, overall, the food was just okay. I tried the macaroni and cheese that my roommate and my boyfriend both got, and it was pretty bland. It had potential to be good, but it lacked that delicious mac-and-cheese flavor and needed salt (seems to be a running theme). \n\nThe server came back often to check on things and returned quickly with refills and additional drinks. I thought the service was good, except for the misinformation about the beer (really, he should know the styles of the beers they serve). I want to give the Sidecar three-and-a-half stars overall, but because of the okay food and the pricey beer, it really doesn't deserve a four.","stars":3.0}

In a party of two, four tapas would have been enough.\n\nSangria was meh and came pre-made from a bottle. \n\nI had the Casa Ceviche which had shrimp, scallops, squid, market fish, garlic, cilantro, Spanish onions, tomatoes and peppers. I love ceviche and this one was delicious. It's a little small, as you would expect from a tapa dish, but I would order it again.\n\nOMG get the Queso de Cabra!!! Baked spiced goat cheese, piquant tomato sauce, basil, evoo, grilled flat bread. Nice heat which gets you respiring quickly but not enough to sweat... very savory and addicting. I have low spice tolerance and despite constantly reaching for more sangria I kept coming back for more. \n\nRabo de Toro was braised oxtail in red wine and saffron rice. It was very tender, but nothing special about the flavor. It was kind of plain. I feel that oxtail has such great potential for flavor but this one was a little disappointing.\n\nCalamares Fritas were standard fried squid, with shishito peppers, parmesan and house aioli. It was pretty average (as in typical of restaurants in flavor and texture) but satisfying. Good if you like fried calamari and a \"safe\" dish.\n\nGambas al Ajillo were good: saut\u00e9ed shrimp, garlic, onions, chilies, sherry and brandy. Really great flavor. Again, kind of a small portion, but it is a tapas place. Would order again.\n\nOverall the plates were better than average, three and a half stars.

{"text":"First time dined at Stella Rossa on 3\/29\/14 with another couple.  I am glad that we had made reservations, because there was an 1-1\/2 hour wait, as very large parties showed up earlier.  Since we arrived before our reserved time, we sat at the bar for a drink.  The bartender was very pleasant and attentive.  However, my biggest shock of the night came early, as the tab for 2 7oz glasses of wine were $21 (and these were the house wines)!  Since this was my first visit, I was beginning to dread the price of the meals.\n\nOur table was ready on-time, and our waitress was great -- very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive.  We started with an antipasto of cheeses and meats.  Although good, it was extremely light for 4 people.  I had the baked rigatoni which came with pepperoni and sausage.  It was really good, and filling.  The sauce was OK, but not bad.  Others had the lobster ravioli special.  Looking at their plates, I assume they loved it since there was little left over.\n\nSince we were all full, we passed on the desserts.\n\nThe restaurant is very noisy, but I expected that.  It is a nice environment, which will be more enjoyable when the weather improves and you can be outside.  We will certainly return.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I wanted to like Noodles and Company, truly I did. Most of my wife's favorite foods involve noodles in some way or another, so she was very excited about coming.\n\nI came in without preconceived notions, avoiding even reading Yelp before my visit. Visiting on a Sunday around 2:00 pm, my wife and I were both thoroughly underwhelmed by our experience.\n\nFirst, the service had issues. I was ignored by the counter person for a couple of minutes, although he may have assumed we were still making selections. I picked a table for my wife and I and then went to fill my drink at the fountain. While I was filling my drink, my feet were attacked by a carpet-sweeper wielding employee. I moved out of her way and she quickly jumped in front of me, between me and the table, and proceeded to take a very long time to figure out that a carpet sweeper doesn't work very well on a tile floor. I waited patiently for her to finish, which she finally did, after three minutes of me standing waiting for her to let me return to my table. She did not acknowledge my presence at any point during this exchange, even after she ran over my toes. I guess it was my bad for wearing flip-flops.\n\nThe food was nearly as disappointing as the service. My wife's Mac and Cheese was, as Jason S. noted, no better than Kraft, and my Indonesian peanut saute with chicken was an exercise in bland laziness. As an example, the cilantro on top was an entire sprig, I had to pick the leaves off myself. We both had to thoroughly mix our dishes when they arrived at the table, the sauce was quite unevenly applied. The chicken and meatballs were both obviously cooked from frozen. The chicken had that hard, cracked leather outside and dry, chalk-like inside that comes from being unevenly cooked. Even our side Caesar salads were a disappointment. The cheese was some processed blend, not real Parmesan or whatever they claimed it to be. The romaine lettuce was mainly the tough, outer leaves and they were even wilted. It didn't help the salad was served on a plate still hot from the dishwasher.\n\nIn short, I won't be back, and if you value your money and appreciate a good noodle dish, you won't bother going.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I have to say my experience is very similar to Christopher's.  It's been about 9 years since hubby and I stayed there. I, too, was a novice at booking hotels online, and also being in college, I was interested in the cheapness and proximity to the Quarter. It sounded great, on paper. In reality, it was a nightmare.  We went for a few days over New Years, and on our way back after the fireworks at the river, we were 'assaulted' by some of the locals. Apparently we were walking too casually in their turf, because they started throwing firecrackers at us. The day we were leaving, we went out to the parking lot to find our car broken in to. Thankfully we had correctly gauged the neighborhood and taken every thing in to the hotel room. (I have a bit of satisfaction that the thief cut him\/herself on the window glass, because there was blood on our cooler-and they got nothing.) When we went in to tell the desk clerk, he said, \"Oh I know! I saw it!\" He then pointed to the monitor where he had watched the crime take place. This, my friends, is the monitored parking they are so proud of. \nOtherwise, it was a freezing cold room with bare amenities. Dirty, dingy, disgusting on all counts. It's in a very scary neighborhood, and the money you save isn't worth the possible loss of life, limb, and\/or property.  I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy.\nThe only 'positive' thing I can say is that I think the hotel is haunted, because we came back one day to find the door blocked by the nightstand in way that couldn't have been done by someone leaving the room. The door opened about two inches, and we had to push very hard to move the table to get in. Not sure exactly what it was, but we're calling it a ghost because that redeems the experience a bit.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Let me start by setting the scene: my father texted me on 6\/26 letting me know that he hisa wife were coming to Nashville, and though they were staying with friends for the first part of the trip, they would be with us Friday-Sunday. I have a broken foot, our house was a disaster (just two  two lazy humans and 2 dogs weighting a total of 25 pounds together). I looked at my husband and asked if I could try to find someone who could fit in a new client, short notice, during a holiday week (i know, like the holy Grail), he agreed.  So I went to the fastest platform I knew of, even though I HATE the business practices of thumb tack, it's the quickest. Maisas responded quickly, completely sympathetic to my situation and fit us into their schedule.  I've had cleaning services growing up and have always done the \"preclean\". Well, not only was our house not precleaned, my husband thought he would be able to groom our dog's in the guest bathroom... And maybe forgot to clean up ALL OF THEIR FLUFF. So we have cleaners coming into a house that should basically be condemned. On top of all of this, I was at work when they were coming and my husband was home. To say sometimes he isn't the most cordial? For example, he let our Shih-poo and Bichon follow the cleaners around getting in their way, whereas I would have kept them in one room. Just little picky stuff like that.  Even with the disaster they walked into Maisa's went above and beyond. They even made the dog beds (two out of like 11). My husband even let them clean his office- he's never let any other cleaners clean his office.  Needless to say, we have a new monthly cleaning service which is completely amazing! My mother was very impressed that our guest bathrooms had toliet paper roll roses. We moved to Nashville in 2015, we've gone through at least 4 cleaning services, this is the only one I will use for the remainder of our stay in Nashville.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Two things I learned at the Mill Restaurant: Cornbread waffles are the superior waffle, and fried green tomatoes are the bomb. I love the look of the Mill with its industrial type interior design. The food here can be described as southern influenced comfort food with chicken and waffles, biscuits, and gravy-doused plates. \n\nI ordered the Waffle and Benny which is a cornbread waffle, fried green tomatoes, topped with two eggs Benedict and sausage. The sausage can be replaced with chicken. I ordered the hollandaise sauce on the side - while good, it wasn't the star here. The cornbread waffle was amazing. So tasty, and it took up the entire plate! I was skeptical about getting the friend green tomatoes - thank goodness I did not opt out. They were breaded and salty, basically like a hashbrown and I was pleasantly surprised. Never second guessing fried green tomatoes again! The sausage somewhat tasted like hamburger meat. I wouldn't have said it was sausage, and the patties were quite small. The eggs were cooked to perfection. \n\nThe Mill Restaurant is definitely worth a stop. Given that I don't live in St Pete, this trip has inspired me to find similar cornbread waffles closer to home!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I was a faithful customer of this Meineke starting in 2009. However, in April 2012, they recommended that one of my vehicles get a fuel injector service. Because it was an old vehicle, I had the maintenance work done on the car. Several months later--in October 2012--they recommended that they do this work once again. This time, the work was obviously unneeded and unnecessary. I do not appreciate this lack of attention to detail and that Meineke tried to do the same maintenance work twice in a five month period. In addition, after an oil change, I was five hours from their location in Boise when one of my spark plugs popped out. The reason: the spark plug was only screwed in two threads, and it was forced in crooked. This caused the threading to strip out; thus, I was unable to simply add a new spark plug, had to have a Nevada shop fix the problem, and borrow a car to return to Boise. This problem has caused me considerable shop fees and gas money. After the oil change, Meneike recommended that I change my spark plugs. I supposed that they had checked the spark plugs, causing the loss of threading. However, after visiting with the manager, he told me they never actually checked the spark plugs. Thus, I could have had brand new spark plugs, and they still would have recommended new spark plugs. Thus: 1. Either the shop did cause the mechanical problems OR, 2. Meneike regularly suggests work with no evidence that it needs to be done. Despite the managers, this is not a common practice at \"shops all over.\" Perhaps it is at dishonest ones, but not at ones worthy an \"excellent\" rating. I will no longer be giving my business to Meneike or suggesting that them to others.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Moving from California where there are many restaurants similar to Angry Crab Shack & BBQ. I was happy to see this place open up. \n\nWe all ordered somewhat similar; a pound of shrimp, trifecta but we all got a different spice level. If you like a good spice I would recommend a level 3\/4, if not stick with 2. \n\nThe shrimp was delicious and in a good size, the red potatoes were great! Not under or over cooked. The corn on the cob was a bit sweet, absorbed a lot of the sauce . I would've enjoyed it better if they added a bit more sauce into the bag since i enjoy peeling the shrimps and covering it up in the sauce.\n\nWe also ordered the Cajun fries, char'd and raw oysters. The fries has a nice crunch, size and taste. The amount of seasoning they added to the fries was perfect. The raw oysters was about average but if you get the char'd oysters. My friends and I got a little creative and squeezed a tiny bit of lemon on it with some cocktail sauce and you got one heck of an appetizer! .\n\nTheir sweet tea was okay, I think it'll be much better if it was a bit sweeter. Customer service was fast; it was a bit excessive since multiple servers came by the table to check up but better to have service than none, right?\n\nMy friend from Louisiana said it reminds him of home.

As a starter we ordered the calamari and it was great!highly recommend it as a appetizer but...as far as main courses go they leave much to be desired. They rely mainly on the breading for flavor so if you get something broiled chances are it's going to be very bland. My friend ordered the shrimp and crab combo and I had the grilled combo both had nice portions and the sides were good(steamed broccoli + rice) but like I previously said both were bland even though they had Cajun seasoning on them.so for that I give them three stars.","stars":3.0}

The place does get very crowded at prime time but I can tell you that they turn the tables pretty quickly and I've never waited more than 10 minutes to be seated. The wait staff, the owners and the kitchen staff are extremely nice, the food comes out pretty quickly and I've never had a bad meal there. My favorite part of eating at Lenny's is looking around the restaurant and enjoying all of the funny and eclectic things they have placed around the restaurant. Sitting and watching everyone looking around at all of the comical things written on the walls, hanging from the ceilings and even reading the menu is a lot of fun.

{"text":"The worst experience ever. Parents stay away. \n1. Walked in numerous times at children being yelled at by teachers. \n2. Terrible teacher and staff turnover. In two months most of the people who worked there quit. Including the support staff. \n3. Website is fake and not updated in many years. \n4. Spanish curriculum means teachers yelling Spanish at kids on the playground. \n5. They don't follow any standardized curriculum. Just because the director says there is a curriculum it doesn't mean anything. If your kid ever went to school with a curriculum you would know the difference. \n6. Walked in many times at kids physically pushing each other, hair pulling and teacher was completely unaware of the situation. \n7.  My child comes home withdrawn unlike the other school from last year, there is not much they come home with as far as learning new things or being excited about going to school. \n8. The playground is too big and difficult for teachers to manage. If your kid is small I seriously would worry about their safety and on numerous occasions I was myself concerned for the little ones being together with big aggressive kids. \n9. I watch teachers ignore children's bids for attention because they are too busy counting all the kids on the playground. \n10. Kids are not engaged with in a meaningful way. There is a chaotic feeling and teachers seem very overwhelmed. \n11. Kids watch tv and play on kindle frequently- not for educational purposes but for entertainment. I witnessed that personally. And my kid saw so many movies there as a form of babysitting. \n12. Teachers are very nice but they are expected to do way too much and it's unrealistic. \n13. The art projects are mostly teachers doing all of the work and not process art. Anyone who is actually an artist would know that art is about process not product. \n14. Director's understanding of child development is very limited and it shows throughout the design of the entire program. \n\nPros:\nSome teachers are really sweet. \nSchool is clean and they have a lot of materials and toys and books. \n\n\nI am so very sorry for all the parents who like myself fell into believing that their children are in good hands. I am terribly heart broken that this school is somehow rated number one because most things about it is for appearance only and a product of a good marketing campaign but not a truly educational program with a heart that follows appropriate preschool curriculum and structure.","stars":1.0}

Soba sesame salad - tasty and a nice lighter compliment to the dumplings we had started with, if I wanted to nitpick I would agree that the sauce could be lighter but really I had no complaints.\n\n3.ZFC - spicy soy fried chicken - really delicious, deep soy and sesame flavor, not particular spicy but so good I really didn't care.\n\n4.Age Harumaki - vegatable spring rolls - nothing earth shattering, they were spring rolls but really tasty spring rolls so no complaints.\n\n5.Brussel Sprouts with cashews and spicy miso - the brussel sprouts had just the right amount of color\/char on them and paired well with the cashews, it made a strangely addictive snack food to go with our drinks as we made it through the rest of our meal.\n\n6.Yakionigiri - It was fine? it's a rice ball that's grilled a bit so it's a bit smoky, it was pleasant but not a showstopper on its own, I should have saved some to go with some of our meat dishes.\n\n7.Shio Buta - salt braised pork belly. I happen to love pork dishes. I would cheerfully write poems about this pork belly. So tasty, just the right amount of salt to compliment the fattiness of the pork, the citrus of the ponzu just rounded it out perfectly and it was so very tender. We might have fought a bit over who got the last piece.\n\n8. I can't recall the exact name and it's not on their website menu but the duck breast- my friend has the same feelings about duck that I have about pork and she wasn't disappointed, the skin was crispy which is pretty much what you're hoping for with duck. I stole the last piece in retaliation.\n\nThe bad?? It's a bit pricey which would keep it from being a frequent dining option for full-blown dinner and some may be disappointed with the amount they receive per-plate if they're not accustomed to tapas style dining. That said I can't say that I was disappointed, we had a great experience and I would very much recommend it.

{"text":"131 5&4-star ratings vs just *four* 1-star ratings and *two* 3&2-star ratings should tell you Happy's is an extraordinary place. Every top eatery will have a small-to-tiny percentage of negative reviews from people in a bad mood. Such as the guy with the 2\/15\/2020 review who marked Happy's down for things like the fact that it's really a food truck (Seriously?? Why does that matter?) and having to wait in line (I stood in a long line on Fat Tuesday when Happy's was getting slammed with far more customers than usual and it moved fairly briskly). We eat at Happy's once or twice weekly because the owners and staff are for-real great people, the service is outstanding and warmly personal, and the food is amazing. The hush puppies *are* something very special, contrary to that strange review, literally the best I have ever had -- umami heaven, subtly sweet, creamy & delicious inside and perfect crispy\/crunchy delight outside. The fried oysters are also the best I've had anywhere. The gumbo (I order that at nearly every visit) is perfect. The weekly specials are always imaginative and over the top. The atmosphere with the open courtyard, colorful tables and big shady tree is relaxing, and the always-good-to-great live music on certain days combines with that to make it a classic Dunedin\/Funedin atmosphere. So I encourage anyone to toss out of consideration the 3% negative reviews, consider the 97% (!!) positive reviews, and give Happy's a try. This place is unique and magical.","stars":5.0}

I ordered a Medium Pan Pizza that was cheese and pepperoni with extra cheese and a family order of breadsticks (Two bread stick orders). It came to 29$ and didn't end up questioning that until later. When the order came to the door the guy seemed nice and slightly high. Everything went smoothly and he got a 3$ tip. When I opened my pizza it was thin, burnt and had no extra cheese on it. Not to mention one of sauses was opened and had spilt on the breadsticks. I looked at my receipt, and noticed I was charged 4.29 for each breadstick (Originally listed for 2.99 each) and I was charged for pepperoni (1.15$). I called the location and waited 20 minutes on hold.. When the guy finally answered I was put on hold again because he was supposedly getting the manager. Only 5 mins later the same guy gets back on the phone... He said he could credit me or send out another pizza but told me it would take an hour to arive.

{"text":"For starters, if I could put less than one star, I would.\n\nI am a HUGE animal lover and wanted only to make my dog behave better. Background, he was adopted from the shelter and we had limited information about his background prior to his adoption, as most shelters protect the privacy of those who surrendered them. We decided our dog needed a little help in the manners department and decided to enroll him in the In-Kennel Training program for one week.\n\nOn the website, they list what they focus on with the animals for that time frame. I specified at the dropoff that I wanted my dog to be focused on: walking properly on a leash, aversion of trashcan-diving, barking\/separation anxiety, and car rides. I was told we would be contacted mid stay with an update on his behavior. Wednesday came and I decided to call the facility, was told the message would be relayed to the trainer and I would receive a call back. After no word, I decided to call again the next day and was beyond less than impressed with the information that was relayed to me about how his training was going. They told me they were working on his sits (which he already knew how to do prior to training class). Nothing I asked to be worked on had been at the half-way point in his stay. I tried to remain hopeful.\n\nUpon picking him up and $575 later, they had not worked on anything aside from leash walking. I did think they were a bit forceful with the pinch collar while they were demonstrating what had been worked on and how to reinforce his training at home. Flash forward to us getting him home, he is BEYOND TERRIFIED of us, has an open wound in his back that was not there prior to his being dropped off, he has little to no bark as it sounds his windpipe has been damaged due to the excess use of the pinch collar and force, is now fearful of a leash and collar being put on him and proceeded to pee all over himself when we attempted to take him outside for a walk. The once jovial three year old puppy of mine is now scared if I lift my arm to fix my hair and runs away from us after a verbal correction of misbehavior (stern voice and no physical force). This is certainly NOT a facility that I would recommend sending any animal to because no dog deserves the treatment that I truly believe in my heart was given to my dog. Furthermore, I am taking my dog to the vet this weekend to have his wounds and windpipe looked at as well as the MULTIPLE large knots he has around his neck (most likely from the pinch collar) and to inform her to never recommend this facility to any of her other clients or their pets. I am heartbroken over what I can only imagine my dog went through the long seven days he was at this facility. I should have trusted my gut when I dropped him off and the horrid state of the lobby as well as the smell (smelled like feces and garbage).","stars":1.0}

We are cutting down our office hours for Saturdays (latest excuse, fresh as of June 2019 !!).\n\nOn top of that, the office staff will offer you an \"alternate\" appointment that's atleast 3 months out, and expect you to not complain.

You can't rush soul food.  \n\nMy grandma grew up in the south and God forgive me, but the fried chicken is the best I've ever had.  The potato salad is downright perfect.  The mac & cheese is smooth as silk and reheats the same way.  The peach cobbler is made with fresh peaches and has crust all the way through it.  And the prices are more than reasonable for a platter that has to be rubberbanded shut because there's so much food.\n\nPersonally, I have had such a good time sitting in that dining room talking, many times to the same people.  I've learned more about Philly there than anywhere else.  But if that's not your thing, TIP: call ahead, wait at least an hour, maybe 15 minutes after that.  All I'm asking is that you please, please, not give an amazing soul food restaurant a bad rating for not giving you fast food.\n\nBottom line, this is a great restaurant with a ton of repeat customers, including me, who absolutely love her food and her service.","stars":5.0}

We read about it in the local paper while traveling through and decided to give it a shot. \nThe order process is a bit different in that you order outside and then are served inside the former shop.

The facility is amazing, pulling up you would think it was a world class art museum . We went expecting it to be packed, as it was a nice day and the weekend but it was perfect. Not packed, not deserted. We got in and out son went to the water attraction right away, started playing and didn't stop till we left. We also liked that there was a section just for kids 3 and under that was monitored by an employee for compliance. Each different area had a theme, there was the water theme, jungle, construction, food store, space, cars, shoe store, etc.. We especially liked the hospital section because it was sponsored by CHOP and we are big fans of them. We ended the day by going on the carousel, which my son didn't love but that's more him than it. All in all it was a great time and we will be returning. Be forewarned, this is a museum for young children. Think 7 and under.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"On our visit to SB, my mom & I decided to stop into Blush based on the beautiful patio & Happy Hour Menu. We arrived at 2:50 & the hostess seemed very hesitant to seat us, making sure we understood that Happy Hour didn't start until 3. We were not in a huge rush, so waiting 10 minutes to order was just fine with us. After we were seated, who I assume is the manager came over & also reminded us that Happy Hour didn't start until 3 pm (by this time it was 2:55). I asked if we could give them our order & if they could put it in at 3....he said the food might take a little longer because they are switching over the kitchen, he quoted us 20 minutes. I have worked in food service before & I understand the change over, so we agreed 20 minutes was no problem. We ordered a flatbread pizza & the Tuna TarTar. We did not get our food until 3:50- 50 minutes for 2 appetizers!? Because we were on vacation, we were still in great moods & I kept expecting the waitress to at least apologize for the delay-but that didn't happen. Maybe she was having a bad day..but she was cold and seemed very unhappy. She never asked if she could get anything for us, asked how we were enjoying our food, etc.. The Terra chips that come with the Tuna were super stale, so I asked for new ones- she never acknowledged the fact that they were stale, just set the new ones down without saying a word. The food was ok & what other people around us had ordered off the lunch menu looks amazing! Even though the service was terrible (aside from the nice bus boy who fixed our umbrella & the manager), we considered stopping in on Monday for lunch because the food the previous day looked so good. Unfortunately, even though the menu in the window that lists specials notes the Monday specials.....they were not open & there was nothing posted on the door regarding why.....All in All, I may be back to try the lunch and\/or dinner menu- but really hope they step up their game on the service side!","stars":2.0}

{"text":"This may be harsh, but this is just my opinion... I think Finch and Fork could be overrated. Technically, it is with the aggregate 4 stars on Yelp against my 3. \n\nMy wife and I did their rooftop wine tasting (which I'm not including in this review), then we jumped downstairs for dinner in the restaurant. \n\nThey started us with complementary pickled vegetables, which I loved. Carrots, zucchini, and cauliflower, if I remember correctly. Great start - different, which I enjoyed. \n\nWe kept it easy for the evening and ordered a glass of wine each. Note: the bar (either just that evening or it could be any evening) poured short. I don't think they hit the 6 oz and they certainly were short against the glass. If I had to guess, they poured about 4\/4.5 oz. \n\nTo start, we ordered their fries. Holy hell they were good. They were smoky and intense with rosemary. It was great. It was an ample amount of rosemary, although I'm sure someone would think it was too much. I didn't think so. Strangely, their ketchup wasn't house-made and their lemon garlic aioli (another side condiment to the fries) was \"okay\" in my opinion - nothing that makes your REALLY want a second bite. \n\nMy wife ordered the roasted tomato soup and I ordered the trout. She wasn't too hungry and it was a good-sized serving. Her soup was delicious - I kept stealing more bites from her. Haha. The soup was fantastic, practically pristine. The ricotta sprinkled into the soup was a perfect compliment to the smoky and strong taste of the roasted tomato and kale pur\u00e9e. The kale pur\u00e9e was a surprise and a great addition. It was thick and delicious. It looked just as delicious as it was. \n\nThe trout. Not so great. The spaetzle was dull and bland, but it was nice that it didn't take away from the trout. The fried, flaky kale and saut\u00e9ed spinach that topped the dish were a great addition to compliment the trout. The only problem was the trout - it didn't seem like there was anything special, but I feel like there should've been something special. It's an entree and there are only a few entrees. \n\nI enjoyed the ambience and environment - a rustic, trading post feel with repurposed glasses and strong, sturdy plateware and cutlery. Lighting was excellent. The table was slightly low while the seats sats slightly high, making it perfect for discussion. \n\nI may be a little harsh on the rating, maybe it deserves 4 stars. Now, that I look back at the review, it looks like the short wine pouring and the trout were the only disappointments of the evening. \n\nI guess all in all, I would recommend Finch and Fork, just not the trout.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I came here with my family so that we could spend the day in Santa Barbara and this was the only place in the area that had two beds and didn't cost upwards of $700 for the night. I should have thought this through since it is very close to the start of the school year and there are probably plenty of families looking for rooms this weekend. \n\nPros: The room was mostly clean (aside from a few ants, which no one is SoCal is immune to during the summer), the bed was reasonably comfy, the toiletries were very good. The record player is kinda cool, and the room comes with a mini fridge. The front desk was nice, they even offered a package of s'mores for my daughter. The decor is nice but feels extremely forced in some places. I don't really drink so can't comment on the bar but it looked like a good place to relax.\n\nCons: This is definitely a motel masquerading as a hotel. It feels like a hipster speakeasy and a coconut tree had a baby and made this motel. It is reasonably priced (although close to $400 for the night) because you shouldn't expect hotel luxury, and the exterior of the buildings needs attention. The rooms are chocked full of liquor, drinks, and snacks that you will never use. I brought my mother in law and my 4yo daughter so having this much alcohol in the room is not an amenity. Also why does there need to be that much stuff crammed into the mini fridge? We had to remove everything just to place some leftovers in it. The shower was clean but the water pressure was low. There is no hot tub, which is a real bummer. Lastly, I should not expect to have a package of lube and condoms on display next to the wine and whiskey, especially with a child in the room. Some things are better left to the discretion of the occupants. \n\nIf you want to save some money just go with the Best Western or Courtyard Marriott or just spend the extra $200 and stay at an actual hotel, I definitely will.","stars":2.0}

My experience on Tucson Food Tours changed all this when they ended the tour at the Chocolate Iguana.

To top it all off the owner of the Chocolate Iguana was the sweetest lady ever and she was so passionate about her family business, she took the time to come over and welcome us plus thanking us for visiting her shop and even took the time to tell us the history of the Chocolate Iguana. This really stood out to me and made a very memorable event even more meaningful in my book.

{"text":"My first and maybe last time at Firecracker Pizza & Beer.\n\nTonight was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Saint Louis for a long time. My friends and I went here for dinner and it wasn't too busy. There were a good amount of empty spots for people that called in for a large party and some two-top tables that were open. \n\nUpon walking in, we were not greeted by anyone. I think it was a cook that noticed that we were just like lost and confused so we were finally helped with seating. We ended up sitting near the pizza cooks\/ovens. It took around 10 minutes for us to be greeted and even get menus, which was strange because it was not busy. Since the cooks were right there, we asked him for recommendations because the server kind of left us for a long time after dropping the menus off. Luckily we had some good suggestions on pizza from him. \n\nOur dinner order was a pizza flight consisting of the: No Sleep 'Till Brooklyn, One Bad Apple, and the Spuds Rodriguez. All the pizzas parts had good flavor but my favorite was the Brooklyn portion, the sauerkruat made the slices very distinct from any pizza I've ever tasted- though it did lack a thousand island dressing taste, it was clearly the orange drizzle on the top. The apple portion of the pizza just tasted like half a dessert pizza and the Spud Rodriguez was basically a fully loaded baked potato but in pizza form. \n\nAll three parts were flavorful and worth the price. \n\nThe issue I had with this place was the service, or rather specifically the server we had. I would rate the food alone to be 3-4 and the server we had 1. \n\nOur drinks sat empty for way too long. We would go 20 minutes or more without the server checking on us at a time, there was even a point that my friend took a phone call-- Using the phone call's time stamp we noticed it was at least 23 minutes since we have been checked on. As I am starting this draft for the review it is 8:53pm and the phone call was around 8:30pm. \n\nAfter we finished the pizza my friend ordered the Holy Mole cookie dessert. The cookie actually was finished and sat on the rack for 10-15mins before it was delivered to us. Since we were sitting right there we noticed that it was clearly the cookie ordered. The server then appeared with the checks after being gone for too long of a time. The funny part was when we finally got our checks my friend asked for the cookie and the server admitted to forgetting about it. I ended up putting my card down and looked for where the server went, she was watching tv! It took so long for the server to grab the checkbook - a person in my party went to the restroom and then came back, saw it was still there and brought it to the bar area to get it taken care of. Throughout entire dinner we had not received a single refill. \n\nOverall, I think the pizza has unique options that are worth trying. Maybe order and take out? The service was horrid, possibly the worst I've ever experienced so far- the cooks are nice if you are sitting there. If I had to rate the food separately from the service I would rate the food 3-4 stars and the service 1.","stars":2.0}

The workers are friendly and will give you good recommendations on food if you cannot make up your mind or have a question about the menu.  The best part is how customizable the menu is.  You can substitute ingredients to make your meal raw, vegan, or gluten free depending on what you order.  There is also a build your own menu which is nice for the picky eaters out there.

{"text":"We showed up after 9pm on a Friday night. With 7 in our party, we were expecting a wait but we sat right down. Our waitress was friendly, however we didn't see her often, every 25 minutes or so. The food was mediocre at best. One order was forgotten and came out several minutes later, another of the burgers was cold, and they skimped a little on the amount of french fries they gave us. Based on the below average service and food, I wouldn't recommend it.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best experiences I have had at a restaurant. Impeccable plates with great service, warm environment and best of all highest quality assurance.\n\nWe luckily, miraculously managed to get a reservation for 4 only two or three hours before the reservation was made. I originally planned to go to Fond but when I saw the chance to dine at Bibou, we had to jump on it! The Twitter feed occasionally shows when a vacancy is available (which is rare, since Bibou is frequently cited as one of the hardest places to get a reservation in Philadelphia), so keep checking in case you are in town!\n\nAnyways, we ordered I believe three appetizers and four main dishes. My guests ordered the artichoke soup and the chicken liver mousse and I had the foie gras duo. The soup was divine and while I was not as fond of the mousse, the presentation was very nice. I had a great experience with my foie gras, which was in the standard form as well as in creme brulee. I didn't enjoy the creme brulee as much but thankfully with the complimentary bread, I was able to smear some of it on. One of the unsung heroes of the night had to be the sweetbread accompanied in the foie gras plate. Out of this world good.\n\nMoving on to the main courses...my girlfriend ordered the signature Pied du Porc, stuffed with foie gras and lentils on the bottom. The chef later came out and said that since the beginning, he has made it the same way and has kept it on the menu for the entirety of Bibou's run. I can see why. Wow, the smokiness even reached the lentils. Those lentils alone would bring me back.\n\nI had the hanger steak accompanied by asparagus and fingerling potatoes. The chef's recommendation of medium rare was awesome and I had a great, great steak. One of the best I've come across anywhere. \n\nI can't go into too much details about what my guests ordered although one was in the form of a pie and the other ordered the Dorade. I don't think ordering fish at a place known for its meat is a good idea, but it wasn't bad either!!!\n\nEnding things up, we ordered the creme brulee flavored with tobacco leaves. Very very tasty way to finish the night.\n\nI am in love with Bibou and while I may not eat here in the immediate future (It definitely broke the bank, costing around $220 with tip for four), it is certainly worth a highest recommendation. Philadelphia needs more restaurants like these. Heck, the whole country does. GO TO BIBOU!","stars":5.0}

There is happy hour between 4-6 pm so you can get half off the drink specials. The drinks are very good.\nWe ordered three dishes to share. We got the small plate Mac and cheese which was okay but needed seasoning. It was difficult to notice the different cheeses in the dish. We enjoyed the chicken lettuce wraps and the pepperoni flatbread. Flatbread was a good portion size and it was my favorite among the three dishes.\nService was great as well.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"The hosts had a look like 'how can I help you?' without saying it out loud so I said, 'it's just me'. With that I was immediately seated and given a comfortable few minutes to review things. My server approached and offered drink special information. I went for a local beer, 'I like beer'!  Churchville lager I like a lot. After a few questions about sandwiches I went for my go to pizza. The Americana (?) is just basically pepperoni pizza. It came out in less than 7 minutes but it was perfection. The crust was the right thickness not doughy or or too much sauce. The only thing that was off was it was hot just not piping like fresh out of the oven. But I have no complaints about the food or my server.\n\nThe decor is wood paneling walls and exposed beams, a nice above ground basement vibe. The pizza was good the restaurant clean and organized but slightly expensive for a personal size pizza. If they have Happy Hour deals during the week I would consider returning if not, it's not worth another trip.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Tried going Monday, called ahead and asked how long dinner is served. Was told 10. Showed up at 910 and was told they were closing early because of a meeting, fine i get it but would have been nice to know before driving 30 min to get there.  Was told we could get something quickly. We were already being rushed and barely got in the door. Decided just to Leave. Want too happy considering I didn't get the early closing memo when I called. Decided to try again last night.  Had 2 appetizers I got the garlic bread & my boyfriend got the cheese steak spring rolls. I honestly would love to get the garlic bread again! It was so good!  The spring rolls were good also. Only had a bite because I don't like onions. Both appetisers were presented very nicely!  We both got 12 oz ribeye steak. Was a little disappointing that it only came with a choice of potatoe and no veggies or salad for $28.95. I wanted green beans so I got a side and had to spend another $5.95. It was a decent size portion but a smaller one included with the steak would have been nice. I got fries with mine. They were home made and you could tell they were fresh. Our server was nice & friendly.   It was overall good. But we have a steak house closer that has the same quality steak (if not better) with more options. Probably won't be returning.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I have to give this place just an OK review.  It wasn't a horrible experience, but also not a great experience.  It wasn't great enough for me to want to use them again for any future moves.\n\nI called to book the move, and was told the movers would be there between 8:30 am - 9:30 am.  My \"pre-move letter\" that was emailed to me also had this time.  So, at 9:40 am on the day of the move, I called the office to confirm movers were still coming.  I was then told that they don't arrive in my city until 9:00 am - 10:00 am.  I questioned him on being told the wrong times and having the wrong time on the paperwork, and his response was \"Yeah, they need to change that.\"  10:15 am, and the movers arrived.  They took a look at everything in our 3 bedroom apartment, and the few things we had left in our outdoor storage unit, then began loading the truck.  When they started wrapping our dining room table, they simply lifted the top off and laid it on a blanket, then started to wrap it.  We told them that the top of the table needed a blanket over it as well since the majority of it was exposed, and they told us they would just wrap it with plastic wrap and it would be fine.  A couple of hours in, they randomly left to drive down to the storage unit to load that stuff.  This wouldn't have been a problem if they hadn't left our furniture and boxes all over the front of the unit lawn and in the hallway.  I came down the stairs just in time to catch a box from falling off a chair that was blocking the hallway as someone tried to walk past it.  I ended up sitting in the summer noontime sun (while pregnant) for about an hour to make sure our stuff wasn't stolen, pushed over, or peed on by a dog.  In the assortment of furniture was the top of the dining room table, with the exposed top leaning against a stone pillar. When they got back, the truck was full.  One of the guys said, \"Yeah, I didn't realized you had so much stuff, otherwise I would have packed the truck higher.\"  So then, they ended up putting stuff in our personal vehicles for us to drive over to the new house.  One of the guys went to throw a dining room chair in the back of my personal truck, and I had to yell at him to stop because the chair needed to be covered to prevent the Rhino-liner from scratching it up.  Once we arrived, and everything was unloaded, we did a quick inspection to make sure everything looked ok.  Not surprisingly, we discovered the top of the dining room table had deep scratches in it.  When we pointed it out, they asked if we wanted to fill out a damage report, to which we obviously said yes.  \n\nThe damage report for the table said we would be contacted in two days.  After a week goes by and we haven't heard anything, I call the office about it.  I was then told that it takes about 5-7 days to hear back, but that the person in charge was on vacation, so I wouldn't hear anything until the following week.  I again brought up the fact that the paperwork said \"two days,\" and was told, yet again, \"Yeah, they need to change that.\"  When I finally got a call about the damage, it was a voicemail letting me know that they were sending someone out Friday morning, and that company would be contacting me.  He also apologized and told me the movers never gave him the damage report (so had I not called, I would have never been contacted).  On Friday morning, after the furniture company came out, I get a call from Two Men telling me they were going to be sending someone out for the table, and I asked, \"Do you not remember calling me earlier this week about this?\"  His response, \"Are you sure it was me?\"  Me: \"Yes, I still have the voicemail.  You're the only one who handles this stuff, correct?\"  Him: \"Yeah, it would be me, I just didn't have any notes about it.\"  In the end, they ended up \"totaling\" the table and will be sending a check for an insignificant portion of what the table actually cost.  I guess the blame falls on us for that, for not micromanaging and demanding the movers do their job correctly and cover the table.  \n\nOverall, I'm left with the impression that no one at this location knows what they're doing.  I don't know that this is true of the entire company, but this particular unit just doesn't seem to have it together.  The move went OK, but I'll be giving a different company my business for any future moves.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I've been to this location on numerous occasions, but I felt like my final visit there warranted a review. \n\nI first stopped by last week, and to my dismay, the late night hours have changed. The restaurant now closes at 1AM instead of 2AM, so my friend and I had to find another place for our late night meal. \n\nI was finally able to visit again tonight, which I now regret. We ordered our food and two out of five dishes came out promptly. We sat there waiting another 25+ minutes before the rest of our food came out. The server informed us that they were short staffed and only one kitchen worker was making the food. Thank goodness there was only one other table, or else we would have been waiting a lot longer.\n\nI also witnessed another server handing a dish I ordered to someone from a table she was serving. I know it was my dish because I overheard her explaining that this wasn't what they ordered, but that they should try it anyway, and if they didn't like it she would bring them something new. I'm not sure why she didn't just go back in the kitchen and recheck the ticket for the correct table. This usually wouldn't upset me; people make mistakes, and I get that. But when you've been waiting for almost half an hour for the second half of your meal, it got a bit frustrating. \n\nThe food has definitely changed for the worse. The sushi rice was mushy. The ramen broth was bland. The tuna tartar was flavorless. The takoyaki was missing most of the octopus. The only reason I gave a second star was because the servers were really nice. The other server came to our table and apologized for her mistake, and our server offered to take our drinks off the bill.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"My wife and I decided to stop by here for our date on friday night without a reservation.  We had called earlier in the day but they were booked up until 9.  We were strongly encouraged to come out though and something might be open.  \n   When we arrived, just after sitting down at the bar to wait for something to open, there was a table that opened up outside on the patio.  It was perfect weather so we didn't mind.  Great music played the whole time we were there as well\n    We were greeted by our waiter who was very pleasant with helping us with a bottled wine selection.  We decided on a bottle of Cannonau di Sardegna after consulting with the waiter, who seemed to be pretty knowledge about wine especially the wines that they were serving. We got a tuna carpaccio app that was not on the menu but sounded great when described by the waiter.  For our main courses, my wife got full order of the Potato stuffed ravioli and I got the Brasato al Barolo, a beef dish.   \n    The tuna carpaccio was so  tasty and truly just an all around refreshing appetizer.  The Potato stuffed ravioli was very good.  Potato pasta can be a little bland or plain by itself but along with the butter\/lemon and crawfish tails, their flavor was just all the more enhanced.  My dish, the Brasato al Barolo was superb.  The meat was very tender and had a very savory taste.  The mashed potatoes that came with the dish were as up to par with beef and completed this dish very well.\n   For dessert, after a hard decision, we settled on getting the tiramisu, which we were kind of nervous about.  The tiramisu was fabulous and it reinspired my wife and I to not lose hope in getting great desserts out.  \n    Overall the meal was one of the best that we've had in Nashville and it was just an overall great dining experience.  We also very much enjoyed the bottle of wine that we finished off throughout the meal. We are so proud to have this restaurant on the East Side.","stars":5.0}

I'm definitely going to be a Savanh die hard now.\n\nHaving moved here recently from California, I was spoiled with fantastic authentic and creative Laotian and Thai restaurants in Thai Town LA and San Francisco.  There is a large diaspora in CA that cooks delicious Thai and Laotian food. My expectations for authentic Thai and Laotian cuisine in the St. Pete area, or Florida for that matter, had become unachievable and hopeless.  This is not one of those \"Thai-Sushi\" places (I get it, we all have to make money, but it deeply disturbs me, and would be similar to seeing a restaurant sign that stated \"Tapas & Wurst\").  \n\nThen I found Savanh and it positively changed my Florida culinary experience for Thai and Laotian food!  \n\nThe Panang Curry was savory, complex and spicy - and not overly sweet.  The Laotian papaya salad was truly Laotian and not Thai.  It had the correct amount of fish sauce that was not overbearing.  Their Khoua Kee Mow noodles were spot on and even had a slight jungle style edge.  The staff even delicately wrapped me a mixture of spices for my take out bag. Yum!  \n\nSpeaking of the staff, they were warm and inviting!  They were very nice to me and I definitely left the restaurant with a smile on my face - even before I had tried my take out food.

{"text":"Really a 3.5 star experience, but bumping it up to 4.  The GF and I walked on over here for dinner a few weeks ago to check out the Thai.\n\nThis is a converted house, and the front rooms been converting into a dining space.  Maybe a half dozen tables.  Their two-tops are a bit strange - I think they're meant to be accent end tables, so they're really long - works pretty well though as there's plenty of space to have the food between the people eating, and still have plenty of space to have your dining plate in front of you.  Might be a bit awkward if you weren't eating family style. The legs on the tables are a bit awkward - they're big (maybe turned from a 4x4), so if you're not careful you could bang your knee against one of them.\n\nIt was pretty quiet when we went - there was an older couple at the table next to ours, and a group of 3 or 4 in the far corner.  Service was friendly and intimate - reminded me a little of the experience at Daughter's.  The server was apparently the husband co-owner, and his wife was cooking, and he definitely was not a server.  He mentioned how his son was usually working the front of the house.  Very friendly, but not as attentive as a regular server would be - a good example would be my GF ordered the pad thai, and I had to point out that she got to pick her protein, and he was a bit surprised by that.  We also had the Tom Yum and a curry (I think it was the yellow curry).  \n\nWe were asked if we liked spicy, and we said yes.  The Tom Yum was very spicy, with a great lemongrass flavor and nice, large prawns.  The pad thai had great flavor, and the GF said it was probably tied for her 2nd favorite pad thai (behind Bangkok Cuisines).  This was saying a lot as the noodles were over cooked, so a little soft\/sticky - common issue when making rice noodles, but not one you'd expect to experience in a restaurant.  The curry was good, but not great.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it was a good, solid curry.\n\nOverall, I think we'll go back as we can walk here, and as long as we have a bit of time to spare, it's a nice, intimate dining experience.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I really like this place, it's probably my favorite Mexican restaurant in Philadelphia. I do wish they had a larger variety of taco types though, as I don't really like fried chicken or fried fish that much(2 out of their 3 taco types). I love the variety of chips they have that comes with their guac though but the last time I went, they seem to give less of those and more of the plain tortilla chips. I really like the margaritas they offer though, except a lot of them taste the same. Could not taste any plum or basil in the plum basil margarita and it was just like a plain margarita. This place is definitely a date spot considering how small, dimly lit and cozy seating is. Altogether I still love this restaurant especially when outdoor seating is available.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Never been to Tucson in my 11 years of living in Arizona and was down in Tucson for the day visiting a friend from out state, I was with a group of friends and we all deicide to head on over to Old Tucson Studios, ok I'm not a John Wayne fan nor fan of western movies, just wanted to tell you that up front. \n\nOn the drive to Old Tucson Studios you have to drive through part of Saguaro National Park, if you haven't seen a huge group of Saguaros and it appeals to you, then you will be ticketed pink, they are just everywhere, and when you stop at the little turn out and just look down the hill, it is impressive, but I'm a city chick, the whole desert scape thing hasn't impressed me yet, but it was cool seeing all the cacti. \n\n\nOk here is a great tip for all you Arizona residents; Old Tucson Studios is 9 bucks for those who live in the state! So go with a friend and its buy one get one free! For everyone else its 18 bucks.  But let me tell you, it's worth the money.  I thought with it being a \"western\" thing I wouldn't like it, but I had a very good time!\n\nI enjoyed myself, when we 1st got in we just went into tourist mode and looked at everything and took tons of pics and just goofed off, like in the 1st building to the right after you walk it, it has a little Morse code station you can send messages to someone on other side of the building and right above it is had Text Messaging 1800 style, ok that was funny. \n\nWe then wondered up the road and there was a Statements show going on, and the governor was making a speech and really I was just half listening but what I remember was Work Hard Play Hard, I said WOOHOO!!! you got it! it was cool.  \n\nCaught most of the shows, some were funny, like the one about curse of Santa Maria, ok that one had me laughing, and the bad guy, he was a hottie!! Saw the can can girls and the quick and the dead, road the train, was sad when we weren't robbed LOL\n\nOver all had a great time down at Old Tucson Studios!  \n\nOnly one hiccup and it was that the Yelp app would not let me check in :(","stars":5.0}

{"text":"In my opinion there are way too many people looking for the \"spa-gym\" experience these days - tanning beds, wheat grass shots, and eucalyptus scented towels to wipe their single bead of sweat on.\n\nThankfully,  LA Fitness is not one of these places.  It's clean, has up-to-date equipment, and has pretty decent locker rooms.  It is a huge space, but I do have some gripes about how they use it.  I think about 60% of their serious lifters use the free weights, but the machines take up 5 times the amount of space in the facility.  As a result, the free weight section gets packed very quickly (especially during peak hours). \n\nI never really use the cardio equipment, but the upstairs treadmill area is always pretty crowded.  People complain about the machine maintenance, but if you think about those things take a POUNDING 8 hours a day 7 days a week so they are going to get a little beat up.  I've never seen any issues with the resistance equipment going unfixed after a day or two.\n\nThe basketball court is a plus, I usually shoot around a bit to warm-up and never really have trouble getting a ball or waiting.  The only downside is that the wall is extremely close to the sidelines so it feels a little cramped around the edges.  They could use a few new basketballs as well.  \n\nI never had a problem with the sales process, I actually thought they were professional without being too aggressive.  I checked out three competing gyms and ended up selecting LA fitness due to their size and availability of classes for my wife.  After I signed up, I never heard another word about buying training services or anything similar.  \n\nOverall, this gym is not perfect but gets the job done and meets my needs.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"A great new spot to add some new flavor to the downtown Boise scene. \nNew space in a new building on the east side of downtown Boise. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating with nicely appointed decor. \nThis was my first time at this franchise. I was pleased with the quality and amount of food. It was well prepared for a take out order. \n\nBut the customer service is where this place needs to step it up. \nA couple items for improvement...it was mid-afternoon when I visited. There were several tables that were dirty and hadn't been cleaned. Since no one else was there I wondered why someone didn't take the time to clean\/straighten a little. Especially important when we have heightened cleanliness expectations. \nAlso there was 1 main worker plus 2 management looking staff behind the counter. I don't know about you, but management should ALWAYS greet customers as a model of behavior...not just leave that to the service employees. The person who took my order also prepared my food. Another customer walked in and had to wait about 5 minutes while my order was being prepared. Again staff didn't acknowledge him or anything. I think those are the little things that go a long way. Or again, management pitches in when the other employees have their hands full.\n\nI'd eat here again, hoping that they can have service that meets the quality of their food.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"We've been to this location a couple of times in the past. We haven't been back because the traffic in this area is horrendous. I was reminded of that last Friday when we decided to have dinner there. \n\nAnyway, the service started out very good. We received our salad and bread sticks. This is truly the only reason worth coming here in my opinion. I absolutely love their salad dressing! So we decided to get their make your own pasta bowl. We selected the angel hair pasta with the five cheese marinara sauce and shrimp as the meat topping. I should have asked for more parmesan cheese on my pasta bowl. It was basically tasteless. I remember the sauce being more flavorful than that, but maybe it was the ratio of sauce and angel hair pasta that made it this way. I feel like there should have been more sauce, and definitely a ton of cheese to give it more of a flavor. The sauce had no acidity whatsoever. The shrimp were those little (previously frozen) bay shrimp that looked like they had been boiled. There was no grilling or searing of any nature. It was just your average pasta dish that you would make at home for yourself (with little to no effort). \n\nThings got worse when a party of 12 were seated near us. Our server became non-existent about that time. It's a lot to handle all at once, and I get that. We didn't get our caf\u00e9 lattes until asking for it again. It finally came out, but it was delivered by a different server who was helping out. That would have all been fine, but they forgot the spoons. She said she would be back, but she never returned. So, we used our table knives to stir the coffee after adding sugar. I should have remembered that this is a very busy location.\n\nWith that said, I think the only time I've ever had a good experience at Olive Garden is when getting the soup and salad combo meal. I think I'll stick to that when I'm in the mood for it next time. This is the place to go to for your average Americanized Italian classics. Seriously folks, there are better Italian restaurants in the area. I'd rather pay the extra price for good Italian food.

The service was subpar and the waitress was absent and seemed as though she would rather be somewhere else.  (We gave her a pass on that, because everyone has an off day once in awhile.) Though the service was just the beginning.  \n    We started with a chicken skewer appetizer, which was the best part of the meal, but that's not saying much as it was not fantastic and wholly unmemorable. For dinner two of us got ramen and one had the fried rice.   To start, the broth in the ramen tasted like fishy dishwater and the rice tasted had an aroma akin to rotting garbage.   We were throughly displeased.  I thought about mentioning it to our waitress, but we had decided that our appetite was gone anyways so we just asked for the check.  I always finish my food, as I don't care for being wasteful, but no one at the table was able to stomach these dishes.  We paid and left.\n\nMaybe they were having an off night, or something, but I won't be coming back.

If the food was excellent, I might have overlooked this rudeness. But the lunch special was far from excellent, consisting of rubbery chicken drowning in an excess of sauce. I couldn't finish the chicken, because it was impossible to chew. The salad was OK (too much dressing, though). The spring roll was dry.

Which leads me to the two reasons I withhold that fifth star:\n\n#1: This may be a regionalism, but I don't think so. Steak and an iceberg wedge go together like a horse and carriage so to speak and to ME, an iceberg wedge means BACON - LOTS of it - and BLUE CHEESE. The bacon on my salad was SUPERB... and... almost an afterthought. A garnish. NO-NO. And the dressing - I can't understand this - it was almost all buttermilk, with just a trace of Roquefort. I was really dismayed by this, as was the person I shared the salad with.  \n\n#2: YES, it seems the shrimp cocktail is their signature dish. Personally, I don't get it, and don't think they need the gimmick (maybe they do; I honestly don't know). I'll say this much - it's all about the horseradish heat and having grown up in eastern european households, heat doesn't impress me. When I have a shrimp cocktail, I'm in it for the tenderness of the shrimp - given the terrible news unfolding about the shrimping\/slave trade, it's going to take a lot to get me to order this dish anyway, so I'd like to really taste what I've ordered. As for the sauce - yeah, it's hot, and the two people at my table who ordered it enjoyed it a great deal. \nBut I personally just don't like having \"signature\" ANYTHING foisted upon me (NOT that they did, but they REALLY extolled its virtues) - it just seems the meat needed no support. I went for the steak. I had the steak. I was blown away by the steak (BTW, another friend had the rib eye which was rare and marbled to perfection - honestly, GREAT beef...).\n\nI was with six people and we closed the place, though we NEVER felt rushed. EVERYone enjoyed themselves and their meals, and if I lived in Indy I think I'd weigh about four hundred pounds. Caveats aside, I say it's worth the price.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Once our claim was upgraded to \"Serious\" we were transferred to a lousy attorney (Eslmerada\") then we finally landed a well rounded experienced attorney.  My complaint is that my wife and I have emails asking questions about our case that has received a response in a week. I thought that maybe 48-72 hours would be an appropriate time frame to respond back to any questions or concerns that we may have. Well I guess that don't think that. \n\nI have spoken with some lady Nina that is supposedly the boss of the assistants of the attorneys about the issues that we have,  and she is very rude. So while we wait on someone to respond back, my wife is suffering with major pains. Appears that we have to do all the foot work, yet they want 38%. \n\nI had to pay over $700.00 out of my own money just to have my surgery that was needed to get me out of the pain that I was in. Guess what their response was, we'll we are not going to front the money for the surgery.  Why not, you are getting 38% of the total judgment AND, We are the ones that are having to pay the medicals. \n\nAnyway,  I think we have an experienced attorney,  but we are having to deal with lack of response while waiting in pain and having to deal with unsympathetic and rude personal. \n\nI wished I knew back then what I know now and my choice of law firm would have been different.","stars":1.0}

I even prefer Blue Oak to the Joint which has disappointed me and skimped in their portions in my last few outings. Blue Oak excels in both quantity and quality. Their ribs won third place i believe at Hogs for the cause against stout competition. The wings are smoked first before fried making them the best in the state. Their sauces are also award winning. The hot, the jerk, bbq, and buffalo are all outstanding. The brisket sandwich i ate yesterday was delicious. The brisket bark and smoke ring were both tasty and ideal. The pulled pork is also great. The sides are outstanding - mac and cheese, brussel sprouts and baked beans. I think peoples only qualms about blue oak is that the employees there tend to be curt and grouchy sometimes. However, these men are cooks, not waiters. The owners of chickie wah wah complain that customers arent paying cover for the music but no one would care about chickie wah wah if it werent for blue oak.   I hope they retain the same quality when they open into a bigger restaurant and I hope they stay in Mid City. Best bbq restaurant in Louisiana!","stars":5.0}

I've had a similar appetizer at Stella and this one blows it out of the water.\n\nThe pizzas are sizeable, so our server recommended that if we split a pizza, he'd suggest one additional plate per person.  Since we were saving room for dessert, we went with the Uovo pizza for dinner.  The meat lover in me was hoping for some more gianciale, but aside from that, the pizza was perfect.

Rich sauce, turtle tastes like any other meatball.\n- shellfish stew (gulf shrimp, littleneck clams, blue crab, collard greens & pot likker): very delicious, large shrimp and a good number of clams; smooth yet flavorful, good to share!\n\nSides:\n- roasted broccoli (chili flakes & bagna cauda): the broccoli was too sour, likely from the anchovy in bagna cauda\n- spring vegetable tabouleh (cucumbers, tomatoes, feta & mint): too much bulgur wheat, not enough parsley or tomatoes; we were a bit disappointed with this one\n\nDesserts:\n- coconut stuffed snowball (Louisiana berries, vanilla & white chocolate): deeeelicious! would definitely recommend!\n- black cocoa cake (blueberries, brown butter & cardamom): I was tempted by the fruit + chocolate combo, but it was a little too rich in texture and flavor in hindsight\n\nWines:\n- Chateau Bonalgue Pomerol 2012: smooth, fruity with clean finish; red berry tastes\n- Chateau Le Puy \"Emilien\" Cotes De Bordeaux 2016: on the sour\/acidic side, heavy on the tannins\n\nOverall, great environment for families\/groups. If you're looking for some French-inspired dishes, here it is!","stars":4.0}

The chicken itself and the cuke and chili salad was good, but the peanut sauce was gross.  Absolutely not good.   The drizzle of coconut milk on top was welcomed considering how bad the sauce was. I don't understand why toast came with it, but whatever. \nThe noodle dishes, however, were great.  Both the pud thai and pud kee mao (drunken noodles) were generous portions, spicy, and full of fried tofu.  I like Siam Square better, but didn't remember how to get there.","stars":3.0}

The Piazza is a ton of fun, and your friends will LOVE to come here and hang out.  But YOU will have to be here 24\/7.\n\n1.  Only VERY social people who don't mind music thumping through their walls, screaming drunk girls downstairs, mass crowds of the local city folk attending weekend events in their front yard, and light peeking through the blinds should live here.  \n\n2. Northern Libs, and especially the Piazza, are very pricing per square foot.  $1800 a month won't get you much space here.  Definably go for a place with an outside deck. \n\n3. We have experienced two murders while living here.  One in the building, and one as the girl was leaving the Piazza about three blocks away.  \"Todo, we aren't in Kansas anymore. \"  Don't let the crowd fool you...No Libs is still central Phila.  \n\nAll in all the 18 months were fun, but I moved out and on to quieter pastures.  \n\nGood luck!","stars":3.0}

I'm new to beer and primarily only like sours, but I got 3 non-sours and they were pretty dang good. \n\nWhat caused me to knock off one star was the service. One of the men behind the counter was nice, but the other was not. The service was pretty slow for the average amount of people there. The one man I did not enjoy service from was caused by the fact I had to place beer and food orders. I placed my drink order and he asked to see my ID and if I wanted to open a tab (meanwhile I already did all this). Then before I could finish my order he walks away and helps someone else. Thankfully the other man behind the counter helped me finish my order. \n\nAs for the food the French fries and giant pretzel are very good! I would say the outside portion of the brewery is lacking. I think it has so much potential but definitely needs a face lift.","stars":4.0}

The front desk people go out of their way to learn your name, and the practitioners are very good. The two dentists I've seen have been very efficient and effective in their treatment, and the hygienist Joy is excellent, as she is very informative about your treatment options and treatment plan. Doctor Khouri did a recession procedure on me that didn't work the first time, and was very accommodating in revising the procedure several months later. My only concern is that they are trying to be a patient mill. My insurance is very good and at times I've felt like that they have been trying to take advantage of that, not realizing that my insurance doesn't cover everything and that in trying to increase insurance billing I've been nailed with some pretty steep bills. I don't really get the sense they are very sensitive to patient cost. However, I recommend them.","stars":3.0}

There were numerous TVs to sit by. It was cold and rainy - but there was a roof (and some heaters hehe). Moral of the story - it was perfect. Some friends met us out and we all had a great time. We were in perfectly spaced from others. Pitchers are a steal. Disco fries are to die for! And the hot wings are not bad (could be spicier). Also, the waitstaff was lovely! Helpful but not too clingy. \n\nThe wine garden is connected to this establishment but you can order food from this menu in the beer garden too.

You can also go with a volunteer who will give you FREE access to the fourth floor and the nicest view of the harbor and SB in the area.\n\nI loved the Sailor Sam Tattoo-a-tron. It uses a projector to \"tattoo\" a traditional sailor tattoo onto you. I loved the narrators voice and learned a lot about naval tattoos and their meaning.\n\nThe old diving helmets and suits were also very interesting, the lengths people went to experience ocean depths being the fountainhead for our current deepsea technology and understanding of what's deep beneath those waves.\n\nThere's a fun submarine mockup with real periscope that lets you look out on the pier our kids spent a lot of time on.","stars":5.0}

So then I stop them & ask for the person I made the appointment with. They know I am going to do this, why put me in this position? \nToday I made an appointment with either Mike or Matt. Did Mike or Matt do my nails? No. Not at all. Another woman did. She gave me a pedicure, no complaints there. I got a gel manicure. She also did that. 5 of my nails were uneven, I asked for it to be fixed. & it's not like one & done. No I have to continue to ask. Now we are painting. I put my nails under the light once & there are so many bubbles. She tried to file them away, I go ahead & asked \"why are there bubbles?\" Bc we are not about to pretend like that didn't happen. She ignores me. I say \"I don't want to continue if there are bubbles\" she ignores me. She continues. Files the bubbles away on the other hand. When she files it, they leave little black dots from the file. So now I have bubbles & little black dots. All around it's great. 3 of my nails are still noticeable uneven. I keep telling myself I'll tell Matt that I want him to redo them but then I am so irritated bc I have already been there for an hour & a half. She lotions my hands. & the puts this towel that smells like mold. Now my hands smell gross. I was over it. \nThis is my first time never tipping at a nail place.

The Hot Stuff restaurant is located conveniently on Bell Road in Antioch is typical of most locations you will find. \n\nThey are located in a shopping center so there is ample parking and all parking is free, this is not typical of many other hot chicken stores closer to town. The store is clean and the staff are overall friendly. You order your selection at the counter and there are plenty of tables for dine in options.

I had come prepared with some sample photos and let her work her magic from there. I came in with hair down past the middle of my back and left with a sassy, little bob. My hair was donated to Pantene and Wigs for Kids (do your research or ask for suggestions if you are looking to donate your own hair). \n\nI'm not very good about styling my hair, but Angela made recommendations and suggestions throughout my entire appointment based on what would work best for me.

Will definitely be getting pizza from here again.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"We went here about a year ago and it was so nice.  Went again last evening and totally disappointed!!  The buffet was ravished and I had to ask three times if they were going to replenish the raw oysters - finally after the third time they put SEVEN oysters on the ice.  The crab legs were a joke - three skinny little legs on the ice the entire hour or so we were there eating.  The sushi bar was minimal and they did not put out any fresh the entire time we were there.  We arrived just after 8 and from their ad they are open until 9:30.  The only item that was replenished while we were there was the oysters.  Never again!!    Save your money!!","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I've been wanting to get here since following its opening on Instagram. Unfortunately, I and my party of 3 were all disappointed. I'll start with the positive. The service was great. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Second, the atmosphere is so cute and fun. It has a young, hip, and modern feel while still being very kid-friendly...they even give parties with kids a basket with little toys to keep them occupied. While these things were great, the food simply put was not good. The burgers have an extremely strong liquid smoke (or lighter fluid) taste that gives the burger a fake taste and overpowers all the other enjoyable burger flavors. In addition to the bad taste, it's almost like the liquid smoke is pouring out of the burger which makes the bun wet and soggy and your hands extremely messy. I could see the liquid pouring out of the burger in my tray. The fries are average. They're nothing special, but not bad. We also ordered the whole chicken. When it came out we were quite excited due to its crunchy appearance. While the chicken was extremely crunchy, it had zero flavors. My husband had the chicken sandwich, which wasn't on the menu, but we knew to ask about it since we'd seen it on Instagram. He said it was good. Our chocolate milkshakes were good. Other than the atmosphere and customer service, I'd have no reason to return here, which is unfortunate, because I was hoping to love it. Food is also WAY overpriced!","stars":2.0}
{"text":"The HUB is definitely a great find in Tucson. Downtown on Congress this little place has a big flavor. I had the Lobster roll and it was just amazing. It was warm and the bun was too, although it was dressed proper it wasn't soggy and the fries were terrific.\n\nI also enjoy their inventive cocktails. The \"Old Pueblo\" will knock your socks off, it's very strong so be warned. Also,  make sure you also check out the ice cream, it's kind of what they're known for, you can get anything from traditional chocolate to Mexican Wedding cookie flavored ice creams.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I've been eating fatayers, an Arab meat pie, from Sunbake Pita Bakery since I was a teenager. I most definitely took it for granted, not knowing where exactly it came from since my mom always picked up a bag whenever our freezer ran out. As a recent graduate, working without a solid break in the pharmacy gets tough, and heating these little pies up and eating it within two to three bites is always a win for me, and it quickly became one of my favorite quick meals. Last week my mom wasn't feeling well, so I was absolutely delighted to go pick some up in her stead.\n\nLocated on 134 Ave and 107 St, it was only a five-minute drive from my house. Ridiculously close to most north Edmontonians. You know how cops are outside of Tim Hortons, grabbing a coffee or donut to go? Well, taxi drivers are here grabbing donairs and pies to go!\n\nThe inside has a simple order counter, with larger pita packages on the side, and smaller to-go orders in the front. There's even a side counter of various nuts, available in bulk. I've never been to the Middle East, but I would imagine markets would be lined with these beautifully roasted nuts!\n\nAfter ordering a bag of mixed fatayers (sold by the dozen) and a bag of sfeha meat fatayers (our usual), each bag for $10, I asked the owner if they were related to the Pita Bake on 153 Ave and 127 St, to which he replied, \"No, completely different. Completely different. We are incomparable.\" Oh, well then. But they have similar fatayers? Which I had never tried. I was actually going to do a comparison post but the next few minutes with the owner changed my mind. And here's why:\n\nHe quickly took me to the side of the shop to show me their operation! I didn't ask to be shown, nor did he know I was a blogger, which to me shows that this was his pride and joy. Not comparable, indeed! The other place does not make their pitas like Sunbake Pita does!\n\nThey run 22 hours a week in the back, making fresh pitas to be distributed all over Edmonton and even as far away as B.C and Manitoba. Think of all the donair places you eat at. Any Middle Eastern wrap. Shwarma! Most likely the pita came from Sunbake Pita! Stacks of flour lined the right side and ready to be mixed in the mixer at the end of the room (shown in photos. Dough gets put into the a motion-sensor divider, which he turned on to show me. The sliced dough gets rolled and pulled up through two stages of proofing for a total of 20 minutes. Eventually the dough passes through a long oven, almost half the length of the room. 10 seconds through this bad boy and the pitas are ready! Check out the flame in my photo! Up and around the room, the pitas cool, and end up in the packaging station where they are packed six to a bag. The whole operation is able to run 6000 pita pieces per hour at maximum capacity, assuming that a steady stream of dough is being placed into the divider. Bonkers! I didn't realize they had this whole scale operation going on the side. Mom was fairly impressed when I came home with more than just a couple bag of fatayers!\n\nBy the time I got home, I was too excited to save my pastries for that work day's meal. Had to have it for lunch! The mixed bag had four of each: herb, spinach fatayer, and cheese pie; plus I had my dozen sfeha meat fatayer to boot.\n\nThe herb fatayer is on a thicker piece of pita, and uses a lot of oregano. Definitely a different flavor profile from the others, yet simple. Not as savory either. The spinach fatayer has a nice heaping filling of steamed spinach, with a slightly sour seasoning to it. My new favorite: the cheese pie. Little puff pitas with a three cheese filling of mozzarella, cheddar, and feta. Yum! And of course, my family favorite: the sfeha meat fatayer, ground beef mixed in with spices, onions, and crushed fresh tomatoes. It might not look much, but trust me, delicious! Even my coworkers have started eating them and they showed absolutely no interest in my lunch before! Probably have to start bringing in extra for them... keep your hands off the fatayers!\n\nDefinitely get your money's worth here, and I still have yet to try their flat meat pies (think pizza style) and wraps! Absolutely love the fact that the fatayers can easily be frozen and reheated within seconds. Their pita breads are sold almost everywhere, including Real Canadian Wholesale Club, Planet Organic, H&W Produce, and all locations of the Italian Centre Shops. They have been my margherita pizza base for many years now - laziest, yet best way to make a pizza if you don't want to make your own dough but want a thin crust. Thanks so much to the owner for showing me around, absolutely the highlight of my week. He's such a kind gentleman and proud of his business of over ten years. Check them out when you get a chance!","stars":5.0}

Our server was an older woman who seemed nice at the beginning but wasn't nice at all. We ordered drinks; those came out right away. Our server asked if we were ready to order appetizers and dinner ; my brother said yes but I was still on the fence. He wanted mussels and because they are all you can eat I stated we'd share. She said we couldn't share so I said okay no worries I'll order something else and try one or two of his mussels to see if I wanted to order that since tas an entree since I didn't have a big appetite. She became pissed she instantly began telling me there no big difference and all this other nonsense so I told her go ahead and put in my appetizer and his mussels as an appetizer in the mean time while I figure out what I want for an entree. \n\n25 freaking minutes later after badgering the bartender politely of course to check on our appetizers because our server was so involved in her big party table that we clearly didn't matter & from then on the shitty service continues. \n\nThe worst part is my Bf asked me not to say anything to the manager & to do it another time.  So I did the next day & was promised they would fix it & offered me a gift card to come back. \n\n1 Month later; I'm guessing spending $200 at a Resturant I thought prides itself on customer service didn't care to follow up with correcting our experience.

As soon as I walked through the door, a server approached and asked if I ordered takeout. My order was ready and packaged up on a table, and it took no time to pay and head out! \n\nThere's a real legit espresso set-up, so if I lived in the area I would definitely recommend popping in just for a coffee! I tried a fancier drink my first time, an Iced Coconut Latte, that was recommended by a very friendly employee over the phone. Another good one is the Iced Mexican Mocha made with real mexican chocolate. Both great. \n\nFood is so good as well! Highly recommend the Molletes - trust me. It sounds plain on paper (pieces of baguettes topped with refried beans and optionally your choice of meat, and a side of pico), but it's so yummy, and I've not seen it on many menus!

{"text":"Honestly, I was a little disappointed. Bloodshed Farms consists of 4 different standard attractions with different themes, a haunted prison, a clown walk through, a corn walk through & a hay ride. They also have addition attraction called the Bloodshed that I didn't participate in. \n\nI arrived around 8:15 on a Saturday night & got in line to buy tickets (tip - buy them online beforehand, or on your phone while waiting in line like several people did). Eventually get to the front & pay $25 for all 4 normal attractions (normally $30, but I had a coupon). All said & done with going through the attractions & waiting on the lines for each one I spent about 3 1\/2 hours there, most of it in line.\n\nThe attractions from best to worst are: The prison, the clown area, the corn walk through & a hay ride. \n\nThe haunted prison was by far the best (I believe the owners ran a prison themed haunt previously so that makes sense), which has a few different areas you'd expect to find, like a laundry facility, showers, execution chamber, cells, etc.\n\nThe clown area was still good, but I felt the theme\/sets dropped off. Yes, there are lots of clowns, but not much to give it the feel of an actual circus. A carnival barker, some side show signs in a hallway, I think only 1 room had circus music. Nothing to make it scream \"CLOWNS\" other than just people in clown attire in a normal haunted house. Some of the actors were very good though.\n\nThe corn walk through (it's not a maze, just a path with jack o lanterns every few feet), was very sparse. Walk 50 feet, go into a haunted shed, walk 50 feet, another scene, etc. For some reason they sent me through this by myself instead of in a group, so maybe that through off the timing, but one actor didn't even notice me on the trail until after I passed him and he was like \"whoops\" after I passed him. The chainsaw guy didn't even bother trying to start his saw or chase me.\n\nThe hay ride was the worst attraction by far. The wait was ridiculous, a full 74 minutes. Yes, I actually timed it because other patrons warned me the wait was very long. The wait was so long that someone a few rows ahead of me actually relieved themselves in line. Plenty of people smoking in the line too. The actual hayride had maybe 2 worthwhile jump scares, but overall not much worthwhile happened. Several people in line complained that they waited so long at the hayride when they finally were through the other attractions were already closed for the night. I would have been super disappointed if I had paid $25-$30 for 1 attraction!\n\nI'm not trying to bash the event or anything, I'm sure it's difficult to run a haunted house, but felt an unbiased & fair review from an attendee was warranted.","stars":2.0}

I came to this place when I was on vacation in FL. since the selection of food at the hotel we were at had a very limited selection of food. It was a five minute walk near the Hyatt Place Busch Gardens to where we were staying. To those of you who don't know what Tex Mex food is, it's Mexican food minus the spiciness of the food but basically the same thing. \n\nThe place was cute and quiet when I came in the early evening. I came during happy hour and margaritas were half off-:) I ended up getting two blended margaritas for only $2.50 each. I got the sangria flavored one that the waiter suggested to me. It was blended and very refreshing to drink on such a hot day.The waiter brought them both out at once along with a basket of tortilla chips and a fairly decent sized bowl full of red salsa. The margaritas were good, but I wish that I had ordered another flavor instead as the sangria one tasted way too much like a wine slushie and I don't really care for wine.\n\nAnyways, I decided to be bad and go off my diet since I was on vacation so I ended up getting the empanadas with ground beef and cheese in it. It came with some nacho cheese sauce. I got my order in less than 10 minutes and it was good, but the problem is that the whole meal lacked spice. I had to use the not so spicy chipolte Tabasco sauce on everything and still, it wasn't spicy enough for me. \n\nThe waiter was nice and the food was reasonably priced and good and so were the drinks, but IMHO, ethnic food should never ever be bland. I don't expect it to be so hot that I'd have to down a pitcher of ice water, but not so bland that it tastes like American food.

I just like how as soon as you walk in you are seated by the owner have your coffee and food with in the matter of 10 min. They always seem to be on Point with everything. \n\nThere is no shortage of parking plenty of room. As I try going as much as possible, I try to get something diffrent to eat each time. This past time I got the eggs benedict with home fries and coffee. Just as expected everything was good. Service was great, food came out hot. And when the waitresses seem to be busy the owner helps out to get things rolling a little faster.. which does help a lot when you need a fill up on the coffee!!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Everything was ok. Service and food. They were quick to sit us and take our orders but food took some time to be made. We came in during lunch time and all tables were occupied.. so this may be reason for delay. We ordered a smoothie, raw papaya salad and the fried tofu nuggets. I liked the smoothie. Ratio of ingredients was pleasant. Was not crazy about Fried tofu. It had a texture that did not work for me however the sauce that it came with was delicious. The raw pad Thai. It was a salad, true in its form. But I couldn't register any sign that it's inspired by the flavors of both the Americanized or Thai version of pad Thai. So I tried to keep an open mind and consider the papaya salad I have had in past. But still, it is its own kind of salad which lacked in flavor.\n\nI will come again. Maybe pass on the salad but definitely check other menu items.\n\nSpace is tiny but I did not mind it. I found it cozy and decor was cool.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"As I write this, it is currently 10:52 pm on a Wednesday night. For the past hour and a half, construction workers have been using a jackhammer in a nearby part of the hotel with the permission of hotel staff. As you can imagine, sleep is hard to come by. Furthermore, when we first called the front desk to complain about the noise, they denied knowing anything about it despite the fact that they were in contact with the workers. Also, the elevators here reek of piss and weed. The bathroom is covered in dust and the bathtub's paint is peeling. I would rather sleep on the street than spend another night here.\n\nUpdate: \nIt's 11:20 and the jackhammer is still going. They promised they would speak to the person in charge last time we called, but that apparently did nothing. New guy at the desk is claiming to know nothing about construction and is supposedly sending security to investigate.\n\nUpdate:\n12:30. After speaking with the construction workers who were in the lobby, there is work being done with an electric saw. Work is literally right behind front desk which invalidates the staff's claims that they didn't know about it and couldn't hear it. Further investigation led me to discover that workers with saws and drills were crawling around in the ceiling under our room. Hotel gave us a partial refund and free parking, but that does nothing to replace the sleep we lost last night. We will not be returning. \n\nIf you are thinking of using this hotel, do not.

It was so crowded that I was sat around the big round table which was shared by strangers all eager to dive into the best noodle soup ever. Yes they hand draw their noodles right in front of you as you eat. My first bowl was the seafood noodle with hand drawn noodle. the freshest Iv'e ever tasted.

{"text":"When I was in high school, my friends and I would 'sneak' downtown and hang out here as much as we could.  This place just made us feel so cool for some reason and I laugh thinking about how we would order coffees and try to act all hip and haughty.  We must've looked painfully obvious, but at the time it was such a thrill.  That being said, I still loved visiting J J's when I moved back to Nashville for college and still do today.  \n\nAlthough it is no longer a regular haunt of mine, I still enjoy stopping in here from time to time.  J J's is such a unique place, there is nothing like it in Nashville.  It is labeled as a Market and from the outside, looks to be just that.  The exterior is that of a boring, typical corner store and tricks you into thinking it'll hold the regular types of market merchandise, ramen and toilet paper and other generic products household products.  But entering J J's you find a much more tasteful and exciting selection of domestic and imported wares.  There's a large stock of higher end chocolates, in more varieties than you would expect.  They sell a surprisingly good selection of teas (lots of loose leaf yum) and coffees, some local, some not.  And an eclectic mish-mash of higher end grocery items.  Now granted J J's is small so their collection is not too incredibly extensive, but it's a great place to stop and pick up some odds and ends on the way home.    They also have a decent selection of cold beer, a lot of nicer breweries you can't find in your typical corner market and the sell kegs as well.  \n\nWhat sets JJ's apart from other places isn't their amazing taste in merchandise, it's the atmosphere.  The market is only half of what makes up this place, my favorite part of JJ's is their 'lounge' area.  If you walk past the front counter you enter the back room which is a cozy little area filled with worn in chairs and tables.  On this side of the store, the front counter is turned into a coffee bar, where you can order a delicious version of your favorite coffee drink.  The 'lounge' is stocked with battered board games and reading material, and spending time here feels more like hanging out at a friends house than a local business.  I love meeting up with a couple friends here, grabbing a coffee and relaxing, playing one of their games or just chit chatting quietly.\n\nThe staff here are some of the friendliest in town and are always ready to help in anyway they can.  The prices are a little high but not more than expected as most of their merchandise can be hard to find anywhere else in town.  Their location on the Vanderbilt side of Broadway is in very convenient walking distance to a lot of hotels if you're a visitor, dorm rooms if you're a student, and lots of local businesses including music row, if you're looking for a spot to stop for a coffee break or an informal meeting.  This convenient walking location also means it can be a terrible parking location.  Spaces are extremely limited close by and on busy times of the day, you will probably spend more time looking for a spot than you will drinking your coffee.","stars":4.0}

There is a wide variety and selections of colors and glitter. \n\nThe store is very clean, and very quiet. There are plexi glass windows at each station and pedicure station.

We were served water and my water had something black and fuzzy in it so I asked her for a new glass of water which she was very kind about. \n\nMaybe there was a person training but a male server kept dropping things on the floor and having to bring back to the kitchen which didn't seem sanitary. He looked confused, stressed and sweaty. \n\nNormally when you go to a restaurant your meals are served at the same time so one or two people in the group don't have to wait awkwardly drooling in front of their food, but that was exactly what had happened at Cozara. \n\nFood was pretty good and they have some good lunch deal.

{"text":"I was sold by the $14 bottomless mimosas\/ros\u00e9. I was sold again by daily jazz brunch. I was sold yet again by the cutest courtyard tucked away off of a busy street that managed to be impossibly tranquil. \n\nWe showed up right as Broussard's opened for brunch at 10 am, and were immediately seated in the spacious courtyard. Our server greeted us immediately and explained that we would actually have two servers: one to take care of the food, and a separate for our drinks and dessert. Fancy fancy stuff. We both had the bottomless mimosas, and I really could not even wager a guess as to how many I had; yes this is in part because I am a lush, but mostly because the server in charge of drinks was SO on top of refills that my glass never even came close o half empty. It was spectacular, and the champagne itself was very tasty too, which was a great bonus because most bottomless places tend to have bottom of the barrel champagne in their mimosas. Both servers were very friendly and happy to answer any questions as well as offer their recommendations. \n\nOn one of those recommendations, I ordered the crab and shrimp omelette. I'm not typically a huge omelette nut, but this was honestly amazing. The eggs were light and fluffy, with tons of crab meat and shrimp stuffed inside; it was all covered in a wonderful gruyere mornay that was delicious without overwhelming the rest of the dish. The potatoes in the side were great as well, and all in all it was a solid amount of food. My friend had the Josephine Benedict, which was a shrimp and crab cake Benedict with creamed spinach. It was probably the best Benedict I have ever had, without any exaggeration. The shrimp and crab cake was fried crispy and delicious, and played so well with the poached egg and creamed spinach that was more of a sauce. It didn't come on an English muffin like your standard Benedict, but it really didn't need it at all. They were both spectacular dishes and good portion sizes, but I will warn that it did run pretty expensive. About $25 is what you can expect for the average brunch entree. \n\nMy one gripe about the experience was that it was kind of light on the \"jazz\" portion of the jazz brunch. The trio showed up a little later than we did and took some time to set up, then played a couple of songs and went indoors where there were other tables. I get that they needed to play for both sets of patrons, but I do wish that we had a jazzier experience because that's what we were seeking while in New Orleans.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"The Orchid Show is held annually January\/March and enormous effort is put fourth for this show; almost a year of planning and work before hand.  This Orchid collection represents one of the largest and finest in the U.S. and the garden has approximately 7,000 Orchid plants, representing 2575 unique taxa. 3202 are species.  The main display of the show is held in the Orthwein Floral Display Hall in the Ridgway Center and there are additional displays in the Beaumont Room in the Ridgway Center and in rotating Climatron.\n\nI attended the 2015 Orchid Show on a Corporate Business Partners day. The primary gathering place for the Orchid Show is relatively small. Several times there were bottlenecks where people had to stop and couldn't move around a group or person that was in front of them because they were taking pictures or talking for quite some time.  I think in an effort to control the flow of traffic, they were only allowing so many people at a time.  A suggestion I would have going forward would be to maybe have this very popular show held in an extended large area or maybe change the flow of traffic. Everything seems to go in a circle but maybe there should be other outlets because you literally have to wait behind the person directly in front of you and the walking space is not very wide.\n\nThis year there is extra added in about the amazing pollinators of the Orchids.  There is a nice display of at least 20+ different bees that only pollinate certain Orchids in certain Countries.  They range from extremely huge to very small and all of them do a wondrous job of bringing us such beauty.  All in all it was a good experience I was really happy that when I went to the gift shop a majority of the Orchids that I saw in the Orchid show were available for purchase that day.\n\nThe season for the Orchid Show is coming to an end but the weather will be very nice this weekend. Grab your family or a fellow Orchid lover and head down to the Missouri Botanical Gardens to see the 2015 Orchid Show.  The Show is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and general admission to just this show is $5.  Also, if you're not a member of the Gardens I would strongly suggest looking into that.  Membership is a great way to sustain a great cultural institution in St. Louis and also preserve this historic treasure.","stars":3.0}

They allow you to taste flavors before deciding what you want. I ordered the bubble waffle with snickers ice cream and OMG was it absolutely perfect and yummy!!! The presentation was fun!! My only complaint is the vessel which the waffle comes in because its a paper wrapper and when the ice cream is melting is comes out the paper but they had a plate to catch it but I would prefer it be something else so I can eat that melted ice cream lol. If in Nashville this is a must try!!!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"BCB is not the place I would have thought to go for dinner...but we did.  I was mostly thinking we'll have a light dinner and go big on dessert.  \n\nThe place is crawling with ladies, as my hubby so dutifully noted.  A popular place to catch up with friends over a sweet dessert or a chocolaty martini.  We were seated in the back dining room and served a bottle of water and a small plate of complimentary mini chocolate chip cookies to snack on while we mulled over the menu.  I have mixed feelings on these little cookies.  While tonight's were nice, soft and still slightly warm, the chocolate chips in them takes on a different taste after the cookie has left your mouth. \n\nI started with a Black and Red.  Chocolate Stout meet Lindeman's Framboise, the love child = a chocolate raspberry beer.  \n\nWe both decided on pizzetas, they have 6 different varieties.  I had the Benton Place (sweet potato, buffalo hot sauce, mozz and blue cheese) and the hubby had the Rutger Street (mild Italian sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic and mozz cheese).  We swapped a few slices with each other, both were good in their own respect.  The Benton Place was a lot like hot buffalo wings without the wings...if you follow me on that one.  Not your typical pizza by any means, at first I wasn't sure about the blue cheese...but it grew on me by the second slice.  The Rutger Street (one of their most popular pizzetas) was more along the lines of your savory traditional pizza.  \n\nBy the time we finished we were too full to read about their rich, decadent desserts.  Emotionally bummed I didn't get dessert.","stars":4.0}

The cheese plate was wonderful--we took a chance and let the chef choose our cheese for us and I'm glad we did.  The cheese plate was a wonderful value--it came with substantial portions of all three cheese, a nice spread, and an entire bowl of fresh baguette.  You never know what you're going to get for your money when ordering a cheese plate, but Bluebeard didn't disappoint.\n\nFor my meal, I had a side of brussels sprouts and the pappardelle, which the chef made meatless for me.  SO good.  Husbo had the ramen, which I didn't try, but looked insane and also wonderful.  He was pleased.  We finished with an amazing dessert of panna cotta, pawpaw custard, toasted marshmallow, with some crunchy molasses-y goodness crumbed on top.  Ugh.  I feel emotional just thinking about how good it all was.\n\nThe service was excellent and the atmosphere was great.  Definitely a pricey meal, but really reasonable given the quality of the food.

Upon entry, the hostess is extremely friendly and seated us quickly. Make sure to make reservations a few weeks before you plan on coming because they get booked quickly! \n\nStarted off lunch with salatim (ikra, tabbouleh, and Bulgarian feta). All were delicious! The Ikra was creamy and I loved the salmon roe. The tabbouleh was light and refreshing (if I had to choose this one would be my least favorite of the three). The Bulgarian feta was perfect with the fresh pita bread. \n\nNext, we had the brussels sprouts hummus and the shakshouka. The hummus was the highlight of my meal - so smooth and creamy! The brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly and I loved the hint of spice.  The shakshouka was also good and something I don't normal order. But the runny egg and roasted parsnips were too tasty.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor was simple. All the dishes were presently nicely and portions were larger than expected. My only criticism is that the waiter made my table feel a bit uncomfortable as he only made eye contact with one person at the table. But otherwise, I would come back to Saba again and would recommend to my friends.","stars":4.0}

My girlfriends and I came to dine early Saturday evening with a prior reservation - we were seated right away. The atmosphere was nice but borderline pretentious, but did not go well with plastic glasses and outdated\/plain dishware.   Live performance was a cute touch - however it looked as the performers were only signing for the regulars.  We never got approached to request a song, whereas older people at the next table did.  The food was mediocre to say the least  - canned mushrooms in the pasta sauce, overcooked gnocchi, octopus dish that tasted like it came from a can as well. White Pizza I ordered was dry and plain. Although the waiter was nice and polite,  I had to ask for a manager to inquire about ginger ale that was charged 4 times.  Apparently, no free refills for soft drinks.  Be sure to ask the waiter, as it's not written anywhere. The manager was EXTREMELY rude about this matter - he talked to me like I was his friend:-0    \"hey, listen....\"   - that's not how you address your customers! Overall, my upset stomach, $10 gingerale and offensive manager left an unpleasant first impression of a \"pizzeria LaScala wanna-be\".

{"text":"Our waitress explained the reason for the new format (some tapas elements - small plates\/large plates, and other changes underway).  The former owner-chef and his partner had an opportunity to move to the Keys and be involved with a restaurant there.  Sort of an early semi-retirement, getting down to the Keys many years earlier than they'd originally thought would happen.\nThe new chef is the brother of the former chef.   And this was real chef-cooked food.  I don't know how the chains, like Outback\/Carabbas\/Longhorn\/Bonefish, prepare their food, but I tend to think of them as having some kid in the kitchen putting pre-packaged food in the oven.  Maybe that's unfair and it's better than that, but this was real chef-cooked food and it showed in every dish.  Appetizer crab cakes:  excellent with wonderful herb-flavored mayo-type sauce, and real nice greens and some kind of large chip-like things - I guess you could put them over\/under the crab cakes sort of sandwich style.  Tomahawk steak with two sauces - have you ever seen eel sauce with a steak??!! - and it worked - just terrific.  And a pretty standard horseradish cream sauce.  Brussels sprouts sort of stir-fried with some other things - including mushrooms and onions(?).  And some kind of garlicy mashed potatoes but texture sort of polenta-ish - not sure what I was eating.  \nThat's everything we ordered, so I'm projecting a bit to give 5 stars, because it's based a little on plates I saw at other tables.  Like a charcuterie plate and desserts.  And we didn't have drinks, but I saw people at the tiny bar - I hope they still have the local drafts.\nService:  Excellent (multiple servers checking that everything was right), although our waitress forgot to announce specials.\nI don't think the tapas-type small plates\/large plates format is on the website.\nAmbiance is not quite the same as the old Green Springs (decor, music, etc.) but the food is excellent.  My biggest reservation is that it seemed a little pricey, so if I could have given it 4 1\/2 stars because of that, I would have.  The website doesn't show the new menu\/new prices.","stars":5.0}

We had some tough critics as guests who made a point to tell my husband that they unanimously agreed that the food was the BEST wedding food they had ever had.  We had a southern buffet with pulled pork and brisket and everything was absolutely wonderful even the simple garden salad was impressive! When we had our tasting, we made ourselves nervous by asking for the recipe for the delicious beer-braised brisket to be changed to accommodate a gluten menu; so the chefs made for us a balsamic brisket; it too was just amazing and tender.  Our issues with gluten was treated so professionally as non-issues. They so smoothly accommodated in this and everything. \n\nEveryone at McConnell House from the managers to the wait staff to the chefs were super friendly and helpful.

They do their best to make sure you're comfortable while pushing you at the same time. They get to know you as a person and going there is an enjoyable experience. I've been to many physical therapy offices for a series of injuries in the past. I've never come across a place like this. This has been the only time I ever looked forward to going to physical therapy. I went once for a neck injury that made me miserable. They got me back on my feet again. I went back a few months later for a different injury... once again an enjoyable experience and helped me heal. Totally recommend!! I hope I don't ever need physical therapy again, but if I do this will be the only place I consider!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"We found Britt & the Philly Home Girls via reviews on Yelp and testimonials on various other sites.  We were torn between renting and buying, and neither of us are from Philly, so navigating the house market and the various neighborhoods was difficult.  We were really looking for not only an advocate, but someone who would help us pick the right place for us.  \n\nAfter several bad matches with other agencies who only sent us listings we weren't interested in or only wanted to show us homes they wanted to show us, we set up a meeting Britt.  It was perfect - she actually wanted to talk to us about what we were looking for, our priorities, and what timeline we were on.  And when she sent us houses to look at, she took feedback on what we did and didn't like, and directly incorporated that.  She was just as attentive and supportive through the rest of the process.\n\nWe couldn't have asked for a better experience, and we would wholeheartedly recommend Britt and any of the Philly Home Girls team to people looking to buy in Philly.","stars":5.0}

My reason for 4 (vs 5) stars is simply location but more on that shortly.\n\nRoom - pros: mattress, TV, spacious shower; cons - a little tight... \n\nFood\/Drink: pros: everything! Breakfast wow. Lunch heck yes. Bar program holy amazing thank you. Cons - only that i didn't try dinner (yet)\n\nService: Pros: for a new hotel their hospitality is buttoned up from A to Zzzzzzzzzz. Cons: not a single con. \n\nLocation: pros: 1\/2 mil from Bdwy. overall great. Cons: being in a room in the back of the hotel led to loss of sleep. It is overlooking and overhearing printers alley where noise of music and patrons echos up the alley walls and into your room. Ear plugs required especially for the light sleeper.

{"text":"So in my former life, I used to travel all across the south as part of my job and I always found myself looking for something to eat in small towns and cities that I didn't know much about.  I love chinese, thai, indian and caribbean food but you can't always trust restaurants in small towns because they tend not to be that authentic. Well, one of the tricks I learned from an old school foodie that I used to work for was to look for \"natives\" eating there.  And not natives from that small town but natives from that culture.  That's what told me initially that I was in the right place when I walked into the Golden Phoenix.  Tusconians native to Asia usually outnumber the regular locals in this spot and I never see them touch the buffet.  Follow their lead, order off of the menu and thank me later.  I usually order carryout and they don't take kindly to a lot of custom ordering and \"tweaking\" of ingredients so don't get all complicated when you place your order.  But if you stick to the printed menu (good luck finding one on-line), you won't go wrong.  This spot does not look the part but park in front, watch your tail when you are backing out and make sure you call ahead for the duck (damn good).","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Not really sure where to start with this review. We checked in on Wednesday, the week of the 2019 Essence Fest. Walking into the hotel, I didn't get a good feeling about the place. There was a terrible stench, that was even in our room (we'll get to that later in the review). The check in clerk at the \"front desk\" really wasn't welcoming, no smiling, no greeting saying \"welcome\" he just said, \"are you staying here?\" Honestly felt a racist vibe, but we'll get back to that. The air conditioner in the lobby area did not work so on top of being smelly it was extremely hot and humid. The place looked dusty like it needed a deep cleaning. You could literally see dust all over tables and furniture.\n\nUpon entering our room, 204 to be exact. There was a terrible smell. Kinda like an old funky basement smell (this smell stayed in our clothes, we immediately washed everything we got home, and deep rinsed) . I loved that it had a loft look to it, with the bed being upstairs, with a half bath. There was a couch upstairs by the bed, but it had a HUGE dent in it, which had us scared to sit down on it at all. There was a tiny little mirror in that bathroom as well. The downstairs was ok, there was a couch, and chair, a microwave, and a tiny refrigerator that didn't work. The bathroom was decent, however there was dirty standing water in the tub when showering. So ultimately we had to get out of the shower and wash our feet and legs in the sink, because we were standing in dirt. \n\nThe swimming pool was DIRTY! It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. \n\nWe had our baby with us, and it was hard getting around the hotel and out to the street because of stairs and tiny hallways. There was a nice gentleman that showed us an exit to the street that made it easier, however the next time we attempted to use the exit, an older lady pretty much reprimanded us for it, saying that we couldn't go out that way and we had to carry our son's stroller down the stairs. However right after, we saw another couple walk right out of it and she said nothing to them. There was a racial difference in us and them. Speaking of, every time we entered the lobby the employees would stop speaking and stare at us making us very uncomfortable. On our second to last night we saw a bunch of other African Americans checking in which made us feel a little better. However, they also told us that they were treated \"oddly\". \n\nI did like that the hotel was literally one block from Bourbon Street so we never had to Uber to go have fun. \n\nThis Hotel wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. I think they should clean it up and turn it into a nice bed and breakfast because that's the vibe we got from it, which was actually nice.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I haven't even sat down yet, and I am already ticked!!!! My hubby wanted to come out to eat so he chooses bonefish grill. We call ahead to see if we can put our name on the list. The woman I spoke to said that you had to physically be there to put your name on the waiting  list.  And,  she also says to me that by the time  we get here the line shouldn't have moved that much.  Yes,  that sounds a bit backwards to say,  but that is what she said.  Ok, so I get here with my hubby, and my 3 children (10yrs, 9yrs, & 8mo.) And I am told  there is a 45 minute wait.  However,  there have been a few people to come in and said  \" I had a reservation at ....\", and were immediately sat. I also overhear the hostess on the phone with another potential customer.  And,  she explains to them that the earliest reservation time they have is at 830pm. So when she hangs  up,  I tell her that I was told you have to be physically in the restaurant in order to be put on the waitlist.  Now the issue is,  that she didn't bother to explain to me that if I wanted to make a reservation the time that was available.  Yes,  I said we  were on our way.  But, she never offered this info up to me. Because,  had she done so, I could have made the decision to go to a store in the area to kill time until it was near time for us to be sat.  Or,  we could have  sat in the car  instead of standing up near the doorway & hostess stand with my family. And,  then when I asked  for a mgr, nobody ever went to get one.  So let's see if the General manager reads this complaint! !!! * update  to my review, yes this is the same visit, unfortunately!!! They are out of the shrimp pad Thai that I ordered,  and then they take forever to bring my husband & children their order.  And,  as soon as we call a gentleman over assuming he was the mgr, we tell him we are just going to leave, that is when someone not our waiter comes up carrying the food.  Just an overall horrible experience!!! Be forewarned,  there are other quality restaurants nearby!","stars":1.0}

Their shrimp cocktail is famous for a reason and if you have a cold, as I did on my most recent visit, it is useful for opening up the sinuses. I was impressed that the waiter was genial about my husband and I sharing a 28 oz bone-in rib-eye, which when split was still a healthy portion! The side of creamed spinach was excellent as was the meat - a little undercooked, but again, no frazzled expression when we asked for a minute under the broiler.  \n\nWhat surprised me on this visit was dessert; I'm pretty sure I haven't had it there before. The waiter recommended the special blueberry bread pudding and it was SO good that I ate way more than I intended to. I'm pretty sure they were trying to single handedly raise my cholesterol in one evening. \n\nOne word about wine: the imports were not marked up as aggressively as the domestic wines. We enjoyed a Barolo that was off the beaten path of the wine list and it was a much better value than the California Cabs of equal price.","stars":5.0}

Our reservation was for Saturday night at 7 PM. Before we could even get to our table we were informed they were out of the duck. Next, one of our party ordered a particular cocktail and was told they were out of the necessary ingredients to make it. When dinner was ordered two people ordered steak only to be informed there was one steak available. One steak available at 7 PM on a Saturday evening. I asked our waitress if she was certain there was one left and she said that she had gone back to the kitchen and that there was one. Untrue! There were none available. Excuses of a to busy weekend were what we received.  OK, we could go with that, however we could not understand how a restaurant that was not busy could allow for such lamentable service. Arriving at 7PM, drinks approximately 30 plus minutes later, salads at almost 8:30PM and dinner at 9PM was to much. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed.

They made the food quickly as I watched, delivered it to me with a smile, and  I got that and a bottle of water for less than $8 (especially surprising at the airport)!\nBurrito was tasty -- tortilla fresh and soft, bacon, eggs and cheese tasted fresh, and they were generous with the salsa.

They always will take time to answer any questions you have. When you sign up you get some free personal training which will get you on the right path to start.\n\nI've always been wary of gyms and the terms you sign as they often involve your social security number, a drop of blood, and your first born. It was not the case at this one, I felt the terms of the contract were very reasonable and they allowed a drivers license number in lieu of a SSN.\n\nThe people are friendly, I haven't had a bad experience. There's no dudebros or gymbos, nobody seems to hog machines, and I haven't seen anybody doing curls in the squat rack. \n\nThere are private showers\/restrooms, so you can go in the morning before work and get showered and dressed in no time. There's never been a time when all of them were in use at the same time and unavailable for more than 5 minutes. They are very good about keeping things clean and they do enforce the \"wipe down the machines when you're done\" policy.\n\nThe reason I put 4\/5 is because of the size of the gym, unless they expand greatly, there will always be times that certain machines will be unavailable. I'd say the cardio machines are the ones in particular you'll see this with because you don't do just 5 minutes of it. For the most part you won't wait more then 20~ minutes for one to open, and there's always something else you can do.","stars":4.0}

Frank (a supervisor) took my information and was going to follow up since it was the weekend. NO calls, NO emails, NO response to my voicemails, and NO response to sent emails. I went to their facebook page and sent a private message and the response was to block me from the page and basically tell me it doesn't matter because everyone loves them\nThere are other choices for parking...choose them.

{"text":"I'm sure this place doesn't need my review, but what the heck.  Here goes...\n\nI was told by several people that I needed to choose between either Pat's or Geno's when visiting Philadelphia.  By sheer chance, I ended up going to Geno's.  After all the hype, I was really expecting an amazing cheese steak sandwich.  In actuality, I thought the sandwich was just alright.  I was good, don't get me wrong; but I was expecting a mindblowingly tasty experience of orgasmic proportions based on everything that was told to me.  The meat was kind of bland and dry and the overall sandwich was kind of flat.  Again, nothing special about it at all.\n\nTruth be told, I think I've had a better cheese steak sandwich in Denver of all places.  There's a place off of Broadway that I still remember as being pretty amazing to this day after having visited years ago.  But who knows, maybe I was just exceptionally hungry when I tried that place.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I think it's pretty difficult to get Asian fusion food right. Chifa certainly has a few items that are terrific, but also a lot of dishes that slightly miss the mark. The other thing I've noticed about Chifa is that everytime I go, I think the food is overseasoned. I get that burning sensation on my tongue from over-saltiness as well as just being really thirsty. It's not a terrible place though and in general I am a fan of Jose Garces.\n\n- Pork belly bao buns - Really tasty. You can't go wrong with succulent pork and fluffy pillowy bao. The sauce is good too.\n- BBQ ribs - I also love these smothered in the char siu sauce.\n- Ceviche - I love ceviche in general. But this place makes some pretty good ceviche. \n\nThere's also the tasting menu if you can't make up your mind. Make sure you go with a few people (I would say 4 is the ideal number), as most of the dishes are served in a tapas style.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"So I was riding with the Tour de Liquer group and one of the stops was Molly's at the Market. I am pretty sure that TDL gave Molly's prior notice regarding that they were bringing about 100 people to their bar. Unfortunately there was only one bartender on duty when we arrived and it was a free for all on the bar to order drinks. As per usual for these situations I experienced one of the old experiences that affect African Americans. One of the unwritten rules is that when there is a bar full of white patrons who want drinks you take their orders before the one or two black patrons because you expect a higher tip than from the black patrons. I watched myself getting skipped over one to many times while waiting at the bar and left without purchasing anything. Next time on a big Sunday when their is an event headed to your business with 100 people I would hope Molly's would add extra bartenders especially for the St. Pats Day events ahead.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"This establishment has some of the finest workmanship as can be said of a salon for men.\nAs far as their services go I would like to make it clear that they are a 5 out of 5 stars with no exception.\n\nThe reason for my one star review is the consistent negative interaction with one of your employees. He has taken to harassing friends who have been to this establishment where he meets them or hears of them and takes to messaging them outside his work. \n\nUnfortunately this has an impact on this business because he is still a representative of this business as it publicly states he is an employee on his social media page, the main device with which he harasses people. Such as physical harassment in public as well as derogatory verbal assaults via Facebook messenger of people that he barely knows based on petty jealousies. \n\nI truly hate to give this badass salon a low review but honestly I will never return as a customer because of this employee. I know every customer acts all entitled like \"oh boohoo you've lost a valuable customer Blah blah\" \nI'm not choosing to ride a high horse on this one, just being honest, because if two of us already have solid proof of his harassment in the past month alone, there will have been others and there will be more. \n\nYelp is a place for honest reviews to warn customers of inadequacies within business and to tell of their successes, and this review has done that.\n\nAgain, everything else about this salon AMAZING, I can't even stress how great this place is, but because of the negative experiences directly from an employee and representative, my business and that of anyone who will listen to me or hopefully read this review, will be taken elsewhere. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read fellow yelpers.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"This is my first time checking out Dharma sushi. This is such an interesting concept; you walk into the small dining area and there are a series of ordering kiosks that you order your food at. It's a little odd since you're not seated by someone as well as your order was not placed at the counter. If you are a first timer it's a little difficult to navigate since they have so many options and you have to scroll through each and everyone of them. The menu is quite extensive they have many different options from Thai food to sushi to soups, Even tater tot's. I decided to order the deep fried sushi and it was very good. It's a very different take on sushi. They also supplied a generous amount of sushi for the price\/ for the amount you paid. It's a fun place to go with friends since you can share your sushi with other people at your table. Like I said be prepared when you go to use the order kiosks so it actually might be helpful to check out their menu online before you go that way you know what you want to order. Otherwise this is a great addition to the sushi scene here in Boise perfect for a night out or lunch  in downtown Boise. So if you're looking& for sushi this is definitely place you should try!!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This experience is like painting with a twist,  but with making candles (or anything scented) instead of painting. Personally I prefer Scent and Sip, because you can take home a nice sized candle between $16-36 that you can enjoy at home (as opposed to taking home another canvas and trying to find a free wall to hang it on). First of all, the entire experience is super fun,  relaxing and easy!!! (You're not worried about drawing straight lines and you can enjoy your friends and your byob) \n\nPLACE & AMBIENCE\u2010 there currently is only one location, located in Landsdale (with future plans for growth). 7 of us came in on a Saturday,  early evening in September fo celebrate a friend's birthday- we did public seating,  not private. The storefront is located in the middle of Main street, and when you walk into the open space,  you'll be greeted with tasteful seasonal decor and the delightful fragrances throughout the store. (The smell is not as overpowering as one might experience at bath and body works). The employees had already set up our seats. Very spacious,  not cramped- employees looked eager to help and were very kind and knowledgeable. Bonus+ they have a fantastic bathroom with all the soaps,  cream and moisturizers you need AND a changing table and diapers and feminine products available for your use!\n\nPEOPLE- the staff,  all of them,  were all so personable and knowledgable. The act of choosing the right scents and even naming your new product could be overwhelming but the staff was able to kindly guide us along. For example,  I decided to make a candle with 2 scents and the staff was so helpful to offer a 3rd complimentary scent which was perfect! They also helped us to take group photos!\n\nVALUE FOR MONEY- definitely would recommend this. Support small businesses!!","stars":5.0}

Anyone who knows me is aware of the fact that I *never* relax and as a result, my little body is tense 100% of the time.

It is a little pricey, so beware. For our entrees, I got this really unique salmon with a root beer reduction sauce.  My boyfriend got the chicken marsala dish I believe. Both were quite tasty. For desert I got the eggnog cheesecake - a slight disappointment because of the size vs. price.  Again, I think this is something you do once and then never again.

{"text":"It pains me to write this review because I really have loved TT and been a loyal customer - I think the pizza is good (4  -4.5 stars good!), especially the white tomato pie which is garlicky and yummy. \n\nBUT, I ordered a delivery pizza in the summer (pizza + salad) and was overcharged. I only live about 8 blocks away, but it was a lazy hangover morning, and we just wanted a meal delivered. We didn't hear the phone when the delivery guy called the first time.. by the time I realized it he was gone back to the store. I called and he agreed to bring it back over (seriously, it really is about 8 blocks away). I gave him a BIG tip for coming back, reheated and ate my pizza, and forgot about it.\n\nLater I see that there is a $95 charge on my credit card. My credit card company called the store and spoke with the owner (I was on the line too) and he maintained that I had ordered 3 pizzas, a salad, and a drink, and that the charge was justified. They refused to reverse it. \n\nI am seriously surprised that they would risk losing a loyal customer over a $95 charge. When I was on the phone with them (with the credit card company) he asked for my phone number to search for the charge and even said \"oh, you have many purchases\". Yeah, that's my point, I've been ordering from you for a long time. If I say I didn't order 3 pizzas, and you can see every other order I've ever made was for a single pie, why not put the customer first? \n\nSadly, I will be taking my business elsewhere.","stars":2.0}

They have a long list of special and house specials, all of which are under $15 and delicious! Everything we had was fresh and eye appealing. I would recommend the fantastic roll and special rainbow roll for specialties, and the spicy tuna crunch was also a good twist I would recommend ( better than the average spicy tuna roll). There are many other specialties to choose from that would please any crowd. Also this is a BYOB, which is always a plus in my book! We will be making this one of our regulars for sushi. \n\nService - The waiters were attentive. Ours came back several times to check on us and refill our drinks. The food came out within 10 minutes and we ordered 5 rolls. Best service I've ever had at an Asian restaurant. Our waitress chanted \"ding dong\" when the main dish was served - nice touch. \n\nParking - Parking is easy, the restaurant is located in a strip mall with some other restaurants and businesses, so there is a large parking lot.","stars":4.0}

I asked for a replacement with tofu, and the quickly made me a new one. They were very gracious and said yes, but then tried to explain that the chicken was that color because it was roasted. I still didn't really trust it though. The brussel bites were really great. They had a nice flavor and spice. The tofu bowl was great. I was really impressed by their cauliflower rice.

There was a a pretty long line out the door, but my party of two only waited like 10 or 15 minutes. Once we were seated, though, the service became annoyingly slow. We first ordered the taste of New Orleans, which includes small bowls of read beans and rice with sausage, crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, and jambalaya. All of the dishes were pretty tepid. The red beans and rice with sausage were, at best, average to me, and I feel the same way about the jambalaya. I did enjoy the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, though. Next, my s\/o ordered the catfish platter, and I nibbled off his plate. Sadly, we were accidentally brought out the fried seafood platter and had to wait quite awhile to get the catfish platter. Once it came, I was pretty underwhelmed by the fried catfish. My favorite parts of the platter were the hush puppies and the fries. All in all,  based on my 2 experiences, I'd say this place is hit or kind of miss. I should have stuck with the oysters.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"\"I am not a plant.\"  \n\nThat's an odd statement to begin a Steakhouse review.  I feel the disclosure important as I begin with what sounds like marketing jargon....\n\nSullivans keeps getting better and better.  Last year my wife and i were turned on to the Sullivan's happy hour by virtue of some gift cards.  Actually about $200 worth and that's a lot of happy hours.  We dutifully completed the challenge.  Over the course of a few weeks we must have eaten on the bar side 6 times.  My opinion of Sullivans is based on this experience and a recent trip. \n\nThe Sullivan Happy hour is one of the better deals in town.  My favorite is steak trite, which I think is around $6.   Yes a steak for $6!  It's not a fred flintstone size, but certainly adequate and always well cooked.  That's what they do.   Service always depended on the server, meaning I detected little in terms of formal training.  \n\nThey were accommodating with my wife's dairy-intollerence.   Often that requires extra effort and they never hesitated to offer.  30% of the time something went sideways with our order.  Wrong food, vanishing waitress or misplaced order.  In each instance the manager came to the table and corrected any errors and apologize. I appreciated his focus on customer service and being accountable.  \n\nFlash forward to my most recent dinner only last weekend.  Servers were pleasant and well trained this time around.  Katrina showed a great personality.  Food was all good.\n\nIn conclusion, a few months ago I would have said Sullivan's has a terrific happy hour with some average service.  Now I see they've taken the customer experience to the next level.  \n\nNote:  The staff gets extra credit b\/c they recovered my wallet which I must have left on the table.  I called the next day and picked up my wallet with all the cash still inside!","stars":4.0}

The wedge salad was decent, nothing spectacular but good.  The pizza was great, I really liked it! The mac and cheese itself I did not think was anything particularly special, it's more of that creamy mac rather than a real cheese cheesy mac - cheese people you know what I mean.

{"text":"Food here is more to share - not really any sigle entr\u00e9es to eat on your own. \n\nIn terms of taste I'd probably rate four stars but because the food we ordered was drenched in grease, I bumped it down a star. My friend and I got the chicken chicharrone, Poutine, and roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts with their cookie in a skillet for dessert. \n\nLet me warn you ahead of time - the chicharrone is loaded with oil...every bite has juices running down your throats and it's a very unpleasant feeling. The waitress suggested that we wait until it cooled down to taste but then it was just cold juices running down our throats...my friend and I could not finish it. Plus 7 dollars for like four pieces of chicken skin?? Not worth it. \n\nThe Poutine and cauliflower with brussels were much better in terms of taste and texture - however I feel that they definitely skimped on the brussels sprouts - there were like two sprouts...and the rest were just sad little leaves which made me really sad because I love Brussels sprouts. The Poutine was quite nice - fries still had a crisp to eat even after being loaded with cheese, onion, and ground beef although again, super greasy.\n\nThis is just personal preference but I wish the cookie had been chewier and softer - I suppose because of the way it's baked on a skillet, it has much more crunch and crisp so if you like your cookies that way, this would be great for you. I did like the ice cream on top but the chocolate chips sprinkled on top was a bit excessive to me.\n\nIn summary - give this a try if you do not give a crap about clogging your arteries because it is honestly a nice place to indulge and the menu is quite interesting...but if you're looking for a good meal that will leave you feeling satisfied and not like you're going to succumb to a heart attack in the next ten hours, you should probably go somewhere else.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Bistro Praha caught our eyes when Joe and I had the Hungarian sausage on the last Dishcrawl we attended. The rest of the menu looked interesting and last Sunday we managed to finally give it a go. During my Europe trip before I graduated, I actually visited Prague for a couple of days. It was one of the more interesting cities I had been to, rich in history and architecture and the old world Eastern Europe feel versus the Westernized worlds of the UK and France in comparison. For some reason, I can't remember what I ate there as my main meals, and all I remember are sausage stands open late for the nightclub crowd. It'd be interesting to see what Czech food is like, albeit in Edmonton!\n\nFor a Sunday night, the restaurant was doing pretty well - most tables occupied around 7pm. Inside, the dining area is divided into two sections. We were seated in the main area, a prominent light fixture above us from a curved ceiling, and artworks depicting the old Prague throughout. Our server was kind, very speedy, and very relaxed throughout the night.\n\nTheir main specialty is schnitzel, a thinly pounded boneless meat, covered in bread crumbs and fried. Different varieties are available to order, the traditional being the Wiener schnitzel, made from veal. To cover our bases, we ordered an appetizer, two different entrees, and a dessert to share.\n\nOur appetizer was the fried breaded cheese, a Czech dish. Usually made from Hermelin or Edam, the thick cut cheese is breaded and fried, served with a tartar sauce, as was traditional during the Communist period. The crust was super crispy, not greasy at all. The cheese was Edam and just the right thickness for it to ooze out as soon as you cut into it. By itself, it tasted pretty much like hot, crispy, gooey cheese goodness. With the tartar sauce though, tasted even better! It came with a choice of potato salad or pan-fried potatoes. Our server recommended the pan-fried potatoes and thank goodness he did. So good! Medium cut slices, fried until golden brown, not greasy, and was seasoned very well. Very addictive! I love cheese...\n\nEach main entree comes with a side of green salad or tomato and onion salad. Both regular salads, nothing to get excited about.\n\nOur dinner came out rather quickly from the time of ordering. I had ordered the Wiener schnitzel, a full order (half orders available), in order to share with Joe. As a star dish of Vienna, it's also popular in Czech Republic. The portions were gigantic! I was able to get through one piece of cutlet, while Joe sized up his portion. The breading is the same as the cheese, making the veal cutlet have a crispy exterior. It was a little under seasoned for my taste, but I believe I have a very salty palate. By itself, I was missing some sort of sauce although I knew that wasn't traditional. Alternating bites with the side of potato salad helped quite a bit.\n\nJoe ordered the filet of sole. Well cooked, nicely seasoned with herbs, salt, and pepper, and a side of buttered mushrooms to accompany it. Is it just me or is the fish and mushroom combination a bit odd? I don't think I've ever had a dish with the two, mushrooms usually accompanying steaks or meats rather than seafood. Just a thought while I happily ate my portion of the fish. The pan-fried potatoes made a second appearance, although this time they seemed to be unseasoned. Not sure if this was intentional or a mistake. Otherwise, a great dish.\n\nFor dessert, I was craving the banana cr\u00eape. This was the best way the meal could have possibly ended.  Our server knew we were sharing and was thoughtful enough to split the dish for us without us having to request it! The dish was super yummy, not too sweet, although the icing sugar (also known as crack cocaine to me) was there. Even the whip cream was light and airy, Joe questioning if it was Cool Whip or something house made. Absolutely loved it!\n\nI'll most definitely be returning to this restaurant when we're in the mood for something completely different from our usual eats. My favorites: the fried cheese and the banana cr\u00eape. I'll have to try the steak tartare and roasted duck or goose next time, under \"Bistro Specialties\" on the menu. Cute, cozy place!","stars":4.0}

Chef Carl Gordon handcrafts the extensive collection of flavors (all the classics, plus adventurous creations like \"10th Street\", \"My Ex\", Lemon Oreo, Maple Bacon).

It wasn't too sweet, which was something I am always afraid of with cider beer. One thing I really liked... they have other local beer options, even on draft, in case you don't want to drink cider. \n\nAs far as my actual experience goes, not super impressed. There was one lady, our server who seemed to be doing all the work and had the entire dining area to herself. There were maybe 10+ tables in the restaurant, so our service was pretty slow, which was not her fault. There seemed to be two other folks, a bartender and a manger not really helping out when there were clearly things to do. I didn't get food, but I have heard really good things about it.

They don't take reservations, so there's a line to get in during peak eating hours (it gets very long, so get there early).  \n\nI wanted to try a selection of what they have to offer, so I got a half dozen of the chargrilled oysters and a meal combo that included half a shrimp po'boy and a side of jambalaya.  I'm not a big fan of oysters, but you can't go wrong when they're chargrilled and covered with butter and cheese, I almost wished I got the full dozen.  The combo meal was also great, the po'boy was delicious with warm, flakey bread, but the jambalaya stole the show.  As much as I enjoyed my meal, I kind of regretted not getting the jambalaya as my full entree.  The side portion comes in a small cup, but still manages to pack in a nice portion of chicken and andouille sausage mixed in with super soft, slightly spicy rice.\n\nOverall, I had an excellent meal at Acme Oyster House, but they do fall prey to much of the same issues I've had at other restaurants in the area.  As a tourist from the Northeast, I'm not used to such a lack of healthy options on a menu, but that seems to be the standard anywhere near Bourbon St.  Acme really does an amazing job of cooking up many NOLA standards, just do not come here expecting even a slightly healthy meal.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"We pre-booked and paid for two parking spots in lot P340 for a two nights stay at the Intercontinental hotel but when we arrived at 2am on Friday, July 7th the lot was full.  I called customer service and was directed to park both vehicles in lot P-296 for the remainder of our trip.  I did not get the customer service representatives name but assumed that our reservation would be changed in the system.  Everything was fine until we checked out of the hotel on Saturday, July 8th at 1pm and found that both of our vehicles had been booted.  I immediately called customer service and was told that someone would be sent out to \"investigate.\"  At this time we still had 9 and 10 hours of paid parking left on our reservation.  Once the attendant, Brandon, arrived he told us that he did not have the authority to unboot our cars.  I called customer service back and spoke with Latoya, who informed me that they had no record of our reservation being changed and she had no authority to tell the attendant to unboot our cars.  Let me tell you that we were a party of 8 and had reservations for a swamp tour at 2:45 in Slidell Louisiana, which was a 45 minute drive.  This continued on for more than 1 hour. I called customer service on several occasions and continued to get the same response, that they had no authority to unboot the cars.  We continued to get this response from Brandon the attendant as well.  I even asked to speak with the manager, Danielle, same response.  At this time I was very frustrated due to us missing an expensive tour due to Premium Parkings poor practices and did curse on the phone.  The manager hung up on me after she continued to say that she had no authority to remove the boot.  Finally I notified the NOLA police department and they were going to come out and investigate, that's when the attendant decided to remove the boot.  Because of this did miss our swamp tour which cost over $200.  Attached you will see my 8 minute call to customer service on the early morning when we arrived at were told to change parking lots.  In addition to our screen shots of our reservations showing the times.  \nThis company has very poor customer service and is a scam!!  I believe that they intentionally over sell lots to create this issue to gain more money from booting customers cars.  \n\nDo not use this company!!!  They will try to force you to pay $90 to remove the erroneous boot applied to your car!! They will cost you valuable vacation time!!! They will cost you to miss a $200 tour!!","stars":1.0}

Mix the whole lovely mess together, add some of the bi bim bap sauce (you can't miss it; it's in a giant squeeze bottle with a handwritten label), and dive in. Heaven! The meal was accompanied by miso soup, edamame and an assortment of treats in bowls. What impressed me was that Seoul Kitchen rotates these appetizers regularly.

{"text":"Overall: A slightly cheesy dining experience but still fun & delicious\n\nFood\/Drinks: The drinks (alcoholic) are on the average to lower end and there's a pretty decent wine selection (especially if you want a bottle.) The food? Mmm.. where should I start? I'm a huge fan of the cheese fondue and the multitude of dippers make it fun to mix flavors. I won't bother mentioning the salads because they're honestly just average -- no complaints -- just average. The entrees give you a variety of flavor options and all come with dipping sauces and vegetables. I've used both the oil cooking method  and the vegetable broth; both were great. I've heard good things about the coq a vin option as well, but given that it does cost more I'd say you aren't missing out by ordering one of the standards. The plus side with the oil option is you can make stuffed mushrooms and things tend to cook more quickly but I think the vegetable broth has more flavor.\nMoving to the dessert... the white chocolate brulee is, hands down, the best option on the menu. A warning, it is very very sweet, but I think it's delicious. Be sure to save room.\n\nService\/Atmosphere: Call ahead and make a reservation. The service has always been great and waiters\/waitresses always very polite and accommodating. As for atmosphere, I know it's Melting Pot's deal to always be underground, but I'm not a fan. Personally, I need windows. Anyway, it's still a very intimate\/romantic ambiance so no windows aside, I like it.\n\nCost: If you go for the fixed price \"big night out\" I believe it's about $86 per couple (don't quote me, though. it might be a bit less.) For cheese fondue, 1 salad, 1 entree, dessert, 2 glasses of wine, a beer as well as tax and tip it was $87. We split the entree and since we had all the other things it was more than enough to share. (and now that I type it all out, kind of a deal!)","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to Blupoint, but was very disappointed! We went during Devour Indy and had a reservation at 6:45 pm on a Thursday evening. When I made the reservation, there was no option to choose inside or outside, so they weren't able to accommodate our request for outside, which was okay, but the inside was extremely loud, dark, and crowded. My shoulder was less than a foot from the other table sitting next to us. Our waitress came and we ordered a drink, which took longer than expected to get but I was being graceful as restaurants are understaffed and it is Devour. When the drink came, which was the Mamma Mia, it was 80% ice, if not more, and the ice was overflowing from the glass. It was crushed ice and looked like a snow cone. There were no prices on the drink menu, but I didn't expect it to be $14 for that, which couldn't have had more than half a shot in it. I wish I had taken a photo just to show how ridiculous the drink looked and was. We ordered our appetizer, which was an extremely small portion. I got mussels, my friend got panzenella salad, and my other friend got oysters, which were 4 very small ones. My mussels had about 10 with a slice of bread. We ordered entrees, which I got the squid ink pasta and my friends got the steak with fries. The waitress warned me that my pasta would be extremely spicy, which I usually don't like spice, but had read all the Yelp reviews prior and no one mentioned that dish was spicy, so I ordered it anyways. When I got it, it had zero spice. It was bland, a small portion, and lukewarm. I had to ask for a side of parmesan because it lacked any flavor. They didn't ask if I wanted some fresh cracked pepper or cheese when my dish came either. My friends that got steak were not asked how they wanted their steaks cooked. Both came out very rare, more than either wanted or expected. We finally got dessert for the final course, which they only had two options, both were a chocolate cake type dessert. Not bad, but again very tiny portions, and for a seafood place I would expect a refreshing sorbet or maybe a key lime pie as an option. Our waitress came back and asked us if we were ready for checks and read us our orders back to make sure everything was correct, which she read them back to us correctly. However when we got our checks, two of them were wrong. We pointed it out and she fixed them, so we paid and she came back with our receipts. My friend split her check between cash and card, and instead of the waitress asking her how she wanted to divide it, she kept the cash assuming it was a $20 tip. So then we had to fix the check again, so all around it was pretty awkward and unprofessional. For a place that seems high end, the food, service, and atmosphere were mediocre and left a lot to be desired. With tax and tip, we each spent about $80 for Devour, which was $35 a person, but our two cocktails we each got, were an additional $30 for mostly ice. If they cocktail menu had listed a price, I would have stuck to one drink and ordered a glass of wine instead of a cocktail that was basically just ice and came with a slice of watermelon in it. At least the patio looked nice with the string lights and the bathroom was clean, so that's about the only positive thing I have to say about this place. Usually I'm not this harsh, but for $80, I expected a lot better quality and service!","stars":3.0}
{"text":"When Yelp Talk speaks you damn well better listen so when I asked where I should take boo for her bday and was told Cochon I obediently picked up the phone and locked down a Saturday night 8:30 table for two.\n\nWe took a cab to avoid a parking fiasco but we actually saw a few spots pretty close by. First impression upon walking in was that it was smaller than I expected but was a pretty cool layout and there was ample room between tables. I also ran into one of my hipster friends there so I knew this place must have an edge to it. \n\nWhen the waiter approached us we tried to order our appetizers but he told us that we need to give him our entree orders as well since it was a Saturday night. This was the first time this has ever happened and I really wasn't happy about it. Especuially since there were open tables the entire time we were there. \n\nAnyways, for apps I ordered the grilled duck hearts which were the special and boo got the escargot. Both dishes were excellent. I always say when it comes to hearts don't try to over complicate them. They were lightly grilled and drizzled with a bacon vinegarette. Simple and delicious. The escargot was very good however we don't really have enough experience with it to know what's good and what isn't. It seemed to be swimming in butter (which is definitely not a bad thing) and was very rich.\n\nI looked at the menu online prior to arriving and had my  heart set on the crispy duck breast but when we got there we were told that the menu I was looking at is hardly ever updated and the duck was not available. The pork shoulder was though and was fatty, succulent, and delicious. Boo went with the shrimp and scallops over orzo (or was it risotto?) which she thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nThen came desert, unfortunately they were out of the bacon ice cream so we went with the rhubarb crumble (obviously not my chioce). It was really good. In fact everything was very good but nothing was actually memorable, you what I mean?\n\nI would have given them 4 stars for the food but feeling like we were under a time constraint was off putting and we probably won't be back for a while.","stars":3.0}

Modern decor, enough space to accommodate 70 people seated on one side but still have a dedicated dance area on the other, and awesome food. Cheryl made the planning process so easy and was full of suggestions to help us out. When we made our food selection (there was a LOT of food at our wedding) we were stuck on what pasta to have. The chef came out, explained the options and made us samples of the different dishes which was so nice and helpful.\n\nThe night of the reception the patio was beautiful!

{"text":"Look, I don't want to be a jerk, I like old things.  But I don't like dirty things, and I can tell the difference.\n\nThe bed comforter was the kind of cheap, polyester floral number you find at motels, but this one was torn, stained and clearly had sticky food bits stuck to it.  I took it off the bed entirely.  The bed itself was very, very soft, and the fitted sheet pulled off the mattress in the middle of the night because it wasn't large enough.  \n\nPerhaps most strangely, none of the lamps in the bedroom worked, and there was no overhead light.  I switched the sockets around, switched bulbs around, and I couldn't get them to turn on. \n\nAll of this probably still would have earned the hotel 3 stars, but the bathroom pushed me over the edge.  The shower is in desperate need of an upgrade - yes the hotel is old, and yes it is quaint, but there's no reason to be using a shower head from the 70's.  The tub itself wouldn't drain and before i got too far into my quick shower, I was ankle-deep.  This isn't a big deal for most people, but it is a kind of intense pet peeve of mine.  One of the drinking glasses in the bathroom had a thick crust of detergent all over it (at least, I hope it was detergent) - no big deal, but I'm surprised housekeeping didn't notice.\n\nI dunno, it's a hard judgment.  The hotel is QUIET and that's a miracle.  The staff is well-intentioned, though maybe a little rough around the edges (the doorman told me I \"looked tired\" ).  \n\nMy overall feeling is: for the price, there are other boutique hotels in the area that are better, and there are plenty of chain hotels that at least have draining shower tubs.  \n\nThis might also be totally wrong, so really take this last part with a grain of salt: I think I might have overheard some elderly Japanese guests getting scammed.  The concierge told them as they were checking out that they needed to pay a $10 telephone fee, and a $3 safe fee.  They insisted that they'd already paid for their rooms.  The man made no real effort to explain the charges to them, and at one point the woman held up her cell phone and asked, \"How can there be a phone charge if we used our cell phones?\"  The concierge said, \"Oh, okay, I'll remove it,\" and then told them that it was \"Louisiana state law\" that they be charged a tax for using the safe.  ???  They paid the $3 and left.  \n\n(my room was comped through my employment, so I didn't have to deal with any of this myself)","stars":2.0}

So we had to ask for a menu then wait for all the glasses to be brought out.  There were no recommendations or features talked about. It was standard Denny's fare.  What would you like or are you ready yet?  We were also informed the steaks were a la carte but their generous garnishes can double as sides(stack of pomme frites and broccoli, cauliflower and tomato).

The artwork has a local theme (like a glow in the dark Kelly Ripa called a Kelly Reaper) which is a nice touch. \n\nThe biggest downside is that the course is very tight. This means that other golfers will sometimes walk on your green as they have nowhere to stand on their own or you'll finish a hole and awkwardly have nowhere to stand while you wait for the next one to clear. It's a minor annoyance but could easily have been solved with just a little bit more room.","stars":4.0}

It is almost always #1 on Yelp - for years now!\n\nWe brought my parents here to have an early celebration of Jewish New Year, and I ordered some of my previous favorites for the table: Haloumi with dates, and the Cauliflower, and of course the salatim and hummus.. The spread of interesting salads is always a great way to start and get people excited about the meal. This is my favorite part of Israeli cuisine: the little salads with fresh produce and exotic spices.\n\nAmong our other dishes (and the restaurant week menu allows a table of four to try basically 20+ different things), the favorites were the potatoes, the sable, the lamb merguez, the duck kebabs, and the halvah mousse dessert.\n\nZahav is really a dining experience, and I love that it shows the diversity of Israeli food. I think you could come back here 10 times and still be excited by the surprising flavors, delightful ingredients, and of course the friendly service.","stars":5.0}

I noticed some people complaining about the serving sizes. Those people probably really like TGIF and Chillis too.. The ingredients they use at Opal are fresh and cooked to order. Anyone with experience in fine dinning will acknowledge, this is a place for a great meal. There were so many great tasting items on their menu, A 3 course meal is a must in this restaurant. The Prices were more than affordable, especially for the quality and time spent preparing such meals. \n\nWe had the \n\nShredded Phyllo Wrapped Tiger Prawns, Flash Fried Served with a Coconut Curry Dipping Sauce\nSauteed Chicken on Penne Pasta with a Homemade Chipotle Cream\nVegetable Napoleon with a Gorgonzola Potato Cake and Wild Mushrooms\nWild Mushroom Stuffed Chicken Breast on Fresh Herb Risotto\n\"Like Water for Chocolate\" Surprise \n\nAll of them were note worthy and very well thought out dishes.

The food quality, variety, and creativity here is impressive and hard to match anywhere else, perhaps Bowl or Lulou's.  The patio area is also very nice in nice weather.  The one drawback is the parking lot which is tiny and be very careful backing out, you may hit another car.  I'd be safe and park on the street and walk a couple blocks.  It's kind of hidden and looks like a house, but it really is worth it.  Forget the bad reviews here and give them a shot.  You will be amazed at their menu, or just look online.","stars":5.0}

If you love or even like beer this place is an absolute must, quite nice for us since it is literally right down the street.  Come here you will not be disappointed.

{"text":"Despite being run by embarrassingly stereotypical rednecks (once upon a time I applied for a job here and took a little jaunt into the back area) and not appearing to have been updated since probably 1973, Tanner's is a top notch grocery store.\n\nTheir dairy products are produced on-site at the farm behind the store, and it tastes it.  They produce the best milk I've ever had and the only skim milk I've had that doesn't taste like white food-colored water.  Many families I know including my own go out of their way to get their milk here even if they shop at Shop n' Bag or Super Fresh for everything else, and many are angered at the notion of going back to Rosenberger's or the like if they can't get to Tanner's before they close.  Their chocolate milk is unbelievably delicious and tastes like someone just melted a good chocolate milkshake into a bottle.  Their ice cream is also top notch.\n\nGrocery and produce-wise, everything is of excellent quality but they aren't a full supermarket and as such don't have everything.  That being said, one could easily sustain a family's common food needs here with fewer trips for stuff like cleaning products and lesser-used foods.  Their prices are fair and reasonable.\n\nI don't know where this deli is that DJ M mentions, though they do have a few unsliced deli meats and cheeses packaged kept in the cold case.\n\nThe store employs numerous local youths but people I've spoken to who used to work there say the management sucks to work for.

We had a reservation but still waited 20+ mins for a table.\n\nWhen I discovered a sealing lid for olive oil  in my bayoubaisse, the staff responded promptly and brought me a delicious substitute without an up charge. But I was surprised that that's all they did. I thought they'd at least comp our wine. \n\nThe creole tomatoes were pale and watery, and the bayoubaisse needed salt (according to my dining partners). I'd say my food--while enjoyable--was forgettable: the experience, however, was great fun with the ambiance and company. \n\nAnd the pain perdu bread pudding was amazing.

You definitely need to eat a LOT to feel like you got your money's worth, I was full after an order and a half of food.

They add pineapple which really plays well on the sweet and salty thing. Their salsa was very good as well and seemed to be home made.

When I went back a second time with just 3 friends, we sat in a more intimate booth, and the waitress was incredibly thoughtful and helpful as well.\n\nWhen I went with a large group, the food I got to try came from the shared plates section on the menu: the house nachos were very good, as were the hummus and the excellent hand cut Carolina sweet potato fries (those are really thick). \n\nMy second experience was more of a dinner situation in which everyone had burgers. My Santa Fe burger (which comes with beef or turkey) could have been excellent. The brioche bun was delicious, the guacamole fresh, and the bacon crispy to boot. Sadly, the meat paddy was so incredibly thick that the beef completely overtook the other flavors. The burger turned out to be overly messy as a result, too. The salad that came with the burger (you can pick two kinds of fries if you prefer) was fresh and nicely seasoned. \n\nI hope this helps!","stars":3.0}

After we placed our food order, we waited 40 minutes for our meals, which were subpar at best. I ordered the pork belly tacos.

{"text":"First time I've eaten here.  It was crowded and I thought that was a good sign.  It has kind of a snooty atmosphere, not welcoming and inclusive.  It is situated in a part of town with lots of poor people (transients camping right around the corner) and people of color and the words \"exclusivity and gentrification\" popped into my head upon entering (e.g. upscale for a very specific and particular crowd).  I'm not sure why people like to go eat at exclusive restaurants situated in the middle of barrios or \"hoods\" but whatever.  \nI was not particularly impressed with the food overall.  Not bad but not worth the price you pay. Stingy with the coffee...no decaf without paying more money, tiny cups.  No vegan options (what's so difficult about making a tofu scramble instead of eggs).

{"text":"I'll be forthright in saying that the only reason my wife and I visited Sakura was because we had bought a Groupon a couple months back. For the value of what the Groupon cost plus how much extra we spent while dining, it was worth the money. But would we ever go back and pay full price? Unfortunately, no. \n\nSakura is not a bad sushi\/teppan restaurant, it's just average. We did not partake in the teppan, so I can't speak for that side of the restaurant, but the sushi was decent. There are pages and pages of sushi to choose from--at times it feels like almost too much--and they are all moderately priced when compared to the rest of Tucson's sushi establishments. My wife and I had no problems finishing both of our rolls and the sushi chef behind the counter was very eager to interact with us. Not a bad experience eating sushi at all.\n\nWhere Sakura goes wrong is its appetizers and desserts. We ordered the Rangoon and for $8.95 we got five bite-sized servings of rangoon made with imitation crab. It was mostly cream cheese filling and very little imitation crab and while it was still tasty, it was not worth the price at all. The same thing can be said for the Tempura Ice Cream, which was basically a ball of ice cream with soft dough surrounding it. Again, it was tasty (it tasted like a funnel cake), but for $5.95 I would have rather just bought dessert at a grocery store... or a funnel cake.","stars":3.0}

The pork was too oil, the Chinese sauerkraut in there did not taste right, and there was no braised egg anywhere. :( While the taste was okay at best, the dish itself was below average. \n\nThe fried rice \u54b8\u9c7c\u9e21\u7c92\u7092\u996d was superb. I took away a point because the color looked bland and the taste was a bit simple -- simple, but tasty!\n\nThe pork buns were great. My only criticism is that the fillings were a touch too shy. I wish there were slightly more pork+sauce in the buns. \n\nThe almond pudding was weird. My friends liked the slight bitterness layered within the taste. My wife liked the taste of the almond milk. They disliked the firmness of the pudding. I simply thought the taste was so-so.\n\nOverall, I would have to say this was a 4.9\/5.0 experience and I'm not a jerk so the yelp review is a 5\/5. \n\np.s. we were too hungry and forgot to take pictures before the desserts :(","stars":5.0}

Whether it's takamiya, foodland, Eskimo candy, or any other top poke spot in Hawaii, if you name it, I've been there. When the poke craze finally crept into AZ, I was skeptical to say the least. After dining at a few of the poke spots in Phoenix my doubts were corroborated. When I heard about PokeZone opening in Tucson I almost completely wrote it off. If Phoenix couldn't get it right, how would Tucson? Then, word started spreading. Friends and colleagues begged me to give it a chance so I decided I would, if for nothing else, just to shut them up.

The bartender was slammed, doing the best she could with no one helping her- the manager was eating in the bakery with some of the other staff while everyone is waiting 15min for their drinks. It looked like the bartender asked for help and the manager just slowly shuffles back there to help make \"a drink.\" Finally we get our desserts, my bread pudding is cold, I send it back to get reheated, still cold. The brownie wasn't very hot either but my boyfriend said \"I'm not sending mine back, this is the kind of place that would spit in your food!\" then a roach crawls across the table!!

He devoured it before I could try a bite.\n\nAnd DEFINITELY get the ginger limeade! It was so refreshing. Not too sweet, not too spicy, but perfectly balanced. I would have partaken in the bloody mary (it was the most inexpensive one I'd seen in NOLA) but my head was still a little throbbing from fun times the night before.\n\nI almost want to deduct a star for wait time (30ish minutes and then another 15 when an order was put in incorrectly during a very non-busy weekday mid-morning), but I won't, the food was that good. I will dream of those biscuits forevermore.","stars":5.0}

Parking is in an outside lot where your car may be a block away. They beg you you not to leave anything in your car. Hmm, high crime area do you think? The fear extends to the elevators where you must enter your door key to go from lobby to 2nd floor. Also to go down as well. The elevators do not have a up\/down light indicator so when door opens it's it luck.\nCasino is the pits also. After a two block walk to a small, heavily guarded entrance where cigarette and cigar smoke will greet you. Floor is crowded with old, very tight slots. A few BJ tables but mostly odd table games with a higher rake. Poker room but no tournaments except for Fridays.

{"text":"I'll start by saying that I am from South Carolina and spent a couple months researching shops and artists so I could get tattooed while on vacation. After several searches two always came up over and over on every \"top\" \"best of\" search I typed and that was Tattooagogo and Theophile Bourgeois. In fact I found only one negative review and it was here on yelp and after my own experience I can gather that review was one littered with idiocy. I'm a tattooed pin up model, so the work I have is often in the \"spotlight\" and I wanted a rather large piece on my thigh. I knew right away after seeing Theophile's portfolio and reviews that he was the artist I wanted to work on me. He wasn't my first choice, he was my only choice. Had he not been able to accommodate me I wouldn't have gotten tattooed. After an email and phone call we were squared away. The day I arrived to be tattooed I walked into a shop that was clean, organized and felt like home. I was warmly welcomed and felt more like a regular than an out of towner. Theophile had my sketch ready and it surpassed my expectations, it amazed me how by just describing the idea I had to him translated into that sketch better than I ever imagined in my own head. As a client who appreciates tattooing as much as I do seeing Theophile's excitement about the piece only made me more proud of it. When your artist is into it as much as you are you are bound to leave with an amazing tattoo. Knowing I was on vacation Donn and Theophile recommended some places to eat, things to do, etc. When I tell you these guys made me feel like a regular I mean it. I've been tattooed in several shops where I feel like an outsider, just a pound of flesh for someone to make a dollar off of. Not here. Theophile is professional, polite and quite funny as well. I like when an artist takes his time, continually assesses the piece and makes sure to get every detail just right. If you want a beautiful piece for a lifetime, from an artist that treats you like a friend then I suggest you go see him. I know I'll be going back, he's worth the drive, flight, whatever it takes. Thanks Theophile and all the guys and gal at Tattooagogo for making my trip to NOLA that much more special. Until I see you again, keep on being the best at your craft. Y'all are awesome!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This is a review of the highly regarded Townsend Restaurant during a Restaurant Week meal here.  I can certainly see glimpses in the food of why restaurant critics have been very positive but based on my experience I can only give it a middle-of-the-road assessment.  Basically the food quality is excellent - if only there were just a little more of it.  I know I am one that has often been critical of restaurants in America serving too much food but here is one that serves too little. I get it that Townsend is haute cuisine and portions are on the small side (or you won't be taken seriously as a gourmet restaurant) but you probably need to go outside Restaurant Week and spend even more money to enjoy their taster's menu of 5 or 6 courses to feel like you have had a meal here.  A lady at a table on the other side of the room was on her mobile phone and told whomever she was speaking with that she had stopped for a snack on Passyunk Avenue.  I had to laugh when a Restaurant Week dinner is called a 'snack' but that's what it kind of is.(An expensive snack though!) I have lived in Provence in the south of France and though I probably have never eaten in one of the Michelin's starred restaurants, of course I ate out many times and in many awesome places and I don't remember portions like this.  The first course was a Roasted Squash soup which I didn't know was soup when I ordered it because 'soup' was not written on the menu. One of the two girls at the table next to me also didn't realize she was ordering soup when she chose the roasted squash appetizer.  C'mon - is it some kind of trend that you can't write the word soup on a menu?  The soup was fine - all 7 or 8 spoonfuls of it. It reminded me of a roasted pumpkin soup in Vienna but it was not quite as tasty or filling. The bread course was good especially with the addition of a pepper dipping sauce. The main course was a vegetable risotto that was most delicious and very small.  It would have been such a nice gesture - especially during restaurant week just to increase the portion even by 50%.  A wonderful Huckleberry cobbler completed the meal.  Service was cordial and efficient throughout dinner although I didn't really need to re-hear the list of ingredients of each dish that I ordered when it was served as I had just read them on the menu.  \n\nI can imagine Townsend would be a great restaurant to go to when money was no object and you could indulge in more courses than three and try out some of their wines. However if you're searching for an opportunity to try out a fine restaurant during Restaurant Week and getting value for money, I'd look elsewhere!\n\nTip - Be aware that an appetizer and an entr\u00e9e on Townsend's Restaurant Week menu incur a surcharge leaving only two food choices in each category for the original $35 charge. Many Restaurant Weeks around the world prohibit upselling on their special menus but obviously the Passyunk Avenue Restaurant Week does not.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"My sister took our family here for mothers day yesterday. I had always wanted to go to a Brazilian Steakhouse and was super excited two experience it.\n\nFirst, the owner greeted us and explained how things worked. You go to the salad bar and other buffet and get the items you want and then come back to your table and they will serve the meat.\n\nThe salad bar was nice. It had potato salad comma a few pasta dishes comma a mixture of field greens and coleslaw. I took some of the potato salad and coleslaw along with the field greens. There what's a dressing that looks like balsamic but I wasn't sure. There were toppings more so than dressings. I settled on one made of sauteed onions and a chimichurri sauce along with a tomato onion cilantro mixture that was a bit vinegary. All of it was fantastic.\n\nWhen they started bringing the meats around, the first thing I had was the pork tenderloin. It was hands down the best pork tenderloin I had ever eaten. The seasoning was unbelievable. In fact, everything was seasoned to perfection. We then had various types of steak as well as Chorizo sausage, chicken, and bacon wrapped chicken. I wasn't a fan of the Chorizo sausage but I loved the pork tenderloin and the steak the most. The chicken was also great. I ended up putting the chimichurri sauce on everything because it was so doggone good. The staff was friendly, and there was more than enough food to go around. We had various drinks at our table. I opted for water with lemon but that's just me. \n\nAt the end we were asked if we wanted coffee or dessert. We were so stuffed, we decided not to do dessert, especially because we already had a Mother's Day cake at home. But we did have coffee and everyone got something different. I had the latte which was made to perfection! I added two packs of Splenda and it was just the right amount of sweetness. The cappuccino and espresso we're both fantastic as well.\n\nSome of the meat was a bit fatty but all in all everything was wonderful. I cannot say enough about the hospitality. I also liked the decor. There were linen tablecloths as well as candles on every table. It was very elegant and intimate.\nIdeal for a family dinner or a cozy date night. The walls had television displays showing different views of Brazil as well as pictures from Carnival. I thought it was great and very refreshing, instead of just regular pictures hanging on the wall. \n\nHonestly, I feel like I took a trip to Brazil just for dinner. I would totally recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Tampa or living there. The parking is a challenge but, the food and service are well worth it. I live in Jacksonville and I asked the owner if he wouldn't mind opening up a restaurant there. My fingers and my taste buds are crossed LOL","stars":5.0}

She went to the back for about 10 minutes before returning to start the process. She picked up the different polishes several times trying to figure out what order they went in and asked other technicians what the process\/steps were. \nI figured she was new at the dip process, so I was patient. However... after letting the final coat dry for several minutes it was still very grainy and sticky. \nAnother technician came over and advised that she had not put the proper topcoat on and it needed to be buffed down (again) and repainted. \nOn the final coat, the same technician came over and ended up finishing my nails. I never got the manicure because the process took so long that my friend had been finished for well over 30 minutes already. \nI did not catch her name, but if you are going here for dip PLEASE make sure your technician has done dip before!

The seating was different due to COVID and everyone had on masks and gloves. The menu had a new item Pork Agnolotti but they still had some of my favorites. The creativity behind the menu is something one can appreciate. Limbo - the lighter side, Anger - with a little spice, Greed - richer, of course, Atonement - be satisfied, and Treachery - do it you'll love it.  Although we usually stick to The Greed section of the menu as Parpadelle Diablo and Chicken Marsala are some favorites, we sometimes venture into the Atonement secton of the menu as The Stolen Burger with Garlic Fries is just such a harmonious balance of flavors. Pork Agnolotti and Pan Seared Salmon was our choice for dinner. Everything was seasoned perfectly. The Salmon came with mixed vegetables and a Garlic Herb Rice. Had I known it was mushrooms cauliflower and asparagus, I may have asked for a substitute. They were ok, not cooked the best. The Rice had cheese which was unexpected and was covered in the Burre Blanc which made it a little mushy. The Pork Agnolotti was fantastic. My first bite made me do a happy dance. It was drizzled with a little basil oil. It reminded me of an italian version of Chicken and Dumplings. So satisfying it kind of hugs you from the inside. The meat to pasta ratio a little off, just my opinion. They normally serve Bread and Butter as sort of an appetizer. This time it was bread and a biscuit (cheddar, chile, and candied bacon) with a olive oil, parmesan cheese, garlic, and balsamic sauce. We asked for seconds. The flavors of it all BURST in your mouth. We ended with Treachery. The Adult Smore is everything and more.  Its levels of pure satisfaction. You almost feel like you are committing a crime enjoying this DELICIOUSNESS.  Perfect way to end a date night.

{"text":"Sucre was arguably the best dessert experience I had during a recent weekend jaunt to New Orleans. It appears the management would like this place to be chicer than it actually is, but the location and clientele help to keep the level of pretension at an acceptable minimum. The desserts are quite good to boot, so I'll undoubtedly return during any subsequent visits to New Orleans. \n\nDesserts: Sucre offers an extensive array of unique and well-executed dessert options. In addition to their selection of 15 artisanal chocolate flavors, they also feature pastries (croissants, brioches, scones, muffins), 10 plated desserts, 5 cupcake flavors, 10 macaroon flavors, 15+ gelato and sorbet flavors, 10 specialty sundaes, and 6 alcohol-based milkshakes. During my visit, I opted for the \"All Things NOLA\" sundae with Peanut Butter Crunch gelato, which was topped with banana foster sauce, bread pudding pieces, whipped cream, and toasted pecans. The sundae was sizeable in portion, the gelato was flavorful, and all the ingredients were fresh. In the end, my only gripe with the experience was the limited and seemingly non-imaginative selection of toppings; given the reputation of the chef, I was expecting something more impressive than graham crackers, sprinkles, and marshmallows.\n\nService: Pleasant, knowledgeable, and efficient. All orders are placed at the front counter and the items are brought out to you once they're prepared; staff members are also on hand to clear the tables once you've finished. Complimentary samples of gelato are available upon request. \n\nAtmosphere: Clean, open, and inviting. The interior is decorated in a contemporary style and the products are artfully presented throughout the store. Both interior and exterior seating options are available. Dress is street casual. \n\nCost: Expensive by most standards and overpriced in some cases. Pastries are $3.00-$4.50, plated desserts are $4.50-$7.00, cupcakes are $4.00\/single, $21\/half dozen, $38\/dozen, chocolates and macaroons are $2.00\/piece, sundaes are $8.50, and alcohol-based shakes are $10.00.

Even if it's a cute little pitcher of simple syrup, I don't want to work at dinner. That's one reason you'll never see me order crab.  This is the South. Tea is sweet. And it's just polite to sweeten it in the back. Otherwise, say you only have unsweet tea and be honest.\n2.  The restaurant is smallish. They've done a lot with the interior but the size of the building is what it is. Because of this, every time the door opened, a few seconds later, a blast of cold, arctic air shot up my back...and we were seated in the middle of the restaurant!\n3.  Noise level. OK, so I'm borderline agoraphobic with a healthy intolerance for loud noises on a good day. Something I find just grating is when a group of ladies start hee-hawing and \"hey!\"ing and single-handedly lift the noise level in an otherwise quiet establishment. Our 6 pm reservation started off with a half-full dining room, mostly couples and 2 tables with children (no, as a parent, I would not say this is a child-friendly place and, frankly, I got away from my own kid so I don't want to look at or hear yours. Date night, people.). We sat at a 2-top, chair on one side\/booth on the other table and were able to speak quietly across the table. By the end of the evening, I was employing lip reading and actually stuffed little tufts of toilet paper in my ears while in the restroom to help buffer\/drone the din of the joint.\n4.  Dessert. The \"piece de resistance.\" The finale. The zenith. The epilogue. For those, like me, who are part elf and suffer through appetizers and main courses just to get to dessert, I must say I was disappointed by the sweets offering. It was too frou-frou. Too ostentatious. Just too. As a chef, I know \"those people\" want to put their spin, their signature, on every single plate that comes out of the kitchen. But dessert is the ultimate comfort food.  It's an epicurean way of saying \"there, there...everything's going to be OK.\" I don't need 12 ingredients on a plate that's supposed to be chocolate cake. I just want chocolate cake. A really good one. And, if you absolutely have to, you can drizzle some glaze on the saucer before you plate the cake or pipe some foam reduction or cream something or other on the side and top it with a fresh mint leaf, but this is a classic K.I.S.S. scenario:  keep it simple, silly.\n\nPROS:\n1. Valet parking.\n2. Pretty inside.\n3. Service was attentive, friendly & informative without being pushy, sarcastic, indifferent, rushed or hovering.\n4.  Food was delicious. And reasonably priced.\n5.  French press coffee. Divine.\n6. Bathroom. Guys, this will be lost on you, but, ladies, it was a nice restroom. 2 stalls. Cute sink. Nice faucet. Good quality, heavy paper hand towels. And yummy soap and lotion at the ready. Also, good placement\/proximity of trash can to exit door for disposing of the \"door opener towel.\"\n\nWHAT WE ORDERED:\n- Skillet of pretzel rolls with mustard butter (appetizer)\n- Brussels sprouts, charred orange, dried cherry, peanut vinaigrette, rye onion rings (vegetable)\n- Beef cheeks, horseradish risotto, rosemary crumble (entree)\n- Josephine (hangar) steak, fries, herb butter (entree)\n- 2 UNsweet \"sweet\" teas\n- 2 coffees\n\nLink to website:  http:\/\/www.josephineon12th.com\/","stars":4.0}

When I asked why I couldn't have a table they said they were holding for reservations. I proceeded to sit at the bar where the bartender acted like she didn't want to be bothered. I had to ask for napkins, a straw for my beverage and utensils. My hongos tacos came out incorrect and instead of offering to remake them they brought the missing ingredient on the side. So guess what. My tacos where now cold. Meanwhile all the servers were standing around talking to each other while tables sat dirty. No sense of urgency at all by anyone. The service was horrible. We were in an out while all those tables still sat unoccupied. Clearly managers don't know how to turn tables as they turned away a lot of families that could have been seated and done by the time the reserved guests arrived.

It appeared they had really overbooked, people just kept walking in the door. \n\nThe actual quality of the pedicure left a lot to be desired. All 5 of us agreed we all still had rough feet. My husband actually commented on how sloppy my toes looked if that tells you anything!

A friend had the car towed with AAA and Bob was more then happy to look it over.\n\nHe was up front with me and informed me that he might not figure out what was wrong seeing as they were going to close in a few hours. I appreciated his honesty and waited until Monday afternoon to check up on progress. He gave me his diagnosis of a dead battery and no gas in the tank (my first guess but good to know I was right)\n\nHe'd finished charging the battery and starting the car a few times before calling me back an hour later to tell me I could pick the car up any time. He arranged one of his employees to pick me up (I only live 4 miles away) and soon enough I was at the office finishing up business, the guy who was giving me a ride even made a short detour so I could fill up a gallon gas tank on the way!\n\nTotal for a battery charge and labor? Less then 50 bucks. Car is running again though I have a feeling the odd smelling smoke coming out of the hood was some kind of burning off lubricant as by the time I'd driven home the smoke had stopped. If the smoking hadn't been there I'd have given 5 stars but hey, no one is perfect right?\n\nStill highly recommended for the honesty and fair price.","stars":4.0}

It was lightly fried and had great flavor. The pieces were legit sizes and not scraps like at other places. The butter sauce served alongside it was very tasty and it was a nice offering compared to a traditional red sauce served with calamari. \n\nThe entrees were even better and full of flavor. The pasta was clearly hand made and extremely fresh. It wasn't overly heavy and the consistency of the sauce was fantastic. The portions were friendly and plated really well. \n\nThe service all around was excellent and the owners were very heavily involved and it was noticed.

They also have an old school arcade game, although I don't think I have ever played it.\n\nThe atmosphere of the bar is great. They have friendly bartenders, a clean bar, and enough room to move your elbows. My biggest turn-off at bars is the crowds, and the amount of time it takes to order\/receive a drink. I give STH an A+ in this category. I get a bartender's attention within 30 seconds of walking up to the bar regardless if the seats are taken or not. The location is perfect, as well.

At first we thought it was a Cuban place based on what we read about the owners, but it turned out to be primarily Mexican with some Cuban dishes.\n\nWe went there for lunch a few days ago expecting to find something Cuban on the menu, but the lunch menu was strictly Mexican, so I asked the waitress about it and she brought out a different menu. We both ordered Lech\u00f3n Asado, one with fried yuca and the other with fried green plaintains (tostones), both come with rice and red or black beans.\n\nAt first the food tasted good, we were hungry and had been anticipating the food at El Toro. But once we dug into the meal we noticed that the tostones were definitely not fresh. They tasted like the frozen Goya variety you can buy at a supermarket. The rice was OK, but you could tell it was made in a rice cooker and not the traditional way, in an iron pot.\n\nWhile the pork and beans were OK, the dish lacked authenticity.

The staff did a great job explaining how Kamayan works and got started laying down the garlic fried rice. After that came the veggies tossed in coconut milk sauce, lumpia, lechon, chicken, and finally the whole fried fish. We got sauces on the side which included a spicy vinegar and ketchup which we appreciated since they really helped cut through the meal's richness. Every separate dish was well cooked, flavorful, and easily delicious on its own but the combination it all together was out of this world. I loved the crispy pieces of lechon and my boyfriend cleaned the whole fish off the bone.

The ban chan they offer is extensive and tasty.  Their lunch specials are a great deal.  The waiters are very friendly.  But the biggest issue is they get really busy and they are short one person, so I think I was put off that the service was a little slow.

{"text":"The Pool:\nI have been coming here for over a year now and I love this place!  My husband and I just find it to be a great way to get out of the house and unwind.  He particularly loves being in the hot tub and I love floating around in the pool at night staring up at the stars.  For pool time, we always go at night and its rarely ever that crowded.\n\nThe clothing optional part is great.  There is no pressure to be nude if you aren't comfortable, but I have seen many people ease into it over the evening.  For ladies, its nice that you can be either totally nude or just topless.  \n\nThe drinks are a pretty decent price, but if the bar isn't open outside its important that you just go ahead and order a large double.  Otherwise, you'll find yourself having to get dressed to fetch another drink. \n\nThe Food:\nI have only had brunch here, but I love it.  My favorite dish is the creole eggs benedict that comes with potatoes and peppers.  The coffee is always good and they have $10 bottomless mimosas.  The service can be slow, but as long as they keep the mimosas coming I'm fine with that.\n\nI am so happy that I found this little gem in the Bywater!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I feel so fortunate to have this little pub in my neighborhood! Pub and kitchen is unassuming, with no outdoor signage but plenty of outdoor seating that's always packed on nice evenings. They also have heat lamps that allow you to dine outside late into the fall. The interior is cozy and warm, lit with twinkle lights on the ceiling. There's usually room at their large bar and I haven't had trouble getting a table for a small party without a reservation. \n\nService is kind, friendly, and efficient. I'm five years, have never had a bad experience here. \n\nThe menu is on the smaller side and frequently changes, but their food is always delicious. While they have unique creations I always enjoy, the thing I love about pub and kitchen is that I can always get a hearty, *almost* home cooked meal. I'm a huge fan of their cheeseburger, but have loved several chicken and pork dishes they've had on their rotating menu as well. \n\nOverall, this is a neighborhood favorite I'd highly recommend!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"So I was able to see a review on another service for this place which said it was the best pizza in edmonton... I sure wouldnt agree with that statement but I am going to do a very favorable review anyhow because there is VALUE here BIG TIME.  The hook is UNLIMITED TOPPINGS.  They have the standard good selection of available toppings they will put on your pizza and one price gets you any combination you want.  The prices are darn good too.  I think it was like 11 bucks or so for my 12 inch pizza today.  They have better values on the larger sizes and deals if you get a second pizza and so on... \n\nI wasnt blown away by the pizza at all, but this is the same prize range you will pay for like a one topping pizza at the big chains and the pizza was much better then the chains will provide you.  I think I should have asked for extra sauce as my main complaint would be the pizza was a bit dry for my taste... but taste is subjective and what is bland to me might just be perfect for the next person?\n\nThe location is nothing fancy... little hole in the wall in the Duggan Strip Mall, but there is a couple tables if you wanted to go in and wait for your pizza.  They also had a couple choices of pizza by the slice available and was good priced at 3 dollars.\n\nMy favorite part of the visit was I picked up a Donair for 6.99 and I got a very good sized Donair that was jam packed with a very tasty meat.  The pita bread was soft and good and this place offers a few different choices for sause.  I went with the traditional sweet sause but they have a couple options I havent seen anyone else offer before.  The Donair was 5 star and as good of a Donair as Ive had in Edmonton.  Im definitely going back for more donairs... and probably more pizza too although I dont often allow myself the luxery of ordering pizza.\n\nAll-in-all, I think its a shame this place hasnt been reviewed more often here.  It's a little hidden gem.  The guys working seemed to really know their stuff and were friendly and quick to give service.  Im not sure if this is part of the same chain that goes by the name Canada Unlimited Pizza based out of Calgary or not... but they seem to have a very similar program.  It works. Good job :)","stars":4.0}

They had a weird taste to me, like burnt sugar or something. \nMy only complaint about the whole dining experience was the bar service. It took forever to get our drinks while dining ( we were ordering rum and cokes and wine), and the special house cocktails did not come as described. For example we ordered the \"Hemingway\" that was supposed to come with maraschino cherries, and it did not. Can't imagine a bar ran out of those, and if you're willing to try an expensive house concoction, it's my opinion it should be served as described. \n\nCritique aside, it was a very good dining experience.","stars":4.0}

We had heard about Merrridee's as being good for pastries and desserts - which they are - but they have good meals as well. The folks taking your order and delivering your food are as good as the food.\n\nI opted for the French Dip and was so glad I did. The meat was tender, not over cooked, and melted into the bread with the cheese and au jus. My wife said her Chicken Salad was good, but had a wee bit more mayonnaise for her taste. We both got our dessert to go.\n\nI feel sure that most of their pastries are quite delicious - huge sweet rolls, fudge, etc. Unfortunately, when I did get to eat mine a couple of hours later, I was disappointed that it was not as tasty as I initially hoped it would be. It simply may have been the time delay before I was able to eat it.\n\nRegardless, it you enjoy good food - and sweets - be sure to add Merridee's to your list when you go to Franklin.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I went on a Sunday afternoon to this beer garden in Irvington.  There wasn't any special event going on, so there wasn't any food available, or entertainment like a party or movie.  Just a nice open space with pergolas, a variety of tables, and a fire pit.  I will also say that going by myself didn't help any since there was nothing going on but people with their dogs drinking beer.  \n\nGetting here is also odd.  You can see the venue from Bonna Avenue, but you can't drive straight back to it.  There is a fenced off private parking lot directly north of the garden, so you have to enter on the gravel (and somewhat bumpy) driveway on the east side of Coal Yard Coffee and then drive back behind that building to use the gravel lot east of the garden.\n\nThere is a metal ramp to get up to the garden level and then most of the patio area is a wooden deck.  I did find it odd that the area by the fire pit is not level with the deck and has a different base.  I wasn't watching and nearly stumbled when I stepped off the 1 1\/2\" drop while going towards the pit seating.  \n\nDuring my visit, I didn't notice any wait staff, just a guy sitting inside the building behind a counter.  I couldn't read the handwritten names on the taps, so I had to ask what they had available.  After I learned that they don't do flights, I settled on trying their Oktoberfest (a German Marzen ale).  They serve in plastic cups and I noticed a number of covered trash cans around the patio for convenience.\n\nThe beer was okay, but not my favorite.  The patio was nice, but I could sit on my own porch and drink a beer.  I thought the bartender would be a little more welcoming when I mentioned it was my first visit and when I asked about flights, he said I should just go to the regular brewery on Washington Street.  They had no intention of serving those here.\n\nMy advice?  Watch their Facebook page for an event.  Go with some friends and bring your own food to snack on.  Otherwise, it is just a nice place for the locals to hang out and gather with their dogs.\n\nReview #3178","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Not a happy customer. We had a birthday dinner here with a party of 8 (on a Wednesday and notified well in advance). Upon entering no host was available, and no one greeted us, luckily one of the party had already arrived and I was able to seek them out on my own. Once everyone had arrived and seated the waitress notified us they only had 4 menus available (the restaurant wasn't even halfway full). Not to big of an issue we just passed the menus around. We ordered about 5 appetizers which were brought out staggered and cold. We sent the calamari back because it was stomach turning.This is just the beginning.\n\n Our server took half our tables order and left, came back 15-20mins later to complete the order and left again, another 15-20 mins she arrived with a couple of drinks for refills even though everyone had an empty glass, we remained positive and just assumed it was a new waitress or an off night, after another hr had passed we inquired on the status of our meal, the waitress explained they would be out shortly, and disappeared. Another 30 mins pass and we began to grow impatient, once the waitress returned (drinks still empty) we asked again, she said the dishes were right behind her. 1 dish came out. 1 dish. At this point we asked to speak to a manager and take the dish back because we all wanted to eat together. The waitress complied. After waiting another 15 mins with no manager in sight the host of the party went to seek one out. The manager followed the host back to the table and began to argue his point, and when I say \"argue\" I mean that literally, he said they had a new GM and she was running the kitchen, he also stated she was going to make all 8 of our meals herself in order to satisfy us (idk why he thought this was a good idea) we told him it was fine as long as they All came out together and they were hot.\n\nWell guess what another 15 mins later they arrive with 3 dishes and another 5 mins later 3 more dishes...we're still down 2 dishes. It's safe to say everyone is pissed at this point. Only half the food is warm and we've been here well over 2 and a half hours. \n\nThe waitress at this point was never to be seen again. I think she was terrified because of how pathetic the service had been thus far and didn't want to face a table of angry customers alone. \n\nWe seeked out the manager again, but he was occupied with 2-3 other tables who were preparing to walk out on their meals because they had either gotten terrible service or none at all for hrs. I almost felt bad for the manager but he was so disrespectful I wasn't able to muster any pity for him.\n\nOnce we got ahold of him we requested to speak with the GM, she came out and started with \"listen, I'll just cover your meal\".  After explaining to her that it's much more than just covering our meals (2 of which we had yet to receive), it's the terrible customer service, management, and over all experience. The GM became very empathetic and informed us that the previous GM walked out and left the place a mess, she confessed she was overwhelmed trying to keep the place functioning. We gave her our condolences but informed her we would not be returning. \n\nIf I could give this place negative stars I would. If your excuse is that your overwhelmed with a less than half full restaurant you need to find someone else to do the job or call in someone to help you. I personally will need go back, and had it not been for a birthday party I probably wouldn't go in the first place. There is a carrabas up the road, spend your money there because this place is terrible.","stars":1.0}

We ordered the weekend special which includes 3 courses and a glass of wine for only $23 which is a great deal! However, our waitress was so unbelievably incompetent she pretty much ruined our meal.\nFor starters, we didn't receive our glasses of wine until after we were halfway through our salads and the entire time we could see them ready and waiting at the bar-side for her to deliver. Finally, I caught a busser and he was willing to deliver us our wine and extra side of salad dressing which we asked our waitress to bring and she neglected to do the first time. \nThe busser and very polite hostess continued to assist us and the surrounding tables. Our waitress was not only not helping us but her entire section was not happy with her inability to properly wait their tables. She seemed so unaware and oblivious to her poor decision making that finally she got the hint from one of the 4 tables that she was screwing up. \nThe next big mistake was after our dinner plates arrived when our waitress came over and asked if everything was good and I responded with \"the food is really great\", and she replied with \"I'm sorry the service hasn't been so great, the bartender is new\". I was even more infuriated that she's was trying to blame the bartender!! Our drinks and others were waiting for over 15 minutes at the bar for her to deliver. The bartender made the drinks to order without delay and all 4 tables kept looking over there. I truly debated getting up and bringing the wine over myself!\nAgain the food was good, but the service was probably the worst I've had in years...","stars":3.0}

She showed up the next day to do the estimate, and to ask if I had any specific cleaning requests (we have pets, so pet friendly products are a must). I agreed to the price and setup a cleaning. Fortunately they could fit me in that same week!\n\n The day arrived and a team of four came by and got to work. I had a bunch of errands to run, so I left my messy house.

EVERYTHING WAS IMMACULATE.\n\nI've used many cleaning services, but these guy are my new favorite. I set-up a weekly cleaning.  I'll update this review if anything changes.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Not prepared for a pandemic.   We ordered online for curbside pickup.  After waiting for 45 minutes I had to enter the restaurant to see what had happened to our food.   Since I had expected curbside delivery, I was not prepared with gloves or masks to enter the restaurant and was in a panic.    (My husband and I are in a \"vulnerable\" group.)  Covering my face with a paper towel, I found the 2 workers ungloved and unmasked.   The hand sanitizer bottle was empty.    I should have walked away but was afraid they'd keep my money anyway.   Washed all containers and even wiped sandwich wrapping in bleach water when we got home.  None of the people in the restaurant waiting for orders were masked or gloved.  We should have known better.","stars":1.0}

The chefs always ask how our days are, and make sure you have a good time. They always talk to you throughout dinner, which I enjoy; however are respectful and don't step over any boundaries.\n\nWhat I love about this place is they have kept their prices very middle-of-the-road, while not sacrificing customer service or quality. Being broke college students at the time they opened, we were never treated with any disrespect or \"can you pay the bill\" statements (which can be a common occurrence at other venues) \n\nThe food is fantastic, and they offer a great selection of rolls (try the secret menu) and entrees that are to die for. I always refer friends to this place while inquired on quality, service oriented, and price conscious sushi restaurants in the area; and I pass this on to the Yelp! community. \n\nEnjoy some great Sushi!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This is a hard place to pin a score to, due to the fact that my scores for each category (customer service, pricing, and repair shop) vary so wildly. On service alone, I'd give them five stars.\n\nThe staff and service are great. I've always had a good customer service experience in both the parts\/gear and showroom area. That being said, Barney's is one of the more expensive places in the area. On average, their prices are about 10-15% higher than local competitors. I would probably chalk that up to the usual dealer markup.\n\nUnfortunately, I really have to gig them on their maintenance department due to current policies. I went in a couple months ago to get new tires and was told that they generally don't work on bikes over 10 model years old (mine's a 92) due to \"potential liability\" concerns with older bikes and that I would need to bring in my rims in order to have new tires put on. I understand if they wouldn't want to work on electrical systems, carbs, or other parts that are hard to find these days and\/or are somewhat fragile due to aging and wear\/tear, but telling me to take off my rims and bring them in to have tires put on is pretty absurd. It is even more annoying since I have a universal fork\/swingarm stand and would have to make a separate trip for each tire.","stars":2.0}

It's a fairly big restaurant that can accommodate groups quite well, they also have a separate room for karaoke parties.

Especially the spicy Sichuan shrimp and cumin lamb (which was initially off the menu). My favorite was the beef and ox tripe.

Their noodles are also top notch.  \n\nTheir calamari fried rice is legit if you're looking for a rice dish. Their calamari isn't fishy at all and cooked just right. \n\nThe hot crisp fish comes in abundance of fish meat in a hot pot and is bomb.\n\nOverall their Sichuan cuisine is pretty good even on par with standards compared to other major metropolitan areas.\n\nThey do serve alcohol and are willing to give you extra servings of rice.","stars":5.0}

I have a couple gripes that I think other visitors have as well.\n\nFirst, Saturday is the artisan market (more crafty) and then Sunday is the classic market (still crafty but farmers too).  So basically on Sunday morning... I am expecting farmers more than artists.  However, it seemed evenly split, maybe more crafty stuff. We came at 11 am mind you and the veggie stands were super picked over (or maybe small in general).   It's also a very very cramped plaza.  People walking into each other... craft booths were taking up clear walk paths through the plaza so occasional traffic jam.  \n\nMy thing is this.  Some people come to farmers markets to just buy food.  Just food.  Some people want to come for an experience... food, some arts, some paintings, and some kinda entertainment (music, native american talk when I was there).  Obviously, I am the other group, I just want lots of food booths with fresh produce\/product, an environment where you can walk and browse without hit someone, and pretty much that's it.    \n\nBasically we left and we went to the farmers market down the street which was much better.

{"text":"I've been to Voyeur a handful of times now and always had a good time. It is unfortunate that it doesn't get busy until around 1:30, but if you're down for dancing by yourself, do it up.\n\nThere are three floors. The lowest level is a karaoke joint until 12am. There is a bit of a dance floor but the majority of the space is taken up by a huge bar. Every time I've gone, this floor has been pretty packed. \n\nThe main level is top 40 \/ house. Whereas I generally enjoy this type of music, I've never really stayed on this floor too long. The mixes are always repetitive and drawn out. That's my own taste, though. It's just a bit light for me.\n\nThe top floor is urban and hip hop, much smaller, sweaty and, in my opinion, the most fun. The setup is a bit more low key than the main level, you can see the DJ on his Macbook, but it's dark and loud and everything a nightclub should be. \n\nAgain, this club does not get busy until others start closing down. If you go early, the cover is $2 - $5. If you get there after 11 I think, it's $10 - $15. I don't drink but I've heard the drinks are a bit expensive.

{"text":"I've lived in Ardmore for about 4 1\/2 years now and have been frequenting JHP since then. I think people get the wrong idea about it sometimes. This isn't a bar where you are going to be blown away by outstanding food or classy beers and that is exactly what i appreciate about it. What you will find if you become a regular, is that every time your walk in, you'll run into a friend or acquaintance. John Henry's is the local Cheers of Ardmore. I've seen staff come and go over the years and they have all for the most part, been great people. Jimmy and Kathy the owners are some of the nicest people I know and JP is not only a friend, but probably the best bartender in Ardmore along with Kevin over at Yeats. \n\nLike I said, the food is never going to blow you away, but it is exactly what you can expect from your local hangout. There are a lot of good options right off the bat on the appetizer menu, ranging from awesome nachos with chicken to mussels in marinara. If you're a wing lover, JHP has the best wings on the Main Line. These aren't dinky wings, they are nice and fat and you always get a good portion of them, not to mention the wide variety of sauces you can choose from. \n\nThe somewhat recent addition of the fry menu is also a really nice touch. You can order anything from waffle fries to curly fries. Favorites are definitely the gravy fries (Disco Fries) and bacon ranch fries. Other options include Irish nachos and pizza fries. You also won't find a better cheesesteak in Ardmore and on Sunday, they are only five buck with fries included. At places like Bella Italia, where they over cook EVERYTHING, your going to be disappointed. The JHP cheesesteak is the perfect mix of cheese and juicy beef. Their chicken cheesesteaks are just as good. \n\nThe one black spot on the menu is the French Onion Soup which seems to be one of the biggest complaints among Yelp users. It is always way overcooked and occasionally tastes like metal. To be honest, despite how much I love it, I don't really see it being a necessary menu item at John Henry's. If you are ever in Huntington, NY, check out Canterbury Ales. They have the best French Onion Soup I have ever had. \n\nThe beer selection is what you would expect from any sports bar with the nice added touch of a couple of rotating taps. I'm on the bar's dart team and usually just order cheap stuff like Miller Lite during matches or Sunday Football, but if I'm going for the night, they have options like Blue Moon, Guinness, Harp, Flying Fish, etc. I was actually pleasantly surprised to find out the other night that they added the Dogfish Head Punkin ale on tap which is quite possibly my favorite seasonal beer. \n\nJHP isn't just a bar to go grab a beer and a steak, they also have some great events like Quizzo Thursdays with Steve. While I don't go to that to much anymore, it's usually a lot of fun. John Henry's also does an annual road trip to a Phils game every year which always ends up being a blast. They even had their first annual Oktoberfest this year working along side McClosky's and Gillanes and seemed to be not only very fun, but extremely successful. JHP also has the NFL Sunday ticket, so if you're an NFL lover, you can go there and pretty much guarantee that you'll be able to catch your game. \n\nJohn Henry's remains and probably always will be my go to bar and favorite place in Ardmore. From the frequent regulars to the awesome ownership, if you know what you're going there for, you'll never leave disappointed.","stars":5.0}

I had my gift receipt in hand and wanted to exchange the pullover for a larger size.  I was even thinking of doing a little shopping and spending money on myself! Unfortunately, I was told that I couldn't return or exchange the pullover. I was 2 days past the holiday return date, which I hadn't even noticed or thought about since I assumed a huge company like Lululemon would give at least 30 days. It was 3 weeks for me plus I was out of town for 2 of the 3 weeks.  So, now I'm stuck with a nice running pullover that I love but cannot wear. Lululemon needs to rethink their return policy if they want to keep customers.  I will never shop there now, which is unfortunate because their products are nice.\n\nEdit 1\/15\/14.

The items I tried during the event were really good, and I was temped to order them, but I decided to give some others things on the menu a try. \n\nI told my husband that based on my Yelp event experience, they do a great job with fish, so he decided that he wanted the Blackened Snapper Tacos. I had been craving nachos, so I decided that I'd get a couple of appetizers, and we shared everything. \n\nThe Beer Cheese Nachos were so good. I loved the beer cheese and could have just eaten spoonfuls of the stuff. And I loved the roasted corn, which was a great addition on nachos. Also loved the fresh jalape\u00f1os for a bit of kick. \n\nThe other appetizer we had was the Tuna Crudo. It was good, and the sun-dried tomatoes were a unique addition, but I think I may have preferred it with avocado instead, but then I'm not a huge fan of sun-dried tomatoes anyway. \n\nThe Blackened Fish Tacos remind me of fish tacos I would get in California. The fish was lightly seasoned, so the blackening didn't overpower the fish. I would definitely come back just for the fish tacos, they are the best I've found in the Tampa Bay Area. All the others I've tried have been deep fried (I know it's a Southern thing to deep fry everything) or way to over-seasoned or over-sauced. \n\nThere are a lot of Yelp comments regarding the service, but we did not have any issues. We were seated promptly, our server was friendly and efficient, and the food came out quickly. \n\nOverall a great dinner before a game in a space that does not get way overcrowded like some places in the area on gameday.","stars":4.0}

With the Power Plate I knew I could accelerate my results and create an inner sense of wellbeing that would motivate me to keep going with my results. Because of my slow metabolism, standard HIIT or cardio-intensive workouts leave me feeling depleted.

A very nice technician named Mike came to the house and did a great job explaining his efforts and ultimate did fix my problem.\n\nThe low rating is because of the pricing structure that Riteway used.  77.00 for a diagnostics.  Expensive but okay.  Mike then replaced a single board fuse (a 10 part) and charged me 130 dollars.  Then Mike suggested replacing the blower motor capacitor, which he cited for 120 dollars.  I turned this down because I had already located the capacitor on Amazon for 10.50.  \n\nMike then indicated that within a short time, my furnace blower motor could fail, and he quoted me 1,100.00 dollars, but I found the OEM motor online for 200 dollars so there is 900 dollars of markup and labor.  I have had the same motor replaced on a sister unit within the last two years and it only takes the technician 45 minutes to change the motor out, so this markup and labor is insanely high.

{"text":"I gave this eyelash service a shot for a few months. It ended up with me getting an eye infection mainly from the technician (Akana) not being hygienic. The first time I went in for the service the lashes looked okay but not even as good as a properly applied mascara looks. So, I wasn't satisfied with the service. I followed the directions not getting any water on the lashes for 24 hours. I actually waited considerably longer just in case. By the third day, all of the lashes I had just paid $200 for had fallen out and my own lashes were broken off. I was livid. So, I called up The Beauty Place which is the new name they are working under and I let them know. They scheduled me to come in which I thought was a great indication, and I had them replaced. The lady did a decent job considering that my own lashes had broken off so badly and couldn't even support the weight of the mink lashes she was trying to put on. Also, the glue is so intoxicating it's ridiculous and it makes your eyes burn while they are setting them. At first it wasn't so bad but then the tech started using extra and blowing the lashes with a handheld fan that also dried the eyes out. It was tough. Not worth it. Long story short, getting these lashes done was a hassle almost every way I could imagine. From the elevator being out and having to walk up 4 flights of stairs just to check-in, to disgusting bad tooth breath in my face . . . yuk!! - to the offices being stifling and sweltering hot with absolutely no circulation, to the techs requiring that you sit with your head in a hyper-extended tilt for two hours, and poking you in the eye with the lashes, when a lash falls off it can poke you in the eye and scratch your eyeball. Sheesh . . . that's just some of it. I had to stop getting them done but since I paid so much for the first set it was hard to just throw that away. \n\nHowever, If that wasn't enough, the customer service from Akana (the tech that they kept scheduling me with) took a serious down turn especially after a few visits when the check-in clerk  demanded I leave the tech, Akana's, tip with her saying, \"Give me her money! I'm her sister. She wouldn't even be here if it weren't for me!\" TMI lol Needless to say, the mood in that suite was way too heavy and there was way too much attitude and nasty commentary. It wasn't worth it to me just so I can save a few mins in the morning putting on mascara. I mean, no one ever noticed I even had them done. After all the trouble of getting them done every couple of weeks, without mascara you really still look like something's missing. I wouldn't recommend this place on the lack of customer service alone and not for the money they want for a non-essential service that is such a hassle.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for lunch a couple of weeks ago - no frills breakfast and lunch place.  Seated promptly, order taken by a very nice waitress.\n\nThey rearranged the entry for (presumably) more seating.  We had a seat very close to the door and it was rather cold - not the end of the world.  Ordered the spinach melt with fries, daughter went with a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nMelt was very good - larger in size, served on nice bread with tomato.  Fries were hot and fresh and what I would describe as \"Shoestring boardwalk style\".  Not a fan.  Too little potato and too much grease.  Sort of like the basket filler you get at a Long John Silver's.  Daughter liked them though - she had half of mine.\n\nNoticed that the Roost was listed as a place to visit (!) from a customer who was in town on business.  Not sure what it says about Fishers in general, but he went there for breakfast on our recommendation and really enjoyed as well.\n\nGood local place - suitable for breakfast and lunch.  Come as you are.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This place really shined.  We visited on a Saturday for lunch when downtown St. Petersburg was busy with several events.  During lunch Harvey's 4th Street Grill got busier and busier while handling the bustle in expert stride.  As we entered, we were greeted in a very friendly manner and promptly seated.  The restaurant is designed with a tiered layout with tables in the center and a step-up to the right and the bar on the step-up to the left.  The d\u00e9cor has a dark-wood look reminiscent of a pub having a fun family friendly atmosphere.\n\nWe were not seated very long before we were greeted by our server and took our drink orders.  We ordered two burgers; my friend ordered the Alpine Burger with fries and I ordered the Plain Burger with potato salad.  It was not long before the server returned with the food; except it was two Alpine Burgers.  When we pointed out the error the server explained that she had heard me order an Alpine Burger and promptly took it away stating \"no worries\" they would make it right.  My next thought was my friend would be finished before mine returned.  I was wrong.  In under a minute a manager tapped me on the shoulder offering an apology for the misunderstanding while placing my order in front of me.  This was expertly handled in a very timely fashion.\n\nThe Plain Burger was prepared to my order of medium garnished with lettuce, tomato, and a pickle spear on the side; the Alpine Burger was topped with mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  The combination of the burger with its toppings created a delightful sensation of taste with the hot burger topped with the cool crisp vegetables.  My friend expressed the fries were hot and fresh.  My potato salad had larger chunks of potato with a hint of egg with a distinct taste of dill. \n\nThis was a very satisfying experience.  I did note that the bar area was not large but could accommodate a small happy hour and appeared to serve all types of drinks.  If you are looking for a nice place for dinner or lunch this would be it.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This is a fun family Mexican restaurant.  They have a huge private parking lot.  The restaurant itself is huge too. There is an indoor dining area, a bar area that they can open up to the outdoors and a patio area, which is adjacent to the bar. The bar has a couple of TVs playing sports. They have also some benches on the walkway in where you can sit. The area doubles as the smoking area.\n\nThe restaurant is colorful and has a classic car theme. There are pictures, hub caps (check the ceiling) and license plates all over the place. It is a neat joint and also very clean. The menu is compact, but full of your traditional favorites like quesadillas, tacos, and burritos. They have have a full bar and some thirst quenching signature cocktails and frozen drinks. \n\nWe were seated right away. And they brought out the ceremonial complementary chips and salsa to snack on. They gave the little ones crayons and a coloring sheet to keep them entertained. I ordered the beef burrito and it was huge. With a lot of their food, you choose your sauce to either drench your food in or get it on the side. I chose the boom boom sauce.\n\nThe food did not take long to prepare and it was delicious. The boom boom sauce has a little kick, just like I like it. It is probably one of the few chain Mexican restaurants that come very close to producing authentic Mexican food.\n\nThis is a nice fun restaurant and they have some delicious food and good drinks. definitely worth checking out.","stars":4.0}

My sister and I went to do some serious emotional eating, and we left feeling like a million bucks! For starters...the drinks were delightful. Followed by the bruschetta which was baller. The spicy meatballs were my least favorite thing we ate, but still pretty darn good. The spaghetti was stellar, the \"Lambotomy\" was luscious, and the bread is bright and fluffy. The \"Cider House Rules\" is my new favorite cocktail in the city...whisky, cider, with a red wine floater...I had three. They also have house-made Campari, that goes into the \"Campari Cocktial\" which is essentially an Aperol spritz: just fab. All of this was topped off by a delightful, \"not unattractive\" -to use his words- server named Moguli, who was very helpful, and provided lovely service (an area that was lacking upon my last visit) that made our night.

Nestled right off Bayshore hiding behind tall buildings, you'd never imagine this amazing EXPERIENCE was right there!\nYou must valet, they escort you down a side walk, and send you to The Door. You must knock, then be patient, they will ask for the password, and you're then welcomed in for about 2 hours of exclusive food & drinks with great service and feeling like you're back in prohibition times. \nI always want to wear my flapper dress and headband, which some do so feel free! You'll fit right in with the staff.\nWe tend to sit at the bar while we wait for our reserved table to be open, and we have just gotten lucky that there's a spot cause this place is small and can get crowded!\nMy favorite drinks: Manhattan (just so classic), Coconut Flip (no longer on the menu, but they'll still make it), and Blackberry Smash (also no longer on the menu but they'll know what it is). My husband goes for the Old Fashioned, Vesper, and I can't remember the name but it's the only one with green chartreuse in it and it's amazing.\nFoodwise: We love the sample fondue platter with bread, pears, & potatoes.

{"text":"I thought this company would be great based on the reviews but that was not the case. They were great up until they had a signed contract. First my installation keep getting pushed back, but I let this go due to being in the covid era. Once the installation started it went from a one day project to multiple days. Again I let it go. They were short handed. I requested several times to cover my pool and take extra care in cleaning up the back yard as we have animals. They left 2 holes in my year old pool cover, and it was covered with nails. I picked up over 100 nails after they left. They were all over my drive, yard and pool. One of my dogs got a gash on his paw during this time. I can't prove it was a nail but I don't know what else it could be. They did agree to replace my cover but sent me to a place that was cheaper than where I originally bought my cover, and that company never fulfilled my order. I had to end up buying from the original company at the higher price and they will not cover the difference.(As of this review I'm still waiting for a credit for the cover) They also damaged a downspout and claimed it was already damaged. It was not and has not been an issue for the 10 years we lived there. It now will not stay attached to the rest of the gutter system. Now I have to hire someone to fix it and they will not cover the cost.  Also the roofers did not remove the backing on the shingles that allows them to adhere to the roof. This can cause a big issue when the wind picks up. At this point I would not recommend this company.","stars":1.0}

This was my first raw oyster bar experience away from home, and the best thing I can tell you about Seaworthy is how much pride they take in their oysters. The worst thing is that while it's a beautiful spot, it's very small. The original table they were going to seat us at would not have held our drinks and a full tray of oysters. The bartender was great at recommending drinks, and their crafted cocktails are just delicious. He was so knowledgeable about oysters, their flavors, the regions they come from, everything. We tried a few different types, upon his recommendation, and honestly he was spot on about the flavors. I loved it. Also the presentation of the oysters was beautiful.

The ambience, the young ambitious sweet owner couple, the decor, the well thought out menu, the delicious food!\nYou feel relaxed and like you're in Florida rather than a strip mall place in Malvern, Pa. There is no place like this around. They not only put thought into the whole decor but every menu item is grain free, gluten free, organic, real ingredient, real food, made from scratch.\nI'm obsessed with the veggie saut\u00e9 sandwich, \"cheese\" steak sandwich, a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl, sweet potato fries, avocado pesto, apple pie smoothie, avocado toast with tumeric. I want to try everything on the menu!\nPlease support this awesome local place. This is the type of food everyone should be eating, not processed fake crap served everywhere full of bad things.\nGlad to have found this new gem!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This is the place New Jerseyans come to deal with the bureaucratic red tape that goes along with securing and maintaining the privilege of driving in the Garden State.  Licenses, Registrations, Titles, Suspensions, Renewals and Appeals, all take place somewhere in this large (formerly Sears) facility.  \n\nParking is difficult despite all the government buildings in the area, and the lines for accomplishing anything seem to stand still for hours at a time.  Still, the employees do their best to address your problems, and there is seldom an outburst of frustration.  \n\nYesterday, I represented someone who was to have his license suspended for two years due to some bad decisions several years ago. We appealed, and had a short hearing with a hearing officer to explain why this punishment would be an extreme hardship for him and his family.  We were successful in reducing the suspension to 6 months.  Still difficult, but much more manageable.  \n\nWe all left satisfied.  I can't claim that is the result for everyone else who must venture into this giant labyrinth to deal with the autonomy of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, but the faces on those emerging from its dark doors attest that survival is assured.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"We have returned twice thus far in 2016. Service was exceptionally slow both times.  \n\nDuring the first visit of 2016, the waitress apologized to our table for being slow because they had had their company party the night before and they were busy sharing pictures with each other.  This was during regular lunch hours and the place was only 10% full, if that.  There were four of us, we all ordered different items, but none of them were particularly exceptional save for the Yellowfin Tuna Cones.  Those were very tasty, but very tiny.\n\nOn the second return trip a few weeks later, we got the tuna cones again so my husband could try them.  We had the soup of the day, which was a gumbo over mashed potatoes.  It was tasty and I'd order it again, but it seemed like a comfort food you'd find in the Midwest.  Again, the service was exceptionally slow and the restaurant was not particularly crowded.\n\nAll in all, I feel like the food isn't as memorable as it once was, but it is decent.  The service, however, really needs to pick it up.  This is not the type of place to go if you are are looking to spend less than an hour+ on lunch.","stars":3.0}

I don't advise the wings though, they were charred and on a glass grill and they smelled and tasted like propane.  The wing sauces were great though so order that on the side with a burger and be amazed!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Wanted to try the chix and waffles, but they were all out-- plus the waitress didn't tell me until she took my order, so I didn't have a chance to think up a different choice :(  Got eggs instead, but couldn't switch out the potatoes.  Coffee was good, but the whole thing was a bit underwhelming.  Planning on trying again, but getting something else-- I can get more interesting eggs elsewhere, cheaper.  I'd change my review if I have a better experience.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Stop reading this right now and go there.  This place is WONDERFUL and it would be hard to say enough glowing comments regarding the staff,  food, and outdoor garden setting.  Ask for Christian- he was the embodiment of a professional server.  And I'm regretting not getting the sorcery bartender's name last night.   Clearly this gentleman has a special kind of magic because the house aperitif he recommended has me feeling fantastic today after a late night of eating, drinking, and laughing way too much.  Go here and don't leave without trying their chef specials (the pork chop will revisit me in dreams), their charcuterie board, and the tiramisu that just reset the bar for my favorite dessert.  I promise you will not regret going here (and if you do you're probably one of those people that should never leave your house anyway)","stars":5.0}

I wanted to let people in on a great deal, their happy hour includes food some food items from their appetizer menu-meatballs, fritto misto, and all the flatbreads.

{"text":"Will not be returning to the Union after receiving very poor service last night. A drink had spilt on the bar counter top and when I asked one of the bartenders if she could wipe it up she responded very snappy. Once cleaned off, she said 'did you survive?' I was in shock that an employee would talk to a customer like that! I asked for the manager and he shrugged off anything I had to say. To top it all off, an employee ended up sending me a harassing message over social media!! Extremely unprofessional and so creepy!!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Kudos to my husband for finding this gem of a cafe, via Yelp, in a mall just after you turn onto Bearss from Bruce B. Downs. Everything is made to order. They have a nice choice of of meat and veggie combo sandwiches, panini, and wraps. With so many wounderful, healthy choices it was hard to choose. I went for Chipolte Turkey Breast with spicy organic greens, bacon and a choice of a sauce. I chose to have it in a wrap. All of the flavors blended together like a symphony. My husband started with Potato Leek soup. Yes, it was good. How do I know? I Tasted it, that's how. Sorry I got lost in my wrap so I don't recall what he had. Dessert, Mmmmmmm!! Season Fresh has home made Gelado. I had the Chocolate Orange, and my husband had a delicious creamed filled Italian pastry. The cafe also has an Espresso Bar, I had a very good Iced Cappucino. Fresh Squeezed Juices, and Smoothies are also items that might interest you. It's not a big cafe but there is an outdoor area that seems to be shaded. To my husband, good find honey!","stars":4.0}
