The grilled octopus was perfect-- tender and not rubbery at all. The tuna tartare was also out of this world. The pan-seared filet of sole was so fresh, sauteed in an olive oil sauce that tasted buttery but contained no butter. Get the yogurt cheesecake!

But when the food actually comes out, it will seem like $20 dishes. So it's worth it! The reason for the one star missing was that this place really didn't stand out to us.

{"text":"Terrible management company. It takes several emails and calls to get any issue resolved, and they might not even be able to solve it. They never return calls when they tell you they will call you back and when you finally get a hold of them, your call will be transferred around until somebody actually knows the information (sometimes it means that you need to call the owner of the building, which will tell you to call back HOW Properties). Maintenance people knock twice and if you don't answer immediately, they come in and start working, whether you are there or not. They once came in when I was in the shower. We had several stolen packages in Blockley II and the management's response to complaints was that we should file a police report, since they didn't have the technology to playback the security cameras. A few weeks after that, they sent us an email saying that they would playback the cameras to see who failed to pick up after their dog in the garden. Lastly, there are unexpected deductions in your security deposit. The apartments are nice and cheap, but the management company does not care about the people living there. Don't do it.","stars":1.0}

The cardio was fine but it was definitely something that I could do on my own so it didn't seem like it was worth the money. Also they use heart rate monitors but about 15 minutes into the workout, an employee told me that the one they provided for me wasn't working so they had to change it out. A segment of my workout wasn't recorded which was disappointing. The class wasn't horrible but it was overpriced and not quite as effective as I had hoped.","stars":2.0}

It actually arrived about a half hour earlier than their estimate. When I opened the box, I found that they only put sauce and cheese on about half of the pizza. I called back to complain and was told the manager couldn't come to the phone because they were busy and to just give me 50% off my next order. I told the cashier I wanted a replacement or to give me a refund and they could come pick up this nasty pie. She said they would make me a replacement pie and deliver it, but it would take about an hour and a half, since they're busy.

{"text":"My husband and I had the privilege of eating here the other night and it has become a new favorite. We were wary of the communal table aspect but since we didn't have the foresight to rustle up two good friends so we could get a table to ourselves, we were resigned to the group table option. But we needn't have worried. We didn't really interact too much with the people next to us but they were cool and we all checked out each other's food and it helped us decide what to order. We each had an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. I could list all the items but since the menu changes almost daily, it might be a case of getting you all excited for a dish that is no longer offered. Suffice to say that the poached egg on the scallop dish was sublime, the chocolate short ribs were the perfect size and richness, and the candied serranos on the flan were a revelation. No real missteps that I can catalog. The quinoa under the short ribs was a bit underseasoned but nothing a little extra salt couldn't fix. As a non-drinker, I'm always a little bummed by the \"mocktails\" but our server suggested something from the drink menu but without the alcohol and it translated just fine. Great atmosphere - as some have mentioned, it is small. But it is a restaurant in a converted house. So there is that... I think the design team did a great job of using the space they had. It felt plenty comfortable to us. The tables and chairs are repurposed wood from the house itself and they are works of art. Take notice. The hours are incredible for working musicians and other restaurant types - we've all been wanting a place like this! We are grateful for The Treehouse. It's a concept that works.

I just wanted to go upstairs to see what it looks like before there are a lot of people in there, I wanted to take some pictures. After asking, speaking with a few different people my request was not granted. I even told them I like to write reviews..It wasn't like they were really busy, although the manager was getting inspection by the health department. But there were plenty of other people that could've filled my request. I did go downstairs to the gift shop but didn't really see anything that I wanted to purchase.

Every week local musicians play the piano and the bar is flexible to accommodate local friends and family and treats them like true guests of honor.

Certain times in the past, it has happened where I was just \"tasting a bite\" of his food and ended up just eating it and not giving it back... this taco might have suffered the same fate if Kevin had not already told me I couldn't keep it after my *one* bite.

Also, the employees seemed friendly and the one who took our order and rang us up was knowledgeable about which tortillas would be good with which meat fillings (and recommended combinations for my husband). I'd like to come back sometime to try their breakfast items. The chorizo and egg taco is calling my name! If you get a craving for Mexican food in South City, check out Taco Circus!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I stopped by B & A for a sweet treat. I was really in the mood for a chocolate chip cookie, but unfortunately, they only had peanut butter. They also had lots of Christmas sugar cookies and ginger bread men, but I felt like it was a bit soon to be indulging in holiday treats just yet. Then I saw that they had \"wagon wheels.\" They were only 90 cents each and looked really good and chocolately, so I decided to get a couple of those. They ended up being very delicious. It was a bit different than the Wagon Wheels that you find in the store. Sandwiched between two shortbread cookies was a cream filling, and inside that cream filling was strawberry jam. The whole thing was covered in chocolate and topped with a small cream flower. It was really good. This bakery also sells a variety of cakes, breads, and pastries. Everything is reasonably priced, much cheaper than some bakeries I've been to. Take note that B & A only takes cash, so be sure to check your wallet or hit the bank machine, before your show up!","stars":4.0}

I thought hey the bathrooms must be down or something but, my wife's mother went to the bathroom and said they smelled clean. So I don't know there must have been a random turd hidden somewhere in the restaurant. They also must have had the heat up because it was ungodly hot we were all sweating. The server was overwhelmed because they were understaffed so she was yelling accross the room at customers to take orders. I ordered the chicken parmesan which I could have made at home with a 1 dollar box of spaghetti and some frozen breaded chicken patties because that's what it actually was. It was hard to eat because everything smelt like complete actual human excrement. Horrible experience will never return to this olive garden.

I think it was the whole we don't need your business, cash only in 2015 attitude that kinda pissed me off about this place.

If your customers annoy you maybe you should do something else, and get rid off the skater haircut, you're in your 40s, you douche. The cash only thing really bothers me, it's 2015, if the 2-4% you pay per transaction really bothers you, you should pay closer attention to the front door and watch the people you turn away with that mentality.

I don't recommend buying here if you're not 100% sure about something though. I got a belt that I was semi happy with and the workers convinced me to get it. One I got home I realized this was not a good fit so I called to see if I could return it (I live in MD btw). The employee was helpful over the phone by stating the store policy but had a mocking and sarcastic tone. Since they don't refund, they only do store credits which I understand for clients that are from the area but not someone who is two states away.

The hotel and location was very quiet. Maid service came on time every day, and the staff was very polite and helpful. This hotel definitely deserves 5 stars for the price we paid. We are so glad we found this hotel. All the surrounding decent hotels were $100+ each night and offered the same level of quality, if not less.

Had my table of over 10 all smell\/taste it and they all agreed it didn't smell or taste right. Called Manager Josh over to smell it but he says he can't smell anything which could be protocol to not agree with us if the food is bad. I asked him to take the meat and go get it tested for quality and possible bad batch of meat. I told him if it's in a batch, that batch may be bad because meat doesn't and isn't suppose to smell like that. I feel bad for his establishment and the mishap he could not control due to bad meat US Foods may have provided him. He provided wonderful service, took my salad off the bill and comped me a dessert but I've lost my appetite and could not enjoy it. I don't expect the meat here to taste like Berns or Council Oaks by any means but I don't think it should smell like dirty socks\/sewage\/old bad meat.

{"text":"Solid burger joint, but try to go during off peak hours. Our wait was about 30 mins at lunchtime on a Friday. The ups: juicy, juicy burger cooked to perfection (had the LA), decent sweet potato fries (your standard, nothing too original, decent portions), and a damn good strawberry shake. Service was also very good, although I'd be curious to see how long it lasts. The downs: just the wait, really. And the price - $7.50 for a burger with nothing else, no options for add on's either. In this country, I think burgers should come with fries, and you should have the right to vote and to add bacon or grilled onions to everything. Next time, I will try one of the spiked shakes...those look yummy.","stars":4.0}

Brightly colored pastel walls with retro images of the 1950s. I was with three other people on a Sunday morning and was seated in about ten minutes. I ordered the apple jacks omelette for my main and the pancake fries to start with the friends I was with. The food was good and different but by no means anything to rave home about. I felt the selection of entries were many. Maybe even too many. I would recommend cutting down on the food choices and focusing on quality. Most of the dishes that came out were a bit sloppy but I don't think the customer coming into this restaurant is really looking for that. Overall I had a good time at this restaurant for my first time. Waitress was very lively and jovial almost too much at times but I think this place is more for memories than for the food.

{"text":"Senae Thai is a modern and attractive spot with beautiful dishes that fall short when you eat them. I had the gaeng pak (green curry) with tofu. The curry seemed lacking in veggies - only had eggplant, zucchini, and a couple small bites of celery. Far more sauce than veggies. On top of that, the veggies seemed hardly cooked. They were still pretty crunchy. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but I didn't love it. I also didn't love the heavy-handed drizzle of olive oil all over the top. This didn't feel like a classic curry. The flavor was okay, but the texture of the veggies was a letdown. The others in my group tried the drunken noodles and the chicken satay. They weren't overly impressed. The restaurant seemed understaffed, so I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and propose that perhaps this isn't their normal food quality. That being said, I would probably seek out a different Thai restaurant before coming back.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I see a lot of 4 and 5 star reviews so maybe we caught this place at a bad time, but the only reason I give it even 2 stars is our waitperson Kelly was so friendly! I requested a simple grilled salmon meal with roasted veg and artichoke quinoa. First off, the salmon was over-cooked to complete dryness. \"Roasted\" veg ended up being zucchini boiled or steamed within an inch of its life and there was very little artichoke or flavor in the quinoa. Additionally, the meal was plated in a long rectangular plate with mushy veg on 1 side and slab of dry salmon on the other... with nothing in between. A full 1\/3D of the plate was empty and quite unappealing. Finally, while the belly dancer was fun and the waitstaff dance was cute, I dont understand why they walk thru restaurant and throw a bundle of paper napkins up in the air. They land on the floor, making it slippery, the napkins stick to your shoes like TP, and not for nothing, but why do we need to bE creating all that unnecessary waste? Not very PC in my mind. Did we just hit it on an off night for the kitchen? I don't know. But we will likely not return to test that theory.","stars":2.0}

The stuff that looks like chopped up seafood on top of the cocktail is actually a horseradish concoction that will clean out your sinuses in an instant! With your meal you get either a cup of navy bean soup or a cup of tomato juice. Strange options but I guess it goes back to the original owner. The soup was very good! Everyone at my table had steak.... Not many other options here. Everyone was more than satisfied. One guy I was with (who is from NY) said it was the best steak he's ever had. The waiters were very knowledgeable of the menu and wine selections. Water glass was never empty. Overall, expensive place but you get all you pay for. Enjoyed it and would go back next time I'm in town.","stars":4.0}

Dr. Moffett seemed completely careless\/heartless. The receptionists were also not very friendly. I did not feel welcome, nor did I feel at all comfortable. The day of my surgery was even worse! During my surgery, a different assistant than the one during my consultation was working with Moffett- and prior to my surgery she realized how nervous I was, and she'd said that had she'd known she would have prescribed something to help me be calm for the surgery- She was the one person that was actually comforting\/friendly.

{"text":"The French Market is an open air marketplace that's open for business daily. It actually spans the length of six blocks and technically begins at Caf\u00e9 du Monde, who is one of the marketplace tenants. And spread across the market's numerous tables and stands, you can find everything from souvenirs to clothing to food and drinks. Often you can hear music as well, as the market makes for a great performance space. While it's mostly a shopping center, this spot is surprisingly historic. The market is the oldest of its kind in the United States - apparently it once housed a Native American trading post. It's evolved in the centuries since to meet the needs of its residents, eventually becoming the massive market that it is today. If you're visiting New Orleans, it's worth taking one stroll through this market. It's definitely designed for tourists (so don't buy everything in sight - you may find a cheaper item elsewhere!), but it's a beautiful sight at least. And if nothing else, a vendor or cafe may provide you with the perfect treat to make your tastebuds happy.","stars":4.0}

For the owner of all people to treat customers like that is disgusting. Theres a reason this dump had two stars before I even left my review.

Actually, I'd prefer this place to casual dining spots like Applebee's, etc. any day. They have a really interesting menu with everything from healthy (but not boring-sounding) salads to seafood dishes to indulgent soups like creamy wild mushroom, which was delicious! They also have an enomatic wine dispenser (like a self-serve soda fountain, but obviously better!) You can choose a sample pour for just a taste, or a 4- or 6-oz. pour if you want more. Friendly, personable staff & service as good as any upscale restaurant. (No curt, grumpy fast food workers here.) It was a great location for our networking group today, and there are others working here on laptops, too. Can't find anything negative to say about this place at all!

{"text":"Last week on May 14, 2016 I threw my best friend a baby shower. Foolishly, I only counted backwards 6 weeks from her due date, and after invitations were sent out and I began the quest to reserve some beatiful stems did I realize that Mother's Day was the weekend before her baby shower. While calling around to local florists to find out if they were open for wholesale to the public, I was continually told to wait until AFTER Mother's Day because Hydrangea stems were at a premium. The day after Mother's Day, I dutifully followed up on the advice of the florists, but I was quickly informed that all but 2 florists were cleaned out of Hydrangea COMPLETELY. The florist that was closest to my home, as I live in St. Pete, quoted me at 40 stems for $3.95 per stem. I thought to myself, I can do better. I finally called into Bloomindays and spoke with Bianca. She was very friendly, and assured me that they had plenty of stems to supply me with. She gave me a quote of $2.00 per stem, and said they would definitely be ready for pickup on Friday. When I arrived at Bloomindays Flower Shop I was greeted warmly by Michael and his wonderful staff. He hadn't received his shipment that day yet, and wanted to make sure that the stems I received were top quality. I had other errands to do so it was no big deal for me to go tootle around and get them done for an hour or so. When I came back he had the stems wrapped in brown wrap ready to go and even threw in a few blue stems for a few pops of color for me. The Hydrangeas were beautiful, full, and had no brown edges anywhere in the bunch (I ordered 60 stems and was very glad I got more!). The entire experience from start to finish was incredibly easy and friendly, and if I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't change a thing! I am so happy I found these guys, and will definitely call them FIRST for the next event I decide to host that need flowers! Truly a top notch experience! Thank you Bloomingdays!","stars":5.0}

For dine-in the servers really have no experience in serving.. you may get one meal before your friends do. I ordered a slice and some garlic knots while the rest of my party ordered 2 sandwiches. The waitress brought my slice and garlic knots together, then brought the other orders about 10 minutes later... She also asked if we wanted refills on our EMPTY glasses when she brought the slice, we didn't get our drinks until we were done eating our food. The place had a total of 5 patrons ( 3 at our table ). At the time they had 2 waitresses working, 1 lady working the cash register and 3 or 4 cooks. My other complaint is when ordering over the phone for pickup. I have ordered at all times, late\/early, lunch\/dinner and have given them plenty of time to finish the order 20-30 mins before I show up and still end up waiting 20 minutes for my order. I have even tried paying by CC with hopes they would make the order before I showed up... Someone needs to teach them some urgency and they would get 4-5 stars.

Even though it was hot than a mutha, I chose to sit outside because of an obnoxious crying little kid inside. Thankfully, there was a breeze and a shaded seating area. I could have sat there for hours eating crepes and sipping ice teas. The waitress was really nice. I guess the only drawback is that this place can be quite pricey.

Two full size sandwiches, fries and 2 drinks - $28. Really!?! But if it had been better meat, I would have not minded the price. Roast Beef was the same way - a bit too done for my liking. I like my roast beef medium or medium rare. I had to salt it.. Goodness!! its a Deli.. it should be salty enough! The pickles were tasty., I loved them.

We called on Tuesday and were told by Andrea that she was waiting to hear from the factory and would call us by the end of the day. Still no call back. Thursday, my husband went to their store to ask what the problem was. Nick, the owner promised us the shower door would be installed this morning at 8:30am. At 9:45am, Andrea called and said the installer was \"running behind and would be leaving the shop in 15 minutes\". He finally showed up at 11:15 and told us that the shower door glass was never delivered. He had brought a piece of plexiglass to put in place of the glass. He told us that this is why he was late, he had to cut this to fit before he came. We called and spoke with Nick. We asked why we were not told about the glass not being there, where our cabinet doors were and why we cannot get responses from his company. Nick gave us 3 different stories about why the glass didn't show up. He promised to try to get the glass from the supplier today. After many calls, Nick called at 2pm to say that he was getting the glass from his supplier and would have the installer come back and put it in. He said that the cabinet doors got broken and he redid them and the installer would bring them when he came back. The installer finished up as far as he could go and then left to go get the glass. About 3 hours later, a different man showed up. He had the door glass. (Still no cabinet doors). Andrea called saying that the doors had \"not been ready\" when the installer left, so she would deliver them if we wanted them. We said yes.

After the brother's death, the dog became the sister's new family member and we decided the old boy dog (now age 14) needed a treat to a nice grooming, some good food and treats, and trip to the veterinarian. All the above was taken care of nicely! And since 'Show Dog Grooming' was within walking distance, we thought we'd give a neighborhood shop a try rather than a cooperate groomer like a Pet Smart, etc... What a lovely surprise! Two and a half hours later, after we went there and the owner and groomer made friends with 'Buddy'... we went to pick him up and he was beautiful - head to toe - to include a lovely new bandanna for him to wear with pride.

Strike One: I asked the guy if I could get 3 regular polish paint on my finger, and he said that would be an additional charge, which I couldn't see how because it was still a solid color in my nails, nothing extra. Do they have to charge for everything? Strike Two: While we were getting our pedicures done, the guy that I had went through the session extremely fast, and didn't do half of the things that my grandmother was getting done to her feet. He tried to play it off. I was done before the lady, who was also getting a pedi, who was at least 10 minutes before me who was also getting the deluxe package. Strike Three: I showed him a picture of how thin I want my nails. He kept saying \"square round\" and I said no. He showed me my pinky which looked how I wanted. Then he proceeded to do them. After the look I was not at all satisfied. He didn't even cut my real nail down whatsoever. They looked fat and bulky and not worth the money. Less than a week later, the paint is even peeling on 6 of the nails without me doing any dishwashing, etc. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED, will not be coming back. They are overpriced and not even that good.

The property is literally falling apart at the seams. NO REPUTABLE BUSINESS CHANGES PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANIES EVERY YEAR. NO REPUTABLE BUSINESS LEAVES THEIR TENANTS IN SUB-HABITABLE CONDITIONS FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. If you move in here, you'll be \"on your own\". The property is a disaster (Lakeridge East and Lakeridge West). It's owned by a shell company for TruAmerica ( - a big real estate investment group that gives zero craps about it's customers, and farms out it's property management to the cheapest\/worst third party property management companies possible. In five years, they've changed to a new property management company nearly every single year. Every year there's new people in the office who fail to get the job done. Every time they're as awful at getting stuff done as the last group. * The office phones are always busy\/ignored - especially if you're a resident. Good luck getting through without calling 10 times. * If you do connect, they'll make routine excuses about why they haven't answered, why they forgot about your conversation yesterday, and why nothing has happened since you called them last. * Maintenance requests will get ignored unless you call every day repeatedly. * If something urgent needs fixed, it'll take them 3-5 days to get there (after calling 20 times), and another week to get fixed. * If something major needs fixed, it's probably not going to get fixed unless you sue. They will make every effort to NOT fix things. They don't want to spend time\/money unless they're legally obligated. * If they promised you some benefit\/perk when you signed up, it's probably going to disappear or never happen.

{"text":"My wife and I let our membership to another wholesale store lapse last April in part due to our move to Lutz and in part due to the upcoming opening of a Costco right down the street from us. While it took a lot longer than we anticipated (the opening was pushed back from summer to fall to early 2017) it was well worth the wait. Like most wholesale stores, everything is bigger at Costco. They offer bread, torta rolls (which are surprisingly good) cheese, frozen goods, snacks, vitamins, laundry detergent, trash bags, seltzer water, Gatorade, candy, condiments, canned goods and protein bars in bulk. Costco always seem to be sampling stuff. At different times I've witnessed them sampling veggie burgers, coffee, pizza bites, trail mixes, popcorn, Snapea Crisps and hummus. My wife discovered an amazing cheese (her words, not mine) because it was being sampled one time we came through. Costco has many of the brand's that you've grown to love, just in a much bigger size. My family loves Morningstar Farms, Zephyrhills Seltzer Water, Snapea Crisps and Oreos and Costco offers wholesale sizes of each of these. Even better is that Costco has their own brand, Kirkland's, at rock bottom prices. We've purchased a few Kirkland items, namely the soy milk, fruit and nut bars, trash bags and stir fry vegetables. One thing I can whole-heartedly say is that the low prices of the Kirkland brand does not equate to low quality. The taste and the nutritional value is comparable to the big brands (although the Kirkland trash bags do taste a bit gummier than Glad). Just like a certain giant furniture store in Ybor, Costco offers hot food that patrons can purchase to eat. I have never been through the check out lines and not noticed at least four families sitting on the benches enjoying a \"Costco picnic.\" Based on the huge price boards above the ordering windows, Costco's hot food is downright cheap. I hate to even use the word cheap because there's cheap and then there's what Costco is pricing their hot food at. I can't vouch for the taste, not much in the way of vegan options, but seriously, you're paying like two dollars. Who cares if it is terrible? Like most wholesale clubs, you have to be a member to enjoy the Costco benefits. The fee is nominal compared to the savings you can reap over a year's time. My family is on the most basic plan (cost of 55 dollars for a year) but they also have a slightly pricier membership level that gives you perks (money back and a credit card). Costco also has a business level membership. No matter what your situation is, you'll find a membership level that works for you.","stars":4.0}

My husband ordered a potsticker sampler as an appetizer. He loves potstickers so he was really looking forward to them and they did not disappoint. I got the chicken lettuce wraps as an appetizer and they were delicious. I'd actually even order those again as a meal. They'd make a great lunch! They also bring buns to the table. They were hot and fresh! They almost had a donut like flavor to them. The butter seemed flavored as well and I didn't particularly care for that but it wasn't terrible. My husband ordered Pad Thai as his entree. He'd never had it before so he was unsure of his decision and the waitress assured him that it would be great. He absolutely loved it! Even once he was full he kept eating because it was so good! I ordered the garlic chicken after I checked to do it non spicy and they said that wasn't a problem. The portion was generous. The sauce was flavorful but not as garlicky as I would have expected. The veggies in it were very good and the rice made a good way to soak up more of the delicious sauce. The chicken was the only downside. It was overcooked and dry. It wasn't inedible but it wasn't great. The rest of the dish was enjoyable though. We mentioned that it was my husband's birthday and the waitress asked his name. After our meal she brought out a lava cake for him with a candle and his name on the plate.

It was important to us that we have our wedding at a place that was \"New Orleansy\" since most of our guests were from out of town. I didn't want to do it at a place that could have been in any other city. The gorgeous climate-controlled courtyard (w\/retractable canopy in case of rain!) was the perfect spot for our ceremony. Our florist decorated the fountain beautifully with candles and when we departed for our post-ceremony second line, they flipped the courtyard so it was now the perfect space for our cocktail hour. The reception room itself (La Louisiane) was set up beautifully, and the bar area is the most gorgeous part of the room with the exposed brick and gas lamps. There is no mistake that when you are at Hotel Mazarin, you are in New Orleans! The food was wonderful and the space was perfect for our six piece band. We had 110 guests and provided open seating for about 90 which I thought was perfect. Plenty of dance floor space! We also had a personal attendant. That was a nice touch that every bride and groom should have. We had a perfect day at the perfect hotel!!","stars":5.0}

Butterbeer (not actually beer) but is supposed to mimic Harry Potter's Butterbeer - it wasn't too bad actually - not too much butter - but after drinking it awhile, the butter gets to be a bit too much.

Lauren cuts several women friends, some with very wild curly hair, some with exceedingly fine hair and they wouldn't go anywhere else. Her husband, Michael cuts my hair and my husband's and other friends and to say the cuts are good would be a deafening understatement. Never have I had anything less than a great haircut that was actually fun to \"mess with\" and, it changes over time, not that he doesn't take handwritten notes of your current cut for the file.

{"text":"I have liked Ronnie's in the past but haven't been here in a long time. I came on a weekday around lunch time and was a little late seeing my movie. I tried to buy tickets at the kiosk and it let me select the movie but kept saying there were no seats left. I went to the line and the employee told me it just says that after the show starts. But if I didn't ask I would have assumed it sold out and left costing them my ticket price. I was starving and went to their diner counter to place a food order. There was a sign that said ring bell to order which I did and waited (when I was already late for my movie) and no one came. There was no sign anywhere with their hours to make sure people don't waste their time. I went to the concessions counter after and there were no options that were appropriate for lunch. Once I got to my movie my seat was comfortable and I had a nice time. With other competing theaters in town (I usually go to AMC Esquire) I find it hard to justify coming here with the lack of food options and confusing kiosk","stars":2.0}

I saw a lot of velvet upstairs, including a pretty red velvet dress from Bergdorfs. I even saw some fur coats. The real winner of the search was a dress I did not even buy, a Thierry Mugler dress for an insanely affordable price. Mugler has not designed anything in 15 years and is still being worn by many celebs. I have always loved his work and to see such a gorgeous dress of his was a treat. My sister bought a pair of pants that fit perfectly that she became obsessed with and the staff working at the time was very kind. Please someone go buy this dress.

{"text":"Today my wife and I wanted something different for brunch and decided to go to ABC to get their Sunday special (baked lasagna). However, when we got there, we were surprised to see a lunch buffet setup in the middle of the restaurant. The buffet was loaded with a lot of really tasty looking things (slices of pizza, some baked chicken with potatoes, a big salad bar, etc). We took one look and immediately changed our minds. I don't usually like buffets, but this one looked really fresh and everything was clean and well maintained. We each had a side salad and I was happy to see that ABC's potato salad (which is the best thing ever) was on the buffet. I made my salad, got a scope of the potato salad, and chowed down. After the salad, I went back for some pizza, a piece of the baked chicken, and a couple of pieces of the baked potato. The flavor of the baked potato and chicken were amazing. The chicken was so tender, and I wish I knew how to cook it like that at home. The pizza was phenomenal as well. I always forget that ABC is a pizza place first and foremost. Even though I've been eating at ABC for most of my life, I rarely have their pizza and I always forget how good it is. Their crust is really good, and not at all greasy. I had a slice of the feta\/mozzarella\/spinach pizza and a slice of the Hawaiian pizza. Both were incredible and I wish I had passed on the salad so I could have a couple more slices of each. After we finished eating, we walked out the door paying less than $10 a person (with a drink). The food quality was great, the service was quick, and it was a perfect Sunday afternoon brunch.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Our family has been going to Tutti Frutti for several years, and one of the best features was their gluten free options. However, recently they started up-charging for each gluten free item in the order... I paid an extra $5.85 for a meal couple weeks ago for a \"gluten free Sausage, crepe and toast\" on a menu item. Yesterday, I was charged an extra $3.90 for gluten free toast and waffle. At most establishments, you'd pay a single premium for a gluten free plate, but they have implemented this predatory pricing for those of us with dietary restrictions. For those of us with a Gluten sensitivity, we are well aware of the premium we pay not to have unnecessary wheat products added to meat or other products, and to be charged the price of a whole loaf of gluten free bread (and a low quality product at that), I have no sympathy for the owners. I am very disappointed at this predatory pricing model and will not be recommending this restaurant for anyone with food sensitivities or allergies.","stars":1.0}

I wonder if I paid for a rotation and check and nothing was done and they pencil whipped my service sheet. It makes me wonder what else the pencil whip in the service dept. This is the second time I have had an experience there where nothing was done. The last time I had brought my car in for scheduled service I alway look at the service checklist. It said both tires were good with good tread. About 2 days later I had the garage door open and happened to look at my tires and the tread seemed bad. I went in and got a penny and checked them out and the tread didn't even reach the top of Lincoln's head. I went to a tire place the next day and had to have all 4 tires replaced.

{"text":"Starting off, I've been coming here on a semi regular basis; about two times a month for the past two years. They may not know my name but they recognize me. Up until now my only complaint would be sometimes they are slow. But here are two things that made me stop going here Forever. A few weeks ago I came in there were three nail techs, and I was the only one waiting for a mani pedi. I sat patiently for about 35 mins since they were all occupied.nat about 40 mins, another woman walks in, and gets taken immediately because she had an appointment. That's not a problem If a: they gave me an estimated wait time or B: told me that there was an appointment coming in soon! They literally let me sign in, sit down, said NOTHING to me for 40 mins other than \"she had an appointment\". So I just left. The last straw is today. I went in to have my tips removed, that I had gotten done there 3 weeks ago. The previous time i Got tips removed here, itwas fast and I got a manicure. Today they wanted to soak it off. Which I hate because it takes forever, dries my skin and weakens the nail. The nail tech half heartedly tries to remove Acrylic nails with A PLASTIC TIP!!!! Shes taking her sweet time, removes 3 nails, then decides I MUST soak it off, because they are fresh. They are absolutely not fresh. I got these done before my wedding over 3 weeks ago. Anyways halfway through the soaking and her looking at her phone and I pad, I ask if she can just do a top coat, because it's taking too long, When I go up to pay, they tried to tell me it was 15!!!!!! I didn't even get a manicure, the nails were never fully removed, and I got one effing coat! In their own menu it says 5$ for removal! I explain this, and get told WITH attitude, that it's only 5 if you get a new set. Which by the way makes absolutely no sense, why someone would pay 5 dollars, spend an extra 40 mins, just to start the whole process over!! Finally I paid 10, which I think it still over charging. This is not the first time, because I also got over charged for having two nail designs on a gel manicure. I was already paying for the gel manicure, but he design apparently costs more.....since its gel.....which I'm already paying for...so they charged me 50 dollars for two measly designs on a 30 dollar service.","stars":1.0}

My fave was the one with bacon. Then we shared the pumpkin french toast and the red velvet waffles. Pumpkin french toast was amazing. You could taste pumpkin flavors and spices in the bread. It wasn't a huge serving at first glance, but plenty to keep you full. The red velvet waffles, in contrast, were a really huge serving. The cream cheese creme or whatever it was on top was so rich and delightful. The waffles themselves were pretty ordinary in taste, despite being that deep red color.

I came with my family for dinner when it wasn't too busy yet. We were seated right away and they came by with the chips and salsa as soon as we were seated. Our server (I wish I remembered their name) brought us our drinks right away and when it came time to order, memorized the whole thing without writing it down.

My coworker, a native of New Orleans, had told me about this place, saying you could barely see your hand in front of your face. He was right - I loved the candlelight-only motif.

Being from Texas, maybe not used to fries being so salted, but the two dipping sauces served with the fries added good flavor.

I ordered the spicy cucumber appetizer and the spicy beef noodle spice with a specification of slightly spicy. The food, especially the cucumber s tasted great. Nothing was super spicy. The food was flavorful. I had some reservations about the soup. It was a bit too salty, the noodles were overcooked a bit, not enough beef, and I found a tiny hair in it. I didn't let the hair bother me . To me I just thought that maybe the cook wasnt wearing a hair net. I would come back but not for the soup. Perhaps the owner should go to the nearby restaurant and SpiceC and try their beef soup in order to see how to better prepare and portion the soup. Also, tea kettles instead of a full cup of tea might be a good investment since my tea got cokd really quickly. But all in all, thank you for the hospitality and comfort food","stars":3.0}

Maybe when you pick it up they will be using PPE in the form of a gigantic inflatable T-Rex suit and put a smile on your face, but if you are not that lucky, you will still have something comforting and delicious to take you through this time. My recommendations are the beef rendang and the collards but everything is delicious and they have lot of of vegetarian and vegan friendly dishes like egg curry, tempeh, and jackfruit curry and great meat things like sate and goat curry. Don't forget the sambal hot sauce! Over the years I've come here for many dinners with friends (you can bring wine and there's not a ton of seating so you may have to wait), a birthday dinner for my sister (parent approved), and gotten takeout for someone who requested it as their last meal before leaving Philly (and the first thing she requested when she came back to visit). It's no frills and people don't like too long, even when drinking wine out of plastic cups. You stand in line to order kind of like a cafeteria, but it feels homey and cozy, unlike a cafeteria. The owners are lovely and they need your support during this time!

My favorite is the fish tofu, but the fish balls, corn sausage, wings, shrimp, etc are totally solid. Secondly: hot pot. Great soup, featuring a solid and well balanced broth. The diner choses the proteins and veggies to accompany the noodles and broth from a long and exciting list of ingredients. Everything is warm with a great texture and fresh flavor. I would safely call this the best noodle soup in the city. The 'very spicy' level is no joke. It's invigorating. Third: the joint. 2 narrow counters and 8 stools, the guy that cooks and the lady that runs the counter. Simple, clean, outstanding. Prices are great, always lots of takeout.

When I got there the chalkboard had \"today's special\" written on it, which was a chicken parm sandwich and fries for 8 dollars. When I ordered the special, we were told that it was a \"lunch special\" and she was supposed to erase it (we got there at 4 o'clock) and the sign didn't indicate that it was a lunch special. Instead I decided to order a tuna hoagie, which was one of the worst tuna hoagies I have ever eaten in my life (trust me, I've eaten a lot of them). After I told the workers that I didn't want it, I ordered a slice of pizza and was charged for both the sandwich and pizza.. I have never given back food before but I had to with this sandwich, and we were not given anything in return. My sister bread on her sandwich was soggy. On a side note, a side order of French fries is 8 dollars. For just a side. The only redeeming quality of our experience was the bruschetta. I literally made a yelp account just to write this review.

Scallops were a perfect cook and spiced with a deft hand. Heirloom tomato dish hit the spot as well. Service was just ok. Our meal took less than an hour for 3 people as we were in a hurry and bill was $150 with five glasses of wine. Tip was $30 which seemed way too much for a server that seemed as engaged as a server at a fast casual restaurant. In fairness, we were there early -right when they opened since we had a concert to go to - and the tables around us with younger patrons seemed more of interested to the server as they filtered in around 6.

{"text":"This Mod Pizza is in the same shopping center where Trader Joe's is located, in Marlton, so I decided to pick up a pizza for dinner, after getting some groceries. What I liked: 1) Easy ordering process (a line just like at a Subway or Chipotle). 2) The price is affordable. 3) You have the freedom to add whatever you like to your pizza, at no extra per topping cost. It's all included. So, you can make a very healthy pizza, with meats and veggies, if you like. 4) Fast -- the pizza is baked within 3 minutes or so, and it's ready. 5) The lemonade tasted pretty good too. What I didn't like: 1) If you choose to order online, there is no pay at the store option. So, you have to prepay with a credit card. 2) Some customers ahead of you can really slow down the line, because they are not sure what toppings they want, and they just take too much time deciding. That happened to me. It's not the restaurant's fault, of course. 3) The crust -- so, the crust comes in two sizes, and a mega option. But, the mega is just a thicker crust in the same standard size (about 10 inches), just that they stack two pre-made crusts on top of each other. The crust is thin, which is why it gets baked so quickly, so it does not taste like a regular local pizzeria crust, if that's what you're used to. Overall, I liked this restaurant, and will be returning whenever I'm in the area.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Not worthy.... I apologize to those who eat here regularly and leave 5 star reviews, but IMHO you may have little real knowledge about constitutes good BBQ. I ordered the full rack of Baby Back ribs and was presented with a charred remnant of what used to be a piece of pork. Did they fall off the bone? NO, they were too dry for that, in fact I believe that Lucky B's meat smoking process is tantamount to making pork jerky. The only difference being that jerky does not have a 1\/4 inch layer of blackened carbonized flesh on one side. My order came with two inedible sides of Mushy Mac & Cheese, and Baked beans that tasted somewhat spoiled or off somehow. With a single drink the tab for this meal was over $29.00 Not a good value, not good BBQ, and the service, well, lets not go there either. When the meal is delivered, diners are asked by the server if they are familiar with Lucky B's collection of sauces? When you say no, the waitress says, well, just put a dollop of each on your finger and you will know what they taste like! We only found one sauce with this method that was even close to being palatable, I dare say that it occurred to us that the sauce most likely formerly may have been known as Kraft's best vinegar based BBQ sauce before being re-packaged and thinned by Lucky B's staff of culinary wunderkind. If you are on 4th Street every day as I am, choose another stop for lunch or dinner, Lucky B's rates far down on the list of decent places to eat in this part of St Petersburg.","stars":1.0}

This is about an authentic and tasteful experience that just might leave you a little dazed at the end of the night. The food is amazing but I caution you to pace yourself. The chicken filo pastry covered in powdered sugar that comes with every meal is particularly hard to eat sparingly of. It's warm, delicious and filling so keep some room for the main courses and dessert. By the end of the meal you will feel quite satiated but you should not pass on the wonderful tea they offer you. It is the perfect end to an incredible experience.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The first time I stopped into iCandy I was with some friends, and we didn't stick around long because the place was crowded and they just weren't feeling it that night. However, I came back another night while waiting to meet up with a friend to see Rocky Horror at the Troc, and since everything was closing, I didn't want to linger around on the streets in fear of getting accosted by some freak. Therefore, I came into iCandy in search of a good cocktail. At the bartender's suggestion, I settled on a Pinnacle whipped cream vodka with cranberry juice--wasn't too strong and it hit the spot! Only $4, when it would've cost $8 elsewhere. Personally, the club portion is not my thing; I'd rather just stick to the bar...besides, the bartenders are very pretty and friendly, and a friend of mine is one of the \"shot boys!\"","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This is an absolute must-see for the locals and tourists alike. My fianc\u00e9 and I are down visiting the Tampa Bay Area, and are super interested in flora sites so decided to stop here. It was nothing short of a beautiful experience. They have a path that you can follow all around the venue! For some, it could be a ten minute walk, but us - we spent a good 1.5 hours admiring all the beautiful greenery and plant life...as well as animal life. Signs were posted up at almost every type of different genus species of plant and animal to allow customers to know what they are looking at. They did offer some bird attractions as well as a few fish and amphibian enclosures. Their flamingos are a must see! They have to have at least twenty flamingo in the one enclosure. We went around 12pm, and saw a lot of free-roaming squirrels and lizards amongst all the pathway greenery - some honeybees too but they don't bother you. The only thing, as an animal lover, that I didn't enjoy were the birds and other animals at Sunken Gardens were in rather small cages\/enclosures instead of being able to run\/fly free. Tickets run for $10 per adult at the venue, but you may also be able to find coupons on Groupon for it too. We snagged a coupon for $11 for two adults on Groupon. The gift shop has a lot of flamingo themed items, for obvious reasons, and a lot of other cute and intricately made items. From umbrellas, necklaces, salt & pepper shakers, cups\/mugs, souvenir shirts, and even Christmas decorations, they just about have it all. The restrooms are also located inside, along with the gift shop. The staff was also SUPER helpful and sweet. Parking was not horrible, and Sunken Gardens does share a parking lot with a restaurant, but considering that you have to walk the venue to sight-see, the walk from where you park to the entrance is not far at all. Overall, we had a wonderful time, saw some epically beautiful greens, AND saw flamingos for the first time. 10\/10 would recommend and go again next time we are down visiting.","stars":5.0}

No doubt pets sense he is their pal that wants to make them better. He takes the time to explain the pets maladies and answer questions, unlike some other vets I've been too. Some vets just want to do way too many procedures just to make more money, but not Dr. Diesel.... he explains the options and pros and cons. The place has the feel of a country doctor, homey and pet friendly. Staff is efficient and also like the pets we bring in. The prices are fair and decent. They also have a sweet, comforting little \"good by pet\" room when it's time for your pet to go to pet heaven...they let you spend some time and say your good byes with pet before the transition.... so much better than having your pet euthanized on a cold steel table.","stars":5.0}

His appointment calendar is extremely crowded, but I gave them a few days of the week I knew I would be free, and even though my appointment was more than a month in the future, they called me the next day and squeezed me in when someone canceled.

{"text":"Best vape shop in New Orleans, hands down. Gotta love the Magazine location! The original Crescent City Vape! I first hit up these guys a few months ago when I was ready to upgrade to a serious vape. I used vaping to quit smoking a while back and I started with the cheapo e-cigarettes from Walgreens. They weren't cutting it for me, and I definitely didn't wanna to go back to smoking. I live nearby here, so I tried them out--and boy I'm glad I did. The shop is shotgun-style, with a real Uptown Magazine Street boutique feel to it. When I go here I feel like I'm getting service from a Vape Concierge, no foolin. The customer service was incredible from the get-go. They treated me immediately like a friend. I was innocent, I was naive--but they gave me the Vaping 411. They talked me through how an e-cig works, what I would need to keep vaping, the right nicotine level for how much I used to smoke, all that. They even told me--which I didn't know before-- how serious battery safety is. They gave me all the tips to be careful. Curt helped me find an incredible setup that kicked serious clouds and had awesome flavor. I got an iStick Pico and a Herakles V2 tank. It was like a revelation. If you've ever gone from a cheap pen-style vape to a serious one like this, you know--it's a world, nay, a universe of difference. Even something like a Nautilus (I used to take puffs off of my friend's setup) doesn't compare to this level. That first time I also got what would become easily my favorite e-liquid to date, the Black Hole from Paradox Liquids. These guys are a local juice brand and they make truly unique flavors. The Uncertainty is the most popular from what I hear, but I'll always go back to the Black Hole. You gotta try this stuff. Toasted almond donut heaven. I don't need to eat dessert any more. I can vape it. I also wanted a stealthy, no-fuss setup as a backup, so I picked up a Joyetech Ego AIO. These are pen style vapes that actually pack a punch. Perfect if you're hitting up a show at Tipitina's and want something convenient to get that nicotine punch.","stars":5.0}

The stirfry was cold, as in \"still felt like it was in the refrigerator\" cold. The service is very inconsistent and I've had better experiences at other locations.

{"text":"I first eyed this French restaurant about 2 days ago and decided to dine there tonight. I made reservations and arrived about 10 minutes before. I was asked to wait and did so, no big problem. I ordered the salmon tar tar and it was great, amazing and out of this world. It had cucumbers, iced lettuce and watermelon radish. I ordered a white Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 as we were having seafood. A good choice, but the menu is heavy on reds. My daughter ordered the French onion soup and it was served in the brown\/beige bowl and not the white lion handle traditional French white bowl. Not a major difference like whether it is a Parisian vs Lyonnaise recipe. I opted for the mulles and frittes. First observation, it did not come in the de rigor metal pot but rather a soup bowl. I was more than 2\/3 through when I came across a semi raw mussel. Now mind you I have had this dish at least 2 dozen times from miami to Brussels to of course Paris. I had never had a semi raw mussel. My side fries were overly salted. However the homemade mayonnaise was spot on; I could taste the egg yolk and mustard. It was definitely home made. As for my wine cup it sat empty for awhile until the first refill. Thereafter it was filled regularly. Overall with a tab approaching 300 I was disappointed. Service: lackluster, improved as the night wore on. Parking: side parking. Food: average, hit or miss and the semi cooked mussel a culinary faux pas.","stars":3.0}

It wasn't especially clean, the selection wasn't all that, and the produce was minimal. I guess I had it pretty good with Tienda Morales in my old hood. I don't like that it's attached to a gas station either. Maybe I'm biased against cars and gas and such, but so what. - it definitely affects my experience. IF I decide to try them again sometime in the future I will definitely be calling ahead and getting my order to go.","stars":2.0}

And even though English was not her first language, the woman taking the order did an excellent job of getting every detail correct, down to the odd spelling of names. My family absolutely loved the flavor of the cake and the icing, and even once I confessed that I lied about 'jelly' being the center layer (pickiest eaters ever-could not tell them ahead of time it was guava or they never would have eaten it), they still were raving about the cake.

The day we were there, the inside and outside were packed for lunch. For appetizers, we opted for the Crispy Crab Wontons and the Fried Zucchini. The wontons were not your typical 'crab rangoon'. They had actual crab meat inside that you could see and taste! Awesome! The zucchini sticks came with some Ranch Dressing for dipping and were sprinkled with some chunky Parmesan Cheese. Also, awesome! For entr\u00e9es, we both ordered the Smokehouse B.B.Q. Burger. OMG! If you've never had one of these....you should. It's topped with crispy bacon, melted cheese with crispy onion straws. It comes topped with their B.B.Q. Ranch Sauce (a sweet BBQ sauce) which is delicious. We always ask for more sauce for dipping.

I was looking for a duffle bag that I'd seen at another location and didn't buy, but suddenly, they seem to be gone from all the stores.

{"text":"Berenice, thank you for taking the time to explain everything At the consult, I was not informed that my eyebrows would fade to reveal the undertone color. I was told to expect just fading and that touch ups would be required every year or so. I was actually reassured by you that it would not fade to an undesirable color. Although at the time, you said it would not fade to grey, unlike tattoos, which was what I was worried about at the time. I never had Botox and apply sunscreen daily. I expected the fading. If I had known my eyebrows would fade to this red undertone color, I probably would not have gone through with the procedure.","stars":3.0}

And yes, where was the 10% discount that was promised??? And when I called to express my concerns with the THOUSANDS that I learned that they overcharge, missing discount, etc..., I was basically told, the work is done, the contract is signed and there would be no one else I could even speak with to at least express my concerns and dismay with Power.

{"text":"Cute place on Main Street with a fantastic and HUGE patio. The service was absolutely incredible as was our appetizer of lobster rangoon. The rangoon was service with the tastiest freaking sauce in all the land! Only negatives, which unfortunately was a deal breaker for us: The buffalo chicken salad. It was the special of the day, and we asked if it was \"loaded up\" and we were assured it was. The salad arrived with the chicken (great flavor) tomato and some shredded mozzerella. That; I could have done at home easily. It was very disappointing for 12 bucks. I would definitely go back, but maybe just for drinks and apps on the patio.","stars":3.0}

So when 3 random women showed up they put them in our spot.

{"text":"Breakfast This review is only about the breakfast. Precious wanted a bite to eat before taking off. She saw this place. She got a bowl with scrambled eggs and what they portrayed as chorizo, but let me tell you, it really wasn't chorizo. It was more like the taco meat from Taco Bell, spicy ground beef. The eggs were below average, no salt, no taste. The chorizo [sic] was as described above. It's one of those meals that you regret having. There are only so many calories one can eat without getting fat, and we wasted 500 plus or minus on that. Also, a heads up, I strongly recommend NOT eating here outside of the peak lunch and dinner time. The food is precooked, and it sits for who knows how long before it is served. With an inexperienced staff or on a slow day, that can sit there long enough to get nasty. Usually during the peak periods there's enough turnover that you don't have to worry about it.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"The darlings of social media! 18 Bagels Co. is a such a fun brand to interact with both online and off! I love when a business can share their personality so effortlessly. The move at 18 Bagels is always to get something on the more unique side! Whether that be a colorful lightly sweetened bagel with cookies n cream cream cheese or the pumpernickel with jalape\u00f1o cream cheese. They even have vegan cream cheese. Of course my absolute favorite is the French toast bagel with honey cream cheese. The honey cream cheese is one of those foods that belongs on everything in my opinion. If budget wasn't a thing I would probably keep it in my fridge on a weekly basis. Of course their coffee is equally exciting. The best part how frequently they introduce limited time offerings. It's a great excuse to come back in again and again. 18 Bagels is a great business to preorder from as well! I am not sure how much they advertise this but, what I like to do is call in my order ahead of time (only for a batch of bagels to-go, I wouldn't recommend this if you're wanting a sandwich etc). The only bummer is they won't let you pay over the phone. Colorful bagels, colorful personality and colorful ice cubes (they're made of coffee, so the color is brown-but hey that's a color): color me happy!","stars":5.0}

During the 6 days they had my car, I barely received updates and when I called they were very vague about the status of my vehicle. I reached out to corporate and they knew more about my vehicle than I did. When I asked about compensation for this mess they caused, they just ignored me. I lost out on 4 days of work because of them. I paid for a service that in the end damaged my vehicle and resulted in Mavis needing a 3rd to repair. I feel like I was discriminated against because I am a female. This isn't the first time they told me I needed work done to my car that I now believe DID NOT need. In another unrelated incident, they told me I needed a control arm which I allowed them to replace and come to find out, it was my sway bar links that needed to be replaced. Now, I'm paying for a control that I'm sure I never needed!! I also believe the 4 or more times they had to repair my right rear strut was excessive and a 3rd party should have been in the picture earlier. I tried to be patient and understanding and give them the opportunity to make this completely right but they have failed to do so. I have my car back but I have not been financially compensated for this mess they caused. As a result, I'll be filing a complaint with the Attorney General's office and small claims court. I've called the corporate office in NY and they have not been helpful in addressing my requests for compensation and reimbursement for this fiasco.","stars":1.0}

We got takeout jerk and curry chicken (comes with potato chunks) with some sides. The $5 lunch special includes your choice of meat over rice and one side, the regular size consists of one meat over rice and two sides, and the large size included meat over rice and three sides. We hear the Mac and cheese is good and it must be, for when we went by shortly after lunch it was all sold out. The chicken had great flavor and slices and the cabbage, collard greens, and okra sides were very good. I couldn't finish my meal in one sitting :) I will return when I'm in the mood for some hearty, home cooked grub. I hope to try the snapper on a subsequent visit (priced according to size).

{"text":"Our first time here and what a great experience. My wife and I came to celebrate our 39th Anniversary and I am so glad we did. We had reservations at 5:15 and we were seated promptly. The host presented us with menus and drink\/wine list. Both were quite extensive. Since neither of us drink we cannot comment other than to say those we saw drinking did seem to be enjoying them. Our waitresses Shelly and Amber were really great. After finding out it was our first time to Charley's, Shelly went over the specials and took our drink and appetizer order. Next we were presented with a tray with examples of all of their steak offerings. Everything from a 50oz porterhouse to wagu and bison ribeyes. The wife settled on the 12oz filet and I had the 20oz fabulous filet. Why fabulous you ask? Well there is one per tenderloin, only two per animal. This is the center cut of each tenderloin and melts in your mouth. I even added truffle butter to mine. For sides which are served family style we had lobster mac n cheese and garlic smashed potatoes. APPETIZER Since neither of had ever had it we tried the steak tar tar. While it was very good, I not sure I would have it next time. Nothing wrong just not my taste. Not to worry there are plenty of other delicious looking appetizers. While waiting for our main courses we had the house salad and a basket of cheese bread. The cheese bread was very good and the cheese had the consistency of what you might find on a pizza. Kind of golden brown. As for the salad, while it was very flavorful I thought some of the lettuce was limp. I probably should have said something but didn't. Then again maybe that's just the way it comes out with the vinaigrette. MAIN COURSE Quite simply the very best steak I have ever had. Seared on a 1400 grill, fired with citrus and red oak wood. Cooked perfectly. I wish I had had the truffle butter served on the side. I think I would have enjoyed it more. Lobster mac n cheese was wonderful with good sized pieces of lobster topping it. I would have like to have seen it all the way through but understand why it wasn't. Potatoes were very good but not on the same level as the other side. DESSERT Neither of us finished our steaks as we wanted to save room for dessert. How about shared cr\u00e8me bruelle with fresh berries flamed at the table. Oh and don't forget the salted caramel cheesecake to take home. Best cr\u00e8me bruelle ever. Light, flavorful and the berries were so good. The only reason this isn't five stars is the limp lettuce. I know, pretty nitpicky. I just think that at this level of establishment the salad should rank right up there with the rest of the meal. I will call it 4.75 stars. We will be back.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Growing up, I used to have Korean food at least once a day (thanks Mom!). It's probably the only cuisine that I could eat forever without getting sick of it. I often crave Korean food, but how much I actually eat it has depended on where I've lived. A good amount during the time in the SF Bay Area (thanks to more Korean-food-loving friends), a small but still surprising amount when in Pittsburgh (thanks to a lunch spot somewhat nearby my workplace), but now, in Philly, I've been eating a pathetic amount of Korean food--I hardly ever have Korean food anymore. That is in large part to the dearth of Korean food places in Center City. This is all about to change. Cue Seorabol. A restaurant with street cred from super North Philly, Seorabol has the most Korean feel of the limited Korean options we have here. Even the small touches of the banchan (side dishes) that are unlimited help with the Korean atmosphere. The food has been generally pretty solid.

First thing you should know, If you want a dive bar that's in the city then The Vous is your spot. That's what the bar seems to nickname itself. It isn't too expensive, the service isn't too nice, the food isn't too great, but it definitely isn't bad either. The best thing about Locust Rendezvous is their lunch special. I forget the exact price but it is something like $6 for a hamburger and fries for lunch. Cheese is extra, which I always thought was pretty funny. Who ever heard of paying extra for cheese? The drinks are pretty standard. It's a good place to get wine and beer. The liquor, like most places, isn't so cheap. They are known for their Spanish Fries. I had them last night when I went for happy hour with an old friend. They were pretty awesome. I have also had their buffalo chicken salad before and that was pretty good. When I was younger they would take the IDs of everyone at the table and scan them. I thought that was a bit overbearing, but maybe they had problems with underagers in the past. Once, my friend didn't have his ID with him and they wouldn't even let him stay and watch us drink. Kinda not cool. Weirdest part about this place is the bathrooms. It's as if they somehow took a back storage closet and turned it into two bathrooms with some extra thick cardboard walls. The bathrooms are tiny and have a narrow entrance to get to them and just seem really strange. All things considered, I like Locust Rendezvous. All of the bad things I named before are actually kind of charming. It has reasonably cheap drinks, decent food, and a great location. I really enjoy going there. Thanks for the drinks!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Terrific hotel and location! We stayed four nights and had four restful nights sleep. One block from Bourbon St, so it's convenient to everything but not noisy. Royal St is a street with lots of antique and upscale shops, so the venue is very nice. Service was excellent and not annoying - e.g. when we checked in the desk clerk asked if we needed assistance with our luggage - we didn't - no bellman descended on us. The room was made up early on 2 of the 3 days and always very nicely. The restaurant was under renovation while we were there but we did have drinks at the carousel bar - the bar itself, the drinks and the service were all top notch. This is an older hotel - so the room we had was smaller than typical \"modern\" chain hotels - the king bed was a king bed but the dresser drawer space was limited in amount. No problem for my wife and I, we prefer the ambiance. Overall a great experience - definitely recommend!","stars":5.0}

At least my table didn't rocked and at least it was spacious enough for me. Back then, I was a big boy and boy those little NYC seatings were not comfortable! Made me feel like Ian from the Simpsons if you know what I mean... Anyway, I got the cool rice dish where they poured gravy over it and it was a solid dish. I felt like I was eating one of those sticky rice from dim sum to be honest. My date got her ramen before I got my dish by like 15 minutes. She ended up watching me eat, which would've been no problem if this was like 9 years ago.... I would've wolfed it down in minutes, but I took my time. That being said, they also screwed up the order for the drink's. My date had to remind them to bring out her drink, but they end up bringing us both a drink. No worries, we knew it was hectic..

The only way I can describe it is bland. Like, shockingly and amazingly bland to the point I suspect the only reason people rate this place high is portion size. I ordered a burger and my husband ordered the French dip sandwich. Neither of us bothered to even eat half. I tried his thinking the au jus sauce would help and even that had no flavor and did not help the dry meat in his sandwich at all. So disappointing. The onion rings were crispy so I'll toss them an extra star for that.

The meatball I give 3.5 stars only because they were a little on the moist\/juicy Side. Almost too moist. Now I do like my meatballs on the dryer side but these were super moist.

{"text":"I have particularly valid grievances to persuade you that DP Dough is an appalling choice. For TLDR readers, \"Don't order unless you have no other choice.\" But please read on, as I've ordered from them more than 7 times and only recall the last 7 due to a new habit of writing down individual review notes in a notebook. Over 2 years, my memory and notes recall that recently 6 out of the 7 times, DP Dough screwed up by: 1) Forgetting 2x $1.00 DP Dogs, drinks, toppings, entire entrees: whole calzones... afterwards, yelling at me, directly naming me, \"The biggest liar\"; also at my girlfriend on a different occasion. I was (and still am) very polite and even tipped $10 on a $30 order. 2) Forgetting the main ingredients (meats)- both the bacon and ham of a \"Ham Zone\" (so it's only mozzerella and ricotta), chicken on a \"Speed Zone\" (so it's only mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, spinach). Mind that each Zone is about $7-$8, and is extremely simple with few ingredients. How they forget integral parts of the calzones that only have 3-5 toppings is absurd! 3) Ignoring extra toppings I ordered. They are %0.50 or $1 a topping, yet they missed $4 to $6 of extra toppings... twice. 4) Twice spilling sauces inside the container, which is excusable. 5) The drivers\/bikers charge $2.00 for delivery, which is fine, even though I usually tip 20% on top. However, they almost always arrive late with the food cold, or with missing items. I'm pretty sure either the management is either trying to save money, or hire incompetent drivers who eat parts of my order. Why do I keep ordering from them? I believed over 2 years of several complaints, even to corporate, either they changed employees over time. That and I didn't have groceries late at night. The worst part is that on a distinct occasion, the manager snidely screamed at my one of my friends, aside from a different incident with my girlfriend, during an 8 person order, and called her a liar. The fact is, we were missing her individual $15 order, and we were stupid enough to tip the driver well! I had stopped tipping them online due to incredibly poor service. We were being very reasonable and called them directly after picking up and opening the order. They responded that they saw and remembered the order go out the door. *I highly doubt they remember 1 calzone out of 8, especially when they have orders from many other people*. We even waited 3 hours for it! Food Review: Each calzone is a plain, dry (sometimes soggy), simple chaos of a creation. Here is roughly how they make their $7-$8 calzone, which can cost more than $10 with extra toppings: Step I: Put average quality cheese in low quality pizza dough Step 2: Put very low quality ingredients on the cheese. Step 3: Bake and deliver. They taste bland, but good because they are simple. Their ingredients and meats are very poorly done. Their pizza dough is mostly very","stars":1.0}

The driver seemed harried, and when asked the time to the next shuttle he said \"15 mins\". Something did not feel right. I called the company and they were surprised they had a full shuttle on the way, because the person working the counter said they only had 4 cars left. I told him there were more of us waiting, and he put me on hold to \"check on things\". After 11 mins on hold I realized he was never coming back. I hung up and called again, only to be told (despite my reservation and confirmation number) they were out of cars. I asked how they planned to accommodate me and they said I should call back tomorrow - maybe there would be cars then. So I paid $50 to take a cab to my hotel and had to beg and borrow rides from coworkers to get to my meetings and back to the airport.

The aisle is loooong (and therefore, perfect for weddings and brides that want to have a nice looong entrance), the stained glass is breathtaking, and the old style alter and pulpit (ok, I'm Catholic, I am not sure if it's called a pulpit in our church, but you get what I'm talking about, the place where people read from) is carved white wood with a spiral staircase leading up to it. It's simply a gorgeous church. There's even an upstairs. This used to be one of the hugest parishes in the city, but over the years, the neighborhood as well as Catholic \"participation\" diminished, so most masses are fairly empty. Regardless of that fact, the parish has kept this church in impeccable condition. I almost hate to bring down a star for this, but you have to consider it, the neighborhood is not so stellar. It does make it a slightly less desirable location when you aren't too thrilled with the prospect of having to leave your car in the parking lot. I have hope this neighborhood will turn around someday because between the architecture and the plain old lay out of the neighborhood, there's a lot that can be done. Until then, though, I have to keep these factors in mind.","stars":4.0}

The sushi was fresh, robatayaki was the star of the meal (octopus was delish, so tender!), brussel sprouts were v flavorful so be prepared for that. Wouldn't recommend the cod fried rice- v bland. Go for the drinks, all the cocktails were on point (I enjoyed the gin-base Re-Animator). As for the service, our waiter was the least accommodating, asking us to put all our food orders in at the beginning of the meal, a little challenging with a small plate style restaurant. He got several orders wrong and proceeded to argue with us about what we said vs what he heard before bringing the correct dish out. We were celebrating a friend's birthday so we ordered dessert prior to the meal and our waiter offered to put a sparkler in it, which he forgot about until after the dessert was placed on the table...

I arrived around 6:15 the following day. I waited about 30 minutes before someone approached me to do my service. When I indicated that the owner had agreed to do my nails he said ok and walked away.

{"text":"5 Stars for great food and an awesome dining experience I won't go into too much detail as there's already enough raving reviews. My bf and I were in Tampa for a wedding and decided to try Bern's. Luckily, we were able to get a last minute reservation on a Friday night. The lobby is filled with old Victorian decor and dark red lighting..not really what I was expecting. The restaurant is sectioned off into smaller dining areas. We were seated almost immediately. The noise level was fairly low (which I like). Being known for having the largest wine cellar IN THE WORLD, I was curious to check out their wine list. A meager 10 pages or so? That's it? Half of them being Kendall Jacksons and Mondavis. My bf then hands me a 200 pg book - the REAL wine list. Holy Cow! I had no idea where to start. We requested the sommelier, who was able to give us some great recommendations within our price range. We chose a '96 St Emilion. Very balanced, great full flavor that just got better through the night. The menu is many many pages long. It goes into extensive detail about the cut of each steak, the degree of cooking, the char (mm..I love a good char). My bf and I love dry-age so we went with the 36 oz porterhouse for 2, medium rare. Even though it comes with a french onion soup, salad, baked potato, and vegetables, we still ordered 2 additional appetizers..it's not everyday we're in Tampa. Steak was perfectly cooked. The dry age flavor was very distinct (and maybe not for everyone) but definitely one of the best I've had. Service was great throughout the night. We were never rushed and glasses were always filled. I asked to box up my 2 bite piece of steak and our server included fresh veggies. He even took off the wine label and put it on a \"in memory of your dinner at Bern's\" card. We were extremely stuffed but saved just enough room for desert. We were taken into the kitchen with some other diners for the restaurant tour. This is the actual working kitchen where the steak is sliced to order. We move to the wine cellar. Literally, thousands (maybe millions? I forget) of bottles of wine. The expensive ones are bubbled wrapped and kept behind a locked gate. You can tell the staff is extremely knowledgeable and takes pride in their collection. Our tour ended upstairs in the desert room. Each party gets a private area, complete with a selection of music, including a live pianist who you can call to request songs. Our creme brulee was a great finish. Bern's is really one of kind. It's a little on the pricey side but definitely worth it. I don't know if I'll make my way back down to Tampa again, but I hope I do!","stars":5.0}

I find myself craving it now that I live in Cambridge all the time. The other sandwiches are also amazing, according to my friends who've ordered them as is the matzo ball soup. For those who complain about price - wtf? Rachael's seriously puts 3\/4 lbs. of corned beef on my Reubens - and they're in the highest rent district in the city.

Our tour guide, Will, was very knowledgeable although sometimes he talked too fast and I didn't know what he was saying. One of the coolest things was the pre-Prohibition steel piece that they are using today. The process of how they make their gin with a vapor basket is also very cool. After the tour, we went to the tasting room and cocktail bar. It's a swanky, dim room with a massively lit-up bar. I really like the feel of the place. We had a tasting of two gins, some whiskeys, and some absinthe. The tasting went a little quickly for me, but they were quality smooth liquors. The absinthe was also surprisingly smoother than at other places I've tried it. As for cocktails, I knew I wanted something simple so I chose the Birth of a Legend with cranberry infused quinoa-whiskey and puma cola. Very flavorful \"mixed drink.\" My friends got the Juliet an Romeo, a gin and cucumber drink that was a little too crisp for my liking. The 8.00see on Bodacious was complex but I didn't enjoy the frothy egg component. We were all happy with the choices we made though. And it was a high quality cocktail for about $8. We sat in the courtyard with hanging lights and chatted for a while (until the train blew by us crazy loud). One of my favorite distillery experiences.","stars":4.0}

I explained the situation with the window not going down more than a couple of inches without cutting into the speaker. I told him we spent hundreds on 2 cars about a yr and a half ago. He said he appreciates our business and they would look at it no charge when I asked if it would cost anything. He said first come, first served. I was 3rd in line just about 9am when they opened and left the car with him. I didn't hear from them and called at 5pm. They said I was all set but didn't take the time to call me, saying they were sorry. I picked up the car and he said the screws had come loose so they tightened them really well for me. While I appreciate the fact that they fixed it for free, what an inconvenience to have my car there all day!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"A long, long time ago in a St. Louis that seems far, far away from what it is now, my girlfriend (now fiance) and I were at a friend's party preparing for our first experience here. In our conversation with the host's friend (former editor of social media, I believe, of Sauce Magazine), she asked where we were heading to eat. Upon revealing that we had reservations at Trattoria Marcella, she responded with a really serious, \"Oh, you are really going to enjoy it.\" Sigh. What can be said about Trattoria Marcella? From the atmosphere to the food, it really is a great place to dine. For the first visit, we indulged in their toasted ravioli to start. Had people of other states or cities been able to know what we were eating, they would have rued the bad fortune which had afflicted them with living so far away. These plump, meat-filled raviolis are awesome. Had I any less appreciation for a long-lived life and the respect of my special lady, I would have gorged on them until my stomach burst. Nevertheless, what was to come would further justify not doing so. At this time, they were serving a gnocchi dish with pork shoulder, which has since been removed (the world became a little darker because of it). In 30+ years of life, I cannot remember eating any Italian cuisine which had been made so perfectly. Everything, from the preparation of the meat to the use of salt was outstanding. April chose the cannelloni for her meal and, despite the feeling that it had a little too much cheese (she's not a huge fan of cheese), she thought it tasted great too. A year plus after our first visit, I took my dad here before he passed away. He was in town from Lincoln, NE and he was looking for a good dinner. He had previously been to Maggiano's for his last good Italian diner (another good establishment), but had never tried Trattoria Marcella. We started with the bread and hummus they had out and he enjoyed it; this is significant because he does not normally like hummus. We also shared an order of the toasted ravioli as an appetizer, which, much like the first visit, was amazing. For the meal, he chose the very same cannelloni dish that April ordered and, being a huge friend of cheese, he not only enjoyed it mightily, but held that it was the best Italian food he's ever had. On a side note, having seen that they had drinks with absinthe (formerly illegal in the U.S.), I endeavored to try it. Have not found any establishments outside of Trattoria Marcella that served absinthe and, despite not having a huge taste for alcohol anymore, I had to try this spirit. It has been about seven months since I have been here, but both times, separated by a year or more, have been consistently delicious. This really is a great restaurant and, best of all, it will not wreck your wallet when compared to the likes of","stars":5.0}

I used to be a fan of the tempura udon until I discovered my new love, the sashimi case. There you can find a variety of sashimi grade filets. Today they had salmon, tuna, tuna belly, yellowtail, escolar, and even some unagi. Pick what you want and take it to the counter. Not only do they slice it for you but if you eat here they plate it for no extra charge! I got a good portion of salmon and a miso soup for under $8 and in under 4 minutes. If there's a better sashimi deal in town, I'll be shocked but also I need to know because I'm a sashimi addict now. Just as an aside, the kitchen closes from 2-4.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I'm not sure what has happened with Mesa Cafe. We used to come here and the food was decent, but it has gone way down hill. I ordered the Cesar salad with chicken a couple of weeks ago and the chicken was extremely chewy and had no flavor. I looked it up and it is known as \"woody\" chicken. I was so disgusted that I couldn't eat any of the chicken and barely ate the lettuce. I decided to give them another try and ordered the fish tacos a few weeks later. We also ordered the avocado egg rolls and crab cake starters. The starters came out in literally 3 minutes and looked like they had been made hours earlier and reheated. They were lukewarm and not fresh tasting at all. Then the fish tacos came out about 10 minutes later and did not look appetizing at all. It looked like they had taken the leftover fish they had from the day and chopped it into tiny pieces and stuck it in the microwave. It was steaming hot and tasteless and it made me nauseous just looking at it. I ate the side salad and barely touched the fish. I am so disappointed since this used to be a good go-to spot. I will not be back anytime soon.","stars":1.0}

We understand they may be having personnel issues, but we really appreciated the managers service for recognizing the staffs shortcomings. We will be coming back. Food was delicious as always. We are usuals at the Collingswood branch but they closed down so we decided to try out the philly location. I'm giving a 2-star and that's being generous. Our waitress did nothing but pour our water and bring our check. They didn't even come by to change our appetizer plates to entree plates. We were waiting so long that we ordered through the manager because our waitress kept walking by our table but never made eye contact. After 20-25 mins of waiting, we asked for the manager and ordered through him. The restaurant was not busy at all for this to have happened. We have always had a good experience at IndeBlue in Collingswood, but very disappointed with the Philly location. Hope their service gets better but we'll be back, only because the food is delicious.

As I write what appears to be their first Yelp review I'm enjoying a Morning Mojito pour over while sitting in the parking space parklet out front of their main entrance on Roff Way (Due North of the Wingfield Park band shell off of First St @ N. Arlington) . A small place that takes their coffee seriously while still being friendly and laid back. My drink was made by one of the owners, Missy, who is also one of the owners of Blind Dog Tavern. I ordered it lite sweet & lite cream...just like I do anytime I'm near a Philz. I found out about this place from my barber & fellow Philz fan Nick around the corner at Derby Supply. Thanks Nick! For those of you who've never had a mojito style coffee drink before, you're going to want to give this a try...and for those of you who are familiar...so will you.

{"text":"I am not a touchy-feely-aura-voodoo-new age type person despite being from California or having Louisiana lineage. However, this place had a bad vibe. The hostess was nice. She sat me, my friend and her dog on the patio. About 5 minutes later she apologizes for the waiter not having approached us yet and stated she would remind him. Another 10 minutes passed and our waiter charged the table chastising us for having sat ourselves. I explained that the hostess had sat us. At that point we should have left. We still didn't have menus, nor did the table next to us who had been there before we arrived. The band was fine. The decor was nifty. The patio was lovely, even at night. Our server's attitude did not improve, nor did the frequency of his visits to any of the tables. Parts of our order were missing or incorrect or far from tasty. My pal had a Mojito assuming it would be fabulous given the name of the establishment. In fact, that was the only thing that was NOT tasty. The rest of the meal was tasty enough for her to return the next evening. She informed me that despite a different wait she had bad vibes and a not so nifty experience but I'll let her review it.

Grill was clean and everything was cooked well. Second time was for dinner. Take out. Placed the order. They were nice and accommodating when I wanted to add something to my order. But when I got home and saw my sushi which was the same as I ordered the first time, it was nothing like what I got before. It didn't even taste the same and there were bits of shrimp. No yellowtail was anywhere to be found. I was so disappointed. I live about 15 min away and wasn't about to go back. My BF ate what I didn't want and we dealt w it. I also got hibachi veggie noodles which is just lo mein basically. But the \"veggie\" part was just onions and slivers of carrots. And the vegetables they gave as a side weren't cooked all the way. It was nothing like the veggies we got w the shrimp hibachi on our first visit. I'll give this place another try and hopefully it's like the first time.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"A friend and I made our first-ever visit to the Gathering Place the other night. It is very large with plenty of standing room and shuffleboard, pool, and video games. They even have bands come in on occasion. Even though it's a Vandal bar, one of the bartenders was respectful and even cracked a football joke when I walked in with my Boise State shirt. Unfortunately here is where the rating suffers dramatically. That night we played a lot of shuffleboard and had a lot of fun doing so. Our drinks were kept away from the table so as not to interfere with our play. When my friend tried to knock my puck off the table, it smacked the far end of the table wall. This happened right when an individual staggered out of the back office, which was located nearby. Suddenly he yelled out \"NOT SO HARD!!!\" with an aggressive look on his face. The place was somewhat packed and other people did not even notice any loud noises. I have played shuffleboard at many places with the same style of play without any objection from any staff member or owner. So I went over to the person, who turned out to be drunk out of his mind, to ask what we did wrong. When I tried to state my case, he cut me off and shouted back in a brusque tone, \"I don't care! You better keep it down over there!\" He then shuffled off before I could say another word. This individual was later identified as the owner of the establishment. So I went back and suggested that we finish our game and immediately leave the bar. I personally won't be returning here, as there are much better and more professional ways to handle this situation, especially if you're the owner of the establishment representing the business. Perhaps these people are forgetting the fact that there are other options in town.","stars":2.0}

We told the lady at the counter, that we weren't interested in the food, and that we were going to leave. She forced the food on us, bringing it out to the car. When we said that we didn't want the food because of our mouse phobia, she said the two things weren't related... Isn't that weird??? Mice in a restaurant and eating the food, not related? She, then went on to inform us that mice are everywhere and that it didn't make sense to her why we didn't want the food. I shall leave that up to your interpretation, what she means as mice being everywhere. Yes, they are everywhere unfortunately, but they shouldn't be freely roaming around a facility that serves food. What do you think? She also refused to refund us our money and we only asked for the refund when we saw how unreasonable she was being. So fyi, we went to class hungry and with less money in our grad school eating out fund. Thank you owner of Pizza Palace, for not being understanding, for trying to force that food on us, and for making me miss my Maryland eateries that much more.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I am a big fan of Global TV. Linda Steele and Gord are great news anchors. News hour final covers not only local news, but events from around the globe. It doesn't hurt that in addition to being professional, both anchors are good looking! I love Julie Matthews' Trouble Shooter reports that alert viewers of consumer scams. In fact, the only other news program that is similar in quality to the News Hour, is CBC News with Peter Mansbridge. I watch both, and I like both equally. Some other shows on Global TV are: House, NCIS, Project Runway Canada, SNL, The Simpsons, Family Guy, The Office and Entertainment Tonight. Basically, Global TV showcases programs for people of all ages and interests. Being a huge Simpsons and Family Guy fan, I feel obligated to thank Global for showcasing new episodes. The only other TV station that shows new episode is FOX.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I went here on a whim late one Saturday evening with my cousin for a quick dinner. I honestly would have never known this restaurant was here if she didn't tell me about it. It's located right before where business 30 merges onto King Street in Paoli. It's back a bit, not directly on the street so it's easy to miss. SO glad I went that night though because I was pleasantly surprised and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. All of their tables were full so we sat at their bar, which I must say was very nice and appropriately sized to eat a meal at. We told the bartender who took our order about my cousins nut and sugar allergy and he double checked the ingredients of everything she ordered with the chef, and did so very nicely (which has been an issue other places.. believe it or not.) I ordered the bruschetta to start and followed with the ravioli alla panna (a spinach and ricotta stuffed ravioli in a light cream sauce.) I loved every bite of each dish. The bruschetta was well toasted and the tomato and mozzarella on top was a tasty combo without too much of either. The ravioli was melt in your mouth yumminess. Nice and light, the best ravioli I have had in this area. I have only been here once, but I would most definitely go again. It looks like a nice place for a date. Nice ambiance, friendly service, and really, really good food.","stars":4.0}

I had to wipe down my own table an booth twice it was so bad . Then had ask for forks that were clean because every fork in the been had food residue on it. Then almost every bottle of soy sauce, mustard, and chili paste were filthy as well. The food came out at least on clean dishes but I couldn't take it . I just left even after paying for the food .

{"text":"The trick to having a good experience is going when the place isn't busy. The last time we went (12:30 on a Saturday), we were so frustrated because the meat servers kept passing our table when our green cards were up, and it was very stressful. We had to constantly wave someone down and we often felt ignored (and very very hungry!). We decided to give it another try this Saturday and got there at 11:30. There were only 3 other parties in our area by then so the servers came by every few minutes without ever passing us, it was great! I enjoyed every single meat serving, though some did need a little bit more salt. The food at the market table is fantastic. The fruit is very fresh and the parfaits are honestly the best I've ever had. They have a waffle and omelette bar now, but the star there is the syrup. I literally went and basically poured the syrup onto an empty plate and added a few fruits to pretend I wasn't just about to spoon that syrup into my mouth by itself lol. And I'm not even a syrup person! It was definitely one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had- the food was amazing and non-stop. We left very happy, satisfied, and stuffed. I wish I could give it 5 stars but alas, the last experience deserved only 1 star.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I really wanted this place to be above average since it is in my neighborhood. Unfortunately, it was on the border if not below average. No problem getting a reservation on Friday night - not necessarily a good thing. The waiter was attentive, which should be expected when the place is practically empty. We ordered crab and shrimp cakes and steak tartare for appetizers. They were both good but we've had better interpretations of both around town. My wife had chicken marsala with house made pasta and side salad. The chicken and pasta were nice. The salad was a little wilted. My hanger steak came out the first time overcooked at medium well when I ordered it medium rare. I reluctantly told the server and she happily took it back. A few minutes later, the second attempt came out and it was rare bordering on raw. I ate it and it tasted fine with the sauce, but when you pay over $20 for a steak you expect it to be cooked as you ordered, especially in a less than crowded restaurant where the cooks have adequate time to focus. With the proven options in east Nashville, I doubt we'll give this place another chance. I wanted it to succeed but it doesn't seem likely when nothing in the menu stands out and steaks can't be properly cooked to temp.","stars":3.0}

It wasn't until walking the French Market on a super hot and muggy day that I said \"what the hey\" and gave this place a go. They had tons of flavors and I couldn't decide which to choose, but thought the wedding cake sounded appealing (cake batter makes for tasty ice cream after all) and that the egg custard sounded horrendous. The kind feller working the counter overhead my thought process and suggested I sample them. He jokingly mixed up the flavors on me to trick my brain, and boy-o-boy was I wrong. The egg custard was the sweetest thing and when mixed with secret creamy sauce and ice it created a consistency that far exceeded any plain old sno cone I've ever had. I must admit that I totally underestimated those icy balls, and now I long for more.","stars":5.0}

Since being at Anytime Fitness, I have lost 264 pounds, all through weight training and nutrition and felt Anytime Fitness gave me the necessary tools to do what I needed to achieve success. They are great at testing classes to find what the interest level is among its members and the managers are always open for suggestions on how to better meet the needs of those who attend.

Sat down at the end of the lunch time rush. 2 servers working, but took more than 10 minutes after we sat, and me asking for a server, before anyone came to our table. Our server, once she finally made an appearance, was very slow, inefficient, and lacked any customer service skills, bordering on rude. My dining companions each got a burger and both said were really good, but didnt top Five Guys, and price was $13+. I got the brisket, without a bun.

Having walked around the beach for half the day, we were pretty famished. I walked up to the friendly dude in front and ordered my destiny: a Margherita Pizza with Pepperoni. She ordered a Pesto Mozzarella with EXTRA fresh mozz curds. WHAT. If you love mozz, you must try the curds. It is worth suffering lactose intolerance for. Let it flow into you and out of you in one smooth motion. The pizza is then metiulously placed into a brick oven where it bakes to heavenly perfection. Your masterpiece is complete and you can die knowing that this pizza was made just for you. It's about 10-12\" and enough to feed half an Asian girl. Just the right amount of sauce. A respectable amount of pull from the cheese. Crispy pepperoni slices exploding grease into your mouth. It's good. We walked out with our remaining slices and immediately we were bombarded with pedestrians asking us for a slice. We pointed them to Persona's and had to beat them off Walking Dead style.

Laid back, simple, and delicious.

Glancing over the menu, everything seemed to be on the more expensive side. The service was poor. It was busy there, and I understand that, but I was at the bar and still had to wait at least 10 minutes until I got a refill on my sangria (which by the way, had one cherry and a bunch of crushed limes and lemons and seeds....it was supposed to be berry). There were 4 people behind the bar, which seemed like more then enough for how busy it was, and twice, I watched as a bartender looks at my glass and kept it moving.

And it's not that as I'm so euphorically loading up my basket with all my ingredients that I lose all sense and bearings. I'm telling you that I legitimately get lost in this place. Oooh man do I love an H Mart. This Cherry Hill location got some twisty turny aisles and some kinda really nutsy layout... There are all these random mirrored pillars in the middle of nowhere... What was this place before it was a wonderland of Asian ingredients?! The only thing that has me not frantically screaming, \"Is this some kinda gahdamn funhouse?!\" is the fact that those mirrors fairly slimming, so like, hey alright. Anyway, as it is printed on H Mart's shopping bags, it is so: \"The Best of Asia in America.\" I'll agree with that shopping bag slogan. I consistently find what I'm out to buy, eventually. I do tend to be sauce and condiment heavy on these excursions. Those bags of mine are heavy with tubs, jars, and cans a-plenty. I stock up on gochujang, sambal olek, fish sauce, fermented black beans, Bulldog tonkatsu sauce, Lee Kum Kee oyster and hoisin...the now ubiquitous Huy Fong Sriracha... and on and on. Tons of different brands here. I appreciate the many choices cause I tend to be a brand loyal type o' gal, and, for instance, I need to have Pearl River Bridge Mushroom Soy sauce on hand at all times for secret recipe or two. So you'll find all manner of noodles, nori, miso, tofu, kimchi, frozen dumplings, everything, everything... Now it's just like I'm just reading off my grocery list to you. Lemme add, the produce section is extensive and wonderful too. Roots and gourds galore! Give me all the herbs and chiles. Good times. The only thing you won't find here is the food court that other H Marts offer. That's the only thing I miss: Shopping and a lunch reward. Ah well.

I had the fish tacos and ordered two for $12. The tacos are so small that I finished one in 3 bites. It also literally had 1 oz of fish deep fried in a heavy batter that you couldn't even taste the fish. It was the worst fish taco that I ever had. The fact that each taco was $6 is a joke! Most of the fish was deep fried batter. After the meal I wondered how any chef could send something out like that. He\/she should be embarrassed. Needless to say this was my second and last visit to El Camino.

{"text":"Whata hidden gem of Glenside! When I was a sophomore at Arcadia my roommate introduced me to this place and I'm hooked! The food is a little pricy but understandable since it is a small family run business. I usually just go with my mom when she's in town for lunch. The soups are a must for me, they change every time I go but seriously all of their soups are amazing. I've had both salads and sandwiches there as well. Both are very tasty. I've only had a pastry once and wasn't really a fan. I got the cheesecake and it just didn't do it for me. There isn't much seating in the restaurant so don't go with a big group, that would be a pain. It's very cute with books and a fire place and the entire staff is very friendly!

If you can understand my needs after a long shift at work where I am so tired and delirious with hunger, you are the place! Let me start with their pizzas. The dough is great. They can do it hand stretched or thin crust. I prefer the hand stretched. Pizzas are big enough to split, but I always come here really hungry and love splitting a salad (which are great here) and pizza. It is just all so good. Most recently there were some new menu offerings: I tried their fig and prosciutto pizza. It had fig, prosciutto, goat cheese, and arugula. While I think it could have had more fig, prosciutto, and goat cheese and less arugula---it was still a great pizza. They have wine and beer offerings as well as those delicious salads and pastas. Oh and if you want to enjoy the sin of all sin, order the pazookie and thank me later. Awesome location with a great ambiance!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"So what would make me travel 30 plus minutes into Trenton besides spending time with my family? Of course fried chicken! This is a small, expanding Central American chain. It has been over a decade since I last visited Central America but I was able to reminisce (a little) on this visit. Now on to the food. I really wish the American version included the kick of spice that is included in the original Central American recipe. I also see they make it a point to advertise they use hormone-free chicken which I appreciate. However, there is barely any white meat to this citrus fried chicken, just crunchy skin. The sides are okay I would get the french fries and yucca fries and skip the others. I appreciated the labels describing the Horchata, Jicama, and Tamarindo juices in english. Even for someone like me, who is familiar with them, it was useful in my decision-making. Get the tamarindo lightly tart and sweet to wash it all down. While the service was a bit snappy(i don't expect much from a fast food joint) on my second visit, they were able to quickly fullfill our large order. The area is a bit sketchy and I was a little nervous waiting in the rear parking lot while my family arrived. But atleast they have a parking lot and I didn't have to search for street parking, which may have been impossible. Follow the large arrow to the left of the store front to find the parking lot.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I waffled between a 3- or 4-star but I settled on 3. First I'll say that the wait staff was very friendly and helpful. But the food was nothing really special. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with it, just nothing I haven't had elsewhere. Let's start with the alligator gumbo. It was a bit too spicy for me and lacked salt. The alligator meat was like tough chicken. But it was ok. I had the oyster po boy. It was a good sandwich, but it's hard not to compare it with B's Po Boy in Fountain Square. The oysters are tasty in both places but much bigger here. Still B's bun is far superior than the standard hoagie bun used here. Also the tomato on the sandwich at GR's seemed out of season and cut too thick. I removed it. Overall, I'd give B's the win on the sandwich. All in all, it's a decent restaurant with a nice staff and a great ambience. But I had to skip dessert as all selections were too pricey.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Harvest last night just for fun on a random Tuesday. We chose the restaurant because the reviews are great and we really are into the restaurant's mission. Farm to table issues are our \"thing\". First off, the restaurant was extremely empty, which can be a good and bad thing. I know it's a Tuesday in a down economy, but still... The service was great, but perhaps too great. Our waitress hovered over us. She was perfectly nice about it, though, and I got the sense that she was trying to provide quality attention - just not our style I guess. The menu is limited and seasonal. We expected that given the farm to table mission. I would also note that this is not the most vegetarian friendly place. There was only one pasta dish that would appeal to a veggie. We chose to split gnocchi as an appetizer and chicken for dinner. Both were good. I'd give them a 7 or 8 on a 10 point scale. The gnocchi was fairly unique and we really enjoyed that dish. The chicken was supposed to be Southern style as it came with mashed potatoes, cole slaw, corn bread, and BBQ sauce. It was perfectly good, but coming from Nashville I would say it could have been better. Overall, a solid food experience, albeit not off the charts. My 3 star rating versus the 4 star I considered is due to the ambiance. The inside was nicely decorated, but boring. The noise level was eerily quiet. There just didn't seem to be much going on. Even if we had gone on a Friday or Saturday I don't think it would have improved much... We would go back if a friend really wanted to try Harvest out, but I don't think it would be our choice again.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I ordered the flaming breakfast with an extra egg, scrambled, no potatoes, add spinach and mushrooms. The waitress said she would substitute the egg for the potatoes, then she charged me $1.40, Then there was a $1 charge for spinach and there is maybe to small leaves shredded, and $1 for mushrooms and there was maybe 4 tiny slices, plus bacon had 1 piece broken up. So I had to pay $3.50 to add bacon to it. Then my total came to $21. This had goat cheese and was supposed to be a $12.99 breakfast. It was pretty to see the Flamb\u00e9 part of it, but It didn't taste that good. I definitely won't order it again.

Sure, as we first walked in an associate gave us the whole Rooms To Go Pitch, but they kept a safe distance after that and made themselves available at the drop of a dime if we had any questions.

The dinner food was good but nothing really special that makes us really crave it again. It is not terrible, definitely a place I would go back to but maybe because of this whole COVID scare they are probably struggling to get better ingredients. I ordered the shrimp tacos and they were really bland. The mexican street corn dip was good. There was a good selection of kids meals too. Service by our waitress could have been a little better, however, again, the COVID situation is not helping anyone so I really wouldn't judge that as much.

I wish I knew her name to give her a shout out.

And then I became vegetarian and the only thing I like from them is their taco salad. Sadly, they have completely overhauled that too. I am very disappointed. The shell is now shallow, instead of a big deep bowl. There were maybe two handfuls of lettuce, that could be a generous guess. The picture looks pretty but I promise you there was no additional lettuce underneath. It was terrible. The black beans were watery and flavorless as well. I'm really not sure what happened but sadly this is a breakup review for me. The quality just continues to go down and I see no point in supporting a business like that.","stars":1.0}

I went there just before Valentine's Day in search of the newly re-released Guinness Foreign Extra Stout 4-pack. (Note: Winthrop Liquors is one of a select few stores in the area that even carries it.) There were two men working when I came in and I believe one of them was the owner. Both were friendly, knowledgeable, and very helpful. Not being a beer drinker myself (I'm more of a hard cider enthusiast), I was at a bit of a loss in an attempt to create a beer gift basket for my husband. They were a great help in picking out some interesting craft beers and the prices were very reasonable. When I bought more than my clumsy hands could carry, one employee carried the rest to my car for me. They have a great selection, including numerous single bottle craft beers from all over the world.

Unfortunately for my husband and me, we did not drink. When I gently asked the waiter to split the checks, he announced VERY loudly that he was not going to split the check for such a big party.

Excessively large portions, excessively large prices, excessively lavish decor, excessively large stomachs needed. The food is nothing mind-blowing: just your standard American fare generally done well for a lot of money. Every time I eat here, I bring enough food back for a second and maybe even third meal. You've probably seen the crowds milling about the mall exit and wondered why they were all waiting for lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food. I, too have that question, but hey, it's damn good lavish, expensive, chain-restaurant food, and over time has become a bit of an experience unto itself. If you're here, you're probably either celebrating something or rather wealthy. Be prepared to wait, although I've never waited for more than half an hour. Anything that comes with their mashed potatoes is a safe bet, as they're everything mashed should be--large, creamy, delicious, will land heavily in your stomach and fill you up. The fried mac and cheese appetizer is delicious. Fish tacos are my favorite order, I've had good experiences with their chicken chipotle pasta, and any one of their sandwiches is a safe choice--good and economical, as they're on the cheaper end of the massive, massive menu, and they come with a lot of fries. Order what you want to eat, be prepared to take food home, and save room for the cheesecake--it's worth it.","stars":3.0}

Initially, I thought the salad portions looked really small, but I was surprised by how full I was once I finished.

The restaurant itself is very clean and spacious, minimal decor with a white color palette. My only gripe with them is they serve everything in plastic to go containers, which isn't very green of them. I'd prefer to have my meal on a real plate with real utensils if I'm dining in.

From the moment you pull up to the entrance, you will feel like you are in another world, perhaps one in which you are a celebrity. The first thing that you will notice is the large wraparound porch with large rocking chairs and tables, where you can get drinks and snacks during the day and in the evening. Entering into the lobby, you will be amazed at the elegance of the place. Around the hotel, there are several restaurants, none of which I had the opportunity to try out, unfortunately. There is a large gym with brand new, top of the line equipment. There is 1 main pool as well as a small pool. There are also several tennis courts. The rooms are well appointed with flat screen TVs, huge bathrooms, extremely comfortable beds, and a mini bar for your midnight snacking pleasure. There is also a coffee maker with a selection of gourmet coffee which is refreshed daily. As a platinum Marriott member, I was kind of disappointed by the fact that the hotel does not have a concierge lounge. We were, however, given a credit to use towards breakfast (as are all platinum members). Here are a few things to keep in mind if you stay here: - bring dressy clothing (collared shirts, khakis, shoes, etc.), as almost all of the restaurants on the property have a strict dress code - if you want to have a drink on the porch, get there before 10-- it closes way early (in my opinion) - there is a walking mall area down the street, which, unfortunately, also closes early - the beach is a 15-20 minute drive, but it is an amazing beach. In fact, the entire reason we came to St Pete was to go to the beach, but because this hotel was so amazing, we didn't mind the drive at all.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"The classic wet, straight razor shave is something that all men should experience, and this is an excellent place to try this tradition. Trim is about service and value. The staff are superb and friendly. My barber was talented and understood the nuances of straight razor shaves. She was clear as to what to expect, and made sure that I had no important events with photos afterwards (this is REALLY important because you could easily have some areas of irritation on your skin after a straight razor shave no matter how good your barber is. If you do have a wedding, then she will change her technique to include a modern razor and thus minimize the chance of causing a blemish that would be immortalized on photos.) That said, my skin looked better at the end of the straight razor shave than it ever has - this is a big deal. They also included a complimentary shoeshine - a very nice touch. I cannot recommend this place enough.","stars":5.0}

All the food we tried was out of this world. I'm from California, and I SO WISH they had places like this out there. I can't rave about this place enough, doesn't look like much from outside, but this is a perfect case of \"looks can be deceiving' or\" don't judge a book by it's cover\" because it's outstanding!

{"text":"I worked with Bailey (hair) and Gloria (make-up) from La Di Da Beauty on my wedding day. Throughout the planning process, Kenzie was our point of contact for scheduling my trials, collecting feedback, and setting up our day-of hair and makeup timeline. I went in for my first hair and make-up trial months before the wedding date, with plans to head straight to our engagement photos afterwards. The \"bridal bar\" in Reno is super cute and they were very welcoming as I entered for my appointment. Bailey looked through my inspiration and reference photos and designed a loose braid that achieved my romantic vision perfectly. For my make-up, Gloria was very receptive to my Pinterest board (which was, admittedly, all over the place) and stayed over my appointment end time as we tried tweaking a few different things. After the trials, Kenzie collected my feedback and I expressed some issues I had with my make-up and false lashes during the engagement shoot. Gloria was so nice as to offer me a second trial so that we could try to get it right and put my mind at ease leading up to the wedding date. By this point, I think I had a clearer idea of what I wanted, and she was able to nail it perfectly at my second appointment! On my wedding day, they came on-site extremely early in the morning to start setting up. With me, my two bridesmaids, and four VIPs, this meant that they had a very long day without much breaks in-between. I really appreciated how upbeat they were the entire time and we actually ended ahead of schedule. Bailey and Gloria were so patient as many of us have never had had our hair and make-up done professionally before. Everyone loved their look and they really made our \"getting ready\" phase a wonderful experience! I would use Bailey and Gloria both again in a heartbeat for my hair and make-up needs! You couldn't be in better hands on your wedding day (And if I lived closer, I definitely would seek out La Di Da Beauty for their other services.)","stars":5.0}

She is a woman that is caring, kind, and knowledgeable too! I had to come back for fillings. And I told her I have anxiety with the shots and things. She was patient and talked thru it with me. She kept my mind on other things as we talked the whole time. During the procedure she checked on me thru out. And was very caring. I love also the diversity in the office. It's refreshing. The office is clean and has samples of different things up front. They offer coffee, tea, and water. And there's a treasure box for kiddos. All around a wonderful place.

I've contacted them roughly once every two weeks since then and been told repeatedly that someone would be out in a few days to replace my bin. They have never come. Every time I bring my cans down to the curb, all kind of smaller items fall out the bottom of the can, including any broken glass. This is unsanitary and unsafe.

{"text":"I thought I had previously written a review of our meal from Brother Doug's, but apparently not. We tried BD's at the suggestion of our friend who knows the owners well and just raved about their pizza. We actually called a couple of days prior to them being open, unbeknownst to us, because we were really excited about a new pizza joint. Pro: Delivery! I was surprised that they delivered to our house since we are well north of their location, but that was good news. Con: The pepperoni breadsticks\/spirals were very dry and the dough had little to no flavor. The pizza tasted like store bought pizza and the crust had NO flavor. None. Say what you want about a chain like Domino's or Papa John's, but their crust has flavor! To be honest with you, the entire pizza was disappointing. It was very greasy on the bottom, making the pizza incredibly limp and soggy. I wish I had taken a picture of it. We actually threw away most of our order, and that is saying a LOT from folks who love pizza! Was this a fluke? Was this the \"we just opened\" bugs being worked out? I saw another review where the owner posted a response stating that they have been making pizzas for 25 years, so I really am perplexed. The friend who referred us to BD's never asked us what we thought, and for that I am thankful. Again, they are BIG fans. We aren't. Would I try it again? That's hard to say. Maybe if we had a 50% off Groupon we would give it another shot. But there are too many pizza places in Fishers to choose and you REALLY need to on your \"A\" game every single time. I hope the best for this place because other reviews indicate that the owners are nice and want to make a go of it. It takes more than desire. Good luck!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"*This review is only for the service department at West German* I've had my current car for over two years now. My car's engine didn't sound smooth and had a rattling sound a few months after buying the car. Each time I went in to WG BMW to have it serviced, I told the service advisors that my car's engine sounded a bit strange. Each time, they told me everything was alright. Now, two years after complaining to them continuously, a service advisor decides to check on the noise from my engine and let's me know that they're in fact is a problem! On top of that, the problem is big and they need to send it back to BMW for the company to take a look at! And to think I was driving the car around for two years thinking it was okay and that I was just paranoid! Anyways, Great- took them two entire years to realize that I was right! Fortunately, they discovered this before my warranty was over. However, I really find it quite interesting how it took them two years to realize this. They seem to ignore their VALUED customer's opinions (hence my first review about the car key experience). On top of taking two years to realize what I was talking about, They lost my F.O.P (Fraternal Order of Police) badge that was on my license. When I confronted them about it, they told me, \"Well, all you can do is order a new one since we can't do anything about it\". Yes, I can order another one. That's not the problem though. The problem is that it was lost while in service at the dealership and they weren't even apologetic for losing a customer's personal belongings.

{"text":"(seriously, though, I'd probably give this place a 4.5\/5) I've been craving a snoball for as long as I can remember. No exaggeration. I grew up going to fairs in the north, always wishing that my sno-cone tasted what a snoball looked like: fluffy, yet icy; flavourful, yet refreshing. I was finally able to put my tastebuds to the test in NOLA, and I can think of no better place than Plum Street to initiate me into the wild and wonderful ways of the snoball. Not knowing when I might have the chance again, I went for a large. With two flavours. And condensed milk. Plum Street is a small shed-type store with (reliably) a line out the door. Fear not, loyal readers: the line, it moves quickly. With three+ staff members behind the counter, the only thing holding up the line might be *you*, pausing to rethink your flavour combinations. I knew that I wanted to try Bananas Foster, given the history of the dessert in New Orleans. To pair? I was paralyzed with choice, until someone from behind the counter helpfully suggested blackberry. Gilding the sugary lilly was condensed milk and, with those choices locked in, the decision making was done. On to the eating. OHMAHGARSH...so, so great. Unlike the sno-cones of my childhood, the ice making up the snoball was soft, and shaved very finely. This fine grind of ice also played out wonderfully for flavour: instead of syrup collecting in certain chunks of the ice, the flavour soaked through the entirety of the snoball. Yelp note: embracing a go big or go home philosophy here is advisable. You won't regret having *more* snoball, but you sure might regret having not enough. You're welcome for the warning. I think the 'pail' is novel, but seems a lot messier than the cup, especially in weather where the shaved ice melts fairly quickly.","stars":4.0}

They have struck a goldmine between complex the point of confusing or off-putting and so simple you might as well have had a PBJ. The flavor profiles are interesting and the portion sizes are reasonable (a personal pet peeve of most comparable restaurants in Indy).

{"text":"We had been meaning to try Anthony's for some time, but purchasing a Groupon made us actually go! The service was superb; we left 25% for a tip. Yes, there were many members of staff, but each performed a function and did it very well. I've had French Service, which I find pretentious and uncomfortable, and Anthony's was as good as French Service but much less obvious. We sat in the main dining room, so could see city lights from a distance across the room, but a nice view of Finger Rock could be had. The interior decor was nice; ambience was good. The food was very good. Hubby and I shared an Ahi Tuna appetizer. It was nicely presented and featured lots of topping options. The dinner rolls are truly wonderful, served hot with a crispy crust like Italian bread. Hubby liked their ice tea very well. He had rib eye and scallops with mashed potatoes that disappeared in the blink of an eye (he's not usually a mashed potato fan, but said these were fantastic). I had the duck which was very nicely done, and I was very impressed with al dente vegetables. Lots of restaurants do great with the entree, but the vegetables are either cooked to death or hard as a rock. The chef managed to get broccoli, carrots, and squash all cooked appropriately, which is a tough balance as broccoli and carrots take a lot longer than squash. Hubby had salad which he said was excellent, and I had chicken gumbo soup that was superb. Next time I would skip the appetizer to save room for dessert, like Baked Alaska or Cherries Jubilee. As it was I took home 1\/2 my dinner of duck and veggies (yay, leftover duck all for me) and hubby took home 1\/2 his steak. Is Anthony's pricey? Yes it is, however, there is a lot of staff to pay for. We still felt we got our money's worth overall. We would rather have one really nice dinner a month than four pizza dinners a month. It all depends on what matters to you. This is definitely a special occasions restaurant, but I think we will visit more than once or twice a year. A caution as to reservations: I called on a Friday morning for reservations the next day, Saturday, and was told they were full. It's not even high season yet! I did not receive an answer as to how far ahead to book, but maybe one should try calling on Monday for Saturday.","stars":4.0}

The bleu cheese is the perfect blend of creaminess and tang without an overpowering pungency typical of bleu cheese and perfectly complemented by delicious figs. It was tough to decide among the amazing daily entree specials and I chose a savory bread pudding of pulled pork and goat cheese with poached eggs placed gingerly atop.

But my main reason for this review is that I want to give a big shout out to a server named Elizabeth (as printed on the receipt but I believe she goes by Liz or Lizzy). Let me just say, she deserves every single penny she makes there; and more. She was such a joy to have, and just all around cool. She treated us as if we were good friends of hers even though we had only met for the first time and for a relatively short time at that. She seemed happy to have us at her table; as needy as us five could be on a holiday night. Believe me, this is coming from someone who's worked many a holiday or two! Everything we asked for was responded with a prompt, genuine smile and and, \"Absolutely,\" or, \"No Problem.\" Generally speaking, I've experienced bad and mediocre service in the past, but Liz was truly a diamond in the rough and sets the standards of what makes an excellent server. I think I speak for my party when I say she has 5 regulars coming her way very soon. I really hope this review helps her out in someway because she deserves the recognition.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I kind of love Sweetgreen. I think it is a cross between the super fresh ingredients and the location, right near my office. Their staff is super helpful, a number of their ingredients are sourced locally and I can always count on a healthy lunch. they compost a lot of the items they use in store, including napkins and plasticware. I'm also totally loving the tartness of their fro-yo. Perfect as the weather heats up! Like others have said, the food can be pricey. But the freshness of their products, compared to lower price alternatives in the area, is amazing. So, not a go everyday place but a definite treat when a salad is what you are craving.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Meh is all I can really say. It is slightly cheaper than most Mexican places nearby, but I think the food quality is rather sub par. They have nice dinner platters, but it just doesn't make up for the lack of flavor in the food. I opted for the chicken enchiladas, and the chicken inside was pretty close to flavorless - I probably could have made something a lot tastier in my home slow cooker. Disappointed.","stars":2.0}

Well, I've been twice now I'm still not sure if you're supposed to order at the bar or if they come to the tables. They seem under staffed and under trained. This is Magazine Street, it's a new place, I understand that there will be growing pains but where's the owner? Tonight (8pm Sunday) my party of 3 and our dog stopped by to have a bite and a couple of drinks. We went inside and grabbed menus from the bar. The sole server\/bartender said he'd be right with us. We wait outside at a table for 15 minuets. No one came. We saw a single employee\/bartender\/server running around, working hard. He saw us. We saw him. We left. I write this as we enjoy dinner and drinks across the street at Red Dog. I really hope they figure it out because I want The Vintage to be my summer spot.","stars":2.0}

On the plus side, we sat at the bar and had excellent service. Here's the thing. If you are a bar in Indiana and put a breaded tenderloin on your menu, it really ought to be good. This was the worst I have ever had. I thought maybe it was overcooked, but I'm really not sure how it was so chewy. The nachos were scantily clad with few toppings. They were not as bad as the tenderloin, but they were very bad. If you decide to go, just get a flight of beer.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I honestly do not know what to tell you. After months of waiting for the right time to try this place out and the expectancy of a great grass fed burger I'm left speechless. From the moment me and my two children stepped foot in the restaurant I could sense this place was starting to disappoint. There were no host or hostess at the podium, there was a awful band playing extremely loud music in the far left hand corner and to top it off the dining area was poorly illuminated. This place reeked of disaster. I approached the bar and asked, \"can we be seated\" and we were guided to a table that had the light flickering on and off intermittently. So as we sat there for nearly 12 minutes I prepped the kids and stated that in three more minutes we are leaving if we do not get our drinks. At long last, on the fourteenth minute we had a waiter. They must have had two waiters for about 30 people. I couldn't believe it. Our burger experience just kept growing worse. We received our appetizer promptly after all it was just queso and chips. Our main grub now that's another story. The only upside is this, they did make good on the 50% off appetizer that is offered through Yelp and because of the extra long wait for our burgers they did give us a free appetizer. But that's where it ends because I have never in my life tasted a burger without texture and mushy before in my life. Ugh just thinking about it now just... I don't know if they can be called burgers or not it reminds me more of a patty made from soggy bread totally disgusting. Oh, and by the way if you show your Yelp coupon be prepared to be stalked, followed and repeatedly asked ,\"how is everything?\" All in a vain attempt to win you over. All I wanted was a good, no great burger!","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I know that Pi is a popular place, and that it gets packed in the loop, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Since they don't take reservations for 2 people, and being the smart yelper that I am, I called first to check on the wait. They said that by the time I came in, there would be no wait, especially because the concert at the Pageant was about to start. So the bf and I headed down there 10 min later, and he dropped me off so I wouldn't have to walk in the cold (what a gentleman). I walked in, and the snooty hostesses told me there was a 40 min wait. Um there is NO WAY all of those people just showed up in 10 min. Clearly someone fudged the truth to get me to come in. And there wasn't a single seat or place to stand in the bar or the tiny waiting area. I tried to call him to tell him not to park and walk down (he would probably have to walk pretty far) but he wasn't paying attention to his phone, so he never got the message. He walked in, took one look, and I knew we were both on the same page. I politely told the hostesses that they could cross off our name, and then waited by the door while he pulled the car around. They proceeded to stare at me very obviously and whisper during this time, until I left, which is bad business, whether you're a catty hostess that still thinks she is in high school (or maybe still is), or a hostess raving about how fabulous my outfit is. Either way girls, it's rude. Don't get me wrong...the pizza here is good. But it's no mystic pizza. And it isn't the only pizza place around. This story has a happy ending though. We went to Dewey's, were promptly seated, experienced the best service there, as we always do, and left with full bellies, probably way before we would've even gotten our pizza at Pi. Never again.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"My husband and I usually go to the BJs in Sparks and after last night I remember why. The service at the south Reno location is pretty laughable. The host staff were friendly and prompt, but when we got to our table, we didn't see the waitress for a while. She also introduced herself under a different name than the host did, which we assumed to be an honest mistake until later when the bill arrived and the host did have the correct name, and the server gave us the wrong one. We ordered beers, and my husband recently lost his ID, so he used his passport to verify age. The server did not know how to read the passport to find his date of birth and said she needed to take it 'to the back'. For anyone who has traveled, myself included, this sent up a huge red flag. It is incredibly unorthodox to take someone's passport out of their sight for any reason. So for the 10 minutes it took her to return to our table with the beer, we were uneasy to say the least. Upon her return, I asked why she needed to take it to the back because it seemed like an odd practice, and at this point I was still chalking it up to her being young and just not knowing better. She replied in a very rude tone \"I'm allowed to take it from you\" and then told us the manager had to verify it. This makes no sense to me for two reasons. 1. You are carding someone to verify their age, so a passport should suffice, it says their date of birth just like a driver's license. 2. I highly doubt the manager has any kind of scanner or training to verify that a passport is valid. I have worked at many restaurants and even if this was such a practice, then the manager should come to the table to see the passport, not take it from the patron for a long time \"to the back\" with no explanation or other option. Following her snap at me, the rest of the meal was awkward to say the least. It took us another 15 minutes to order the food because she wouldn't come back to the table, and when she did she would only address my husband, ignoring me for daring to ask a question. Her attitude put a damper on the entire evening and we won't be going back to that location.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Wow. What a big disappointment! I'm always excited to try newly found places and give them a go. Groupon offered an opportunity to visit so we took the offer and headed out. I was really surprised as we pulled up. Visually, it made me wonder if we were at the right place. Eclectic comes to mind, but I can't even say it really encompassed that in a good way. It had the impression of a flea market upon first glimpse from the outside. When you approach the front door, the first thing you see is a hand written sign about GROUPONS! And it made me feel like that must be the main focus of their endeavors, folks with Groupons. We were there on a Sunday afternoon around 5. We were seated shortly after arriving. The waitress was friendly and accommodating, brought water and took drink orders and returned with them quickly. I had a glass of the Ruffino Chianti, $7. Moderately priced, and fair for what a glass of wine costs most places. The bread they bring to the table - AMAZING. It really is great bread. Perfectly golden, and a crunchy outside, with a great soft textured bread inside. Very warm, borderline hot! Awesome. Surprised there was no olive oil for dipping, and instead--foil wrapped pats of butter. I ordered the FETTUCCINE GORGONZOLA. It comes with a salad too. My salad was drowning in the Balsamic Vinegar dressing. Seriously, there was a pool of it on my plate that I also, dipped my bread in after I stopped eating the drenched iceberg lettuce. One small grape tomato on the whole salad. After a few bites I stopped eating this very forgettable salad. The main dish ($16): A perfect portion of al denta fettuccine pasta, in a very creamy gorgonzola sauce. Piping hot! The disappointment was that was all there was in it. I tasted no garlic whatsoever, there was no cracked black pepper in it either. It became really, a glorified plate of mac and cheese in a way. I realize some recipe's simply call for a basic cream sauce, sans the pepper, garlic and other possible tasteful additions, but this one was very bland regardless. My friend ordered the Seafood Penne ($18). It was also a good portion size, not too much, not too little. The penne was cooked al dente as you would expect. The flavor of the dish was actually pretty good. It had four or five salad shrimp tossed in, as well as what I thought were half dozen bay scallops--however, they were actually bits of white fish, not bay scallops. The downside ... was that the sauce was a soup consistency! It was SO runny! My friend literally used a pasta spoon for some of the meal to get the sauce with the penne into his mouth. (I know, right?) It was the only way to do it. He also used the bread to sop up the flavorful, yet very runny \"caper sauce\". The women's restroom, was creepy.

On one particular Saturday I showed up early (9:30p) because I had gotten back from a trip earlier than expected. At the entrance, bouncer said its a $10 cover at 10p. We mentioned that its currently 9:30p so why would we have to pay a cover now? His response: \"I don't set the prices,\" and still demanded the cover charge 30 minutes early. Whatever.

{"text":"Had a spur of the moment dinner last night with a friend from Indiana who is in town and misses Basque food (he grew up here). We met at LBC at 7pm and were seated along with several groups including a birthday group with an eighty year-old guest of honor. Bread & butter and house wine was laid before us and before long the soup of the day: split pea. It was delicious! Memories of Anderson's down the coast in CA but less smokey and with more chunks of ham, I thoroughly enjoyed this homemade concoction. The first course was beef tongue. I love that at LBC you get to try things that you may normally be a bit squeamish about, but know in your heart that it will be prepared the best it could possibly be. The tongue was a prime example of this. Simmered low and slow for hours alongside peppers and onions, it was a phenomena on its own. I've had lengua street tacos- I remember how tender they were- but I had never experienced tongue otherwise, and every bite made me very happy. For the main course their special that night was shrimp in a garlic cream sauce and I chose that while my friend chose lamb. He thoroughly enjoyed his- so glad to be back among the familiar Reno tastes he grew up with. My shrimp was excellent if a little overcooked . Large, plump shrimp, a bit tough, but fresh and in a nice sauce. Good but I wavered over a 5 star rating. However the excellence of the tongue, the soup, the salad mixed with the beans, and the great service and unrushed atmosphere boosts it back up to a \"5\". I finished off the tongue from the family style plate, had a little ice cream, and was very satisfied with my meal, the conversation, and especially the gem that sits down on Fourth Street. We are lucky in so many ways in Reno, culinary-wise... I know, having lived in many different locales around the country. I still crave slaw dogs from South GA, teriyaki stands from the NW, Cuban food from Miami, Trini food from Trinidad, and until recently (thank you Robertos), San Diego style taco shops.

The band that was performing so happened to be covering the Eagles which only made my meal better! I skimmed the menu and saw a variety of tasty bites I would have loved to indulge in but I was there for a burger so to the burger section I came to. I ended up with the \"Big Pete's Burger\" with \"Onion Straws\" and \"Shoe-string fries\" to share. What a delicious and satisfying plate of carbs, fats and oils. It was so much food I had to (with much mockery from my friend) take off my hamburger bun so I would have enough room for the fries and onion straws. My burger was cooked rare to my request and was very juicy and tasty. The fries and onion straws were fried to perfection and I believe not a crumb was left. To be honest the service was a little slow but the food made up for it. You get a lot for your money's worth at Pete's! Will be back again!","stars":4.0}

Love the open kitchen area, from the door way you can watch them make almost everything. Food Appetizer - I have never tried this for breakfast. Main Course - Started with a fresh squeezed orange juice, nothing compares to something this fresh, simply and divine. I went with one of the daily specials, Frank's \"Spicy\" Omelet. And yes they had quotes around the word spicy. The omelet was huge with tons of flavor. The jalapenos and jalapeno cheese did not over power the taste of the other items in the omelet. It is also served with a side of hash browns, a slice of wheat toast and sour dough. That sour dough was so crunchy and lightly browned. I wonder how they do that. Dessert - you kidding after that huge of an omelet. Service - It was just perfect.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The food was okay. We choose this place because there was a Yelp deal $20 for $30. The deal was incorrectly applied to the final cost of our meal. We only had $20 subtracted from the total cost of our meal instead of $30. So ultimately we did not save anything and paid full price in the end. The waitor did not correctly apply our Yelp deal. It was too late and not worth the hassle once we realized it. There was a nice ambiance to the place. The cheaper meals were really basic and you had to pay extra for things you wanted to add on.","stars":3.0}

I called ahead to see if they had any specials, and Emanual said not to worry and just come in and ask for him! So we did. He happily gave us complimentary drinks and chips and salsa! Atmosphere: VERY casual. This is clearly a place where families can come and have a relaxing meal with children. You can also come without kids, but that just shows you the kind of family-friendly environment this place is. The table next to us had 2 kids, and the kids meals came in frisbees as plates. The waitress cleaned both with a disinfectant wipe at the end of the meal and gave them to the kids to play with. THAT is truly AMAZING service. You have to order at the front and sit yourself, but food comes out to your table. Its a blend of fast-cas and restaurant service. Food: We had the chips and salsa, nachos, and the corn. All three were great, salsas were differently and delicious. The portions were HUGE. Definitely order 1 entree between two people with a side of something else. Drinks: Their soda machine has soda made with cane sugar. It was interesting, I am not used to the taste so I still prefer a coke or pepsi with corn syrup haha. Service: Great service, quick, efficient. Very friendly staff all around! Pro tip: portions are huge, so maybe start with fewer things and order more as you need. Pro tip #2: ask if there are specials during the week!","stars":5.0}

And who wants to get under a car in the HOT desert? What's not to like? COST. A 5-star rating gets kicked down to 2, because of very high cost. A trip to Jiffy Lube had cost approx $28. With the advent of synthetics (I'm a believer) the oil is much more expensive... but not that expensive. Now a trip to JL cost $85 and that with a $10 discount! In addition to heightened cost of the Platinum 0W-20 at $40 and a filter for $10, I am charged a $40 ($39.99) \"Signature Service\" charge. So, where is the customer value proposition for about 3x the cost for only twice the distance? In another words, the synthetic route at JL will cost you much more than the extra miles you might gain. The Signature Service charge at $40 is simply too high. I'll will buy the same Penn oil for $25 at Walmart and a filter for $6 and pay $10 for a hoist charge at a local auto hobby shop (TOTAL $41) - until - Jiffy Lube gets smarter about the Signature Service charge.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Two years after my first excursion and more sandwiches than I'd care to admit later, Paesano's still stands among my favorite places to eat in the city. The proportions of bread, condiments, and meats are all in perfect harmony, and the quality of the ingredients truly shines. These are not sandwiches for the faint of heart, with eclectic, indulgent ingredients including roast suckling pig, fried chicken livers, and lasagna. However, they're made with love and a lot of thought. And at under $10 a pop for gourmet sandwiches that will leave you comatose, an absolute steal. By the way, vegheads, fret not. Two very solid (comparable in quality to the carnivorous offerings) options are yours for the taking. All that can be said of Paesano's has probably been said more skillfully than I could. Still, if you're going to take an out of town guest to a place that exemplifies the Philly ethos, this is it. Unpretentious, full of character, and nourishing, Paesano's is a delicious reflection of our city's attitudes and tastes.

My girlfriend and I went on what appeared to be a calmer afternoon. They only drawback to this place, is that for 3 pieces at 11.00 (close to a full pizza), a little bit more freshness could be reasonably expected. Most of the pizzas looked like they had been waiting on the racks for quite some time. Perhaps this problem could be remedied by coming at a busier time, but fresh pizza should not be unreasonable at such a price. Overall, still tasted great, outdoor seating was nice, and staff was friendly, just wish they did not overstock so heavily on the pizza which then results in so many pies left to dry in the air.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Bobby Flay is huge, he is the superstar of the food world. Putting his name on something as iconic and American as a burger is brave. Unfortunately, this place did not deliver. While service was decent and the restaurant layout is fun, the food itself was subpar. I ordered a Dallas burger and my niece had a brunch burger. We also had fries and onion rings. Let's start with the goods. The sauces offered at the table was pretty delicious. There's chipotle ketchup, jalape\u00f1o sauce, and burger sauce along with your standard ketchup and mustard. The burger patty itself is very juicy and cooked perfectly. The rest, is bad. There was not enough distinctively flavors to define the burgers. My Dallas burger came with coleslaw and BBQ sauce and Monterey Jack cheese. When I bite into it, all I could taste was cheese and pickles. There was nothing BBQ or Dallas about it. The brunch burger faired a bit better with the sunny side up egg and smoked bacon. It's good but again, not spectacular. The burgers here are on par with Red Robin's maybe but definitely not anything more than that. Also, the burgers are tiny, it caught me off guard how small the portions are for the price. The fries and onion rings are the worst. The fries are extremely soggy. Imagine buying fries and then walking in the rain, that's how the textures were. The onion ring was not much better. The deep fried flour was falling apart and I'm eating onions and broken fried dough separately. Also, the onions inside was almost burned while the outside is under cooked, tell me how that's possible? Overall, the burgers are Ok and everything else is bad. The place would have had a 3 if they didn't associate with iron chef Bobbly Flay. With the way it is, a two star is quite generous.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I love coming here for live music. They book some great acts and there is never a cover charge. I can't say anything about the food, having never ordered any, but they always have a ton of great beer on tap, listed on the walls. The bands play in a wide open space with plenty of tall tables and chairs, a pool table in the back, and bench seating along the wall. As for the beer: Coffee Stout is good, strong, dark, and will give you coffee breath. Vanilla Milk Stout is dark, mild and creamy. Raspberry Dortmunder is sweet and light, kind of tastes like torani syrup in a beer. The Cider is very sweet and sour and really tastes like apple juice, with beer in it. If you love carbonated dry ciders, like Woodchuck, this is not what you normally drink. It's basically apple wine. (I'm starting to wonder if they just brew their beer and then add other liquids.) The bartenders back by the music area are awesome, nice, friendly and efficient. They never leave you standing around unnoticed. They are constantly on the move, and constantly moving through the room collecting empty glasses so the tables never get cluttered. The parking lot is big, which is a plus because this place gets crowded.","stars":5.0}

The host actually sat another table of three ahead of us which we weren't to thrilled about and we asked him why that was? He said it was a mistake and apologized. Let's be serious here u read names from a list. If u can't do that correctly get another system. The service besides the host was very good. The waitress fulfilled any request in a timely manner. Our food was quick and it was definitely worth the wait. Probably one of the best breakfast places I've been to. The menu had many choices and I tried the sausage biscuit w\/gravy topped with 1 egg. It was delicious . I was skeptical at first bc I thought the biscuit were like a home style biscuit but I believe they were cornmeal biscuit. After first bite I thought amazing. The way it was presented was nice to. Didn't look like slip on a plate, the biscuits were sliced nice and layers on plate so middle only has gravy. If our experience with host wasn't so annoying I would've gave five stars but when there's two hosts and neither of them can read names in order that's a problem. I'll definitely go back again though. Highly recommend.","stars":4.0}

While we were there he cooked Gumbo, Jambalaya and pralines. Each day they have different things they cook so check their website. You then get small portions of the food, but he offered seconds to anyone if they came up for more. At this point we had been in New Orleans for five days trying local restaurants, but this was definitely the best by far and we watched the whole process which was amazing. This is something you must do in New Orleans. They give you the recipes and pens to take notes as they go along too. Plus the tables include a sampling of their own spices.

My salad was comprised of the equivalent of two leaves of romaine chopped up with a little chicken thrown on top with a teaspoon of chopped tomatoes. Definitely not worth it.

{"text":"My friend and I sat down at 11am, ordered water and then eggs benedict. Our water came immediately, however, it took 30 minutes for us to get our food. Our waitress (Rhiannon) didn't come back to our table for that entire time period so I had to wave down another server and ask where our meals were. Another 15 minutes and we received them. I wanted to ask for maple syrup, but, Rhiannon still hadn't returned at that point. I waved down another server again and asked for syrup, and the bill, because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for the bill. Now it's 11:45, and we're finished eating, and I've talked to both servers about the fact our original waitress hasn't returned, asked us how everything is, or anything. Rhiannon walked past us many times but never stopped at our table. No one responded or cared about my concerns, no one did anything, so we just sat there waiting to pay. A server came with the debit machine but we hadn't even received our paper bill yet. (Lack of communication all around.) I overheard two other tables voice their concerns with the lack of service and bad quality of food, so I wasn't the only unhappy customer this morning. Finally we got our bill. We paid at 12:10pm and left. I'm deeply disappointed. I've been to the restaurant when it's a lively Friday night and the tables are absolutely packed, and the service was BETTER then. There was really no reason for the service to be so terrible as it was today. It didn't look like there was a supervisor or manager on duty, and it wouldn't really matter to because when I voiced my concerns to both servers, nothing came of it. Was this worth it for two tiny eggs and a handful of tater tots? No. Not at all.

I admit though I should have paid attention to the sign about not putting your finger through the cage (I didn't think a 1 eyed dog even a pit bull would bite me!). Anyway not a big deal being that it was my fault. 2. I offered to foster an old dog who is going blind and on medication, but they turned me down. It's sad but I don't think most people would adopt a dog who is old, going blind, and on medication (I would foster but not adopt it). 3. Not as many dogs as the HS and most are pit bulls. 4. Not as many promotions going as the HS 5. Price on purebred dogs is $200 (many rescues are cheaper) 6. I was PISSED that on the day that they let the dogs swim at the park that they didn't mention on their website that the shelter would be closed! A staff member tried seeing if her coworker would let me just view the dogs but I was turned away after making a special trip. Many other cars were in and out of the parking lot due to their website not saying it would be closed that day. That being said this place is still worthy of 4 stars... 1. Very clean kennels with a fair amount of space. 2. No kill of course (the HS is the same in that respect but they do put down sick animals or ones that they feel are too aggressive to \"make it\" which I understand even as a dog lover) 3. Although pricier than the HS 4. Pricing on medium\/large NON pure breed dogs are just $10 more than at the HS when the HS is not running a promotion. 5. Good prices on vaccines I probably will end up at some point finding a dog at the HS just because they offer more dogs. Each time I have been to the SPCA it is usually the same dogs =( Will happily continue to support the SPCA though however I can!","stars":4.0}

Literally yelled at, as if I was supposed to know already and sounding out her words WE.. DON'T.. HAVE.. THAT as if I was a child. Every other experience I've ever had here was a bad one. One other time I came through the drive thru I ordered some items and a medium coke. The girl rang it up as a diet coke. I told her I'm sorry that is supposed to be a coke, apologizing although I know she made a mistake. She had the nerve to say to me \"no you said diet coke\"... I know for a fact I didn't, and why would I say diet coke if I wanted a coke? Even if I did that was not the way she should have handled it. Just change it, don't argue with me. I've done all of their jobs before when I worked at Wendy's for 3 years as a teenager, and would never have treated someone that way. Although I do understand the frustration of customers taking too long, making you void items, etc. I can't imagine treating another human being the way they do every time I come there.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I went to LensCrafters in Langhorne to see about getting my 10 year old son a new pair of glasses and mine adjusted. I had both my boys (4 and 10) and my mother who was in a wheelchair. I was semi greeted by the gentleman. I explained to him I was looking for a new pair of glasses for my son. He looked up some information in the computer and then asked me if I wanted the prescription from last year (in a condescending tone) which I replied yes. I mentioned we might use the keystone first insurance my children have and his snotty reply was \"we don't except keystone first\". As if is a lower class insurance. This is when I noticed both my kids playing with their sample lenses. I grab the lenses out of their hands and put them back. I took my 10 year old over to the kids glasses and started trying to help him. My mom in her wheelchair was trying to help keep the 4 year old in check while looking for herself. After we concluded there was nothing their my oldest would like we decided to wait. I turned around and noticed the same associate not vigorously cleaning the sample lenses my kids were touching. I figured okay makes sense since my kids just figured them up. I asked if he could adjust my son glasses. He seemed annoyed but then did so. When he went back behind the counter and my back was turned he then very rudely said \"can you please...there are not toys\". When I turned back around I saw my 4 year old playing with the sample lenses again. I took them out of his hands and put them back. I get my kids were in the wrong but considering I was a person who was trying to accomplish a task with a disabled adult and two kids the attitude I received from this associate was unnecessary. Clearly I was trying to give my 10 year old my attention while keeping my 4 year old in check and help my mother at the same time. I know those sample lenses are not toys!! The fact that the kids were in the building seemed to irritate this gentlemen. This is also not the first time I have experienced this same pretentious attitude from this associate. I work in customer service and I get it, some days just are bad. However, this is unnecessary and made me feel as if my kids were unwelcomed. So much so I almost forgot to get my own glasses adjusted. This was it for me. I, my husband and both my kids wear glasses. My husband and I both get them from this location however I think is is time for a change. I will be taking my business elsewhere.

{"text":"Our second time here. First time (over a year ago 2015) was amazing! So our first night back in SB and we had to check it off the list. Quick disclaimer: all you Yelpers who give a negative review of any establishment please do everyone a favor, if you know of an alternative spot to go to... list it! Now on to my review. The Lucky Penny did not disappoint. Actually (reading current reviews) I was a little worried, first there were a slew of reviews that complained about wait to order ratio. First off, when are you showing up, during peak hours? Hate to break the news, but you're always going to wait a long time for food during \"rush hour.\" We showed up on a Tuesday at 8:30PM and had our order in front of us piping hot 10 minutes later. I was shocked actually because (per your \"horrible\" reviews) a few of you had to wait 45min\/1 hour after ordering (that's on you, not the Lucky Penny) clearly you showed up when everyone else did. Pizzas ordered: The Lucky Margherita, The Black + Green, The LP Kids (shared easily with two children) and a Muffaletta sandwich. A couple of beers and some lemonades. My short and sweat review of the food: F'N AMAZING! 5 STARS for food taste\/speed\/quality! Now all you clowns that bash the food quality of the Lucky Penny... I don't know what planet you're from but if you don't like the Lucky Penny... then you were born addicted to crack. And get out of here with your snobby reviews, cause you suck at life. Side note: And to the recent \"clearly Asian\" (you said it, not me) reviewer who bitched about not being able to sit in a not open adjacent restaurant, seriously, nobody was being racist... The only racist was you, who was so quick to throw that card out. Just because it was there and not being used - is bad form and a slippery slope to start using another establishments space for your spoiled self entitlement. So please remove that silver spoon that is clearly shoved up where the sun doesn't shine... and enjoy life a little bit less racist in the future. Wait staff were super polite and more than helpful. Taking into consideration we showed up 30min prior to closing, anyone in the service industry - (a long time ago in a former life I was once one of you) - knows that 30min till closing means \"we closed five minutes ago!\" That's my opinion anyway. The guy behind the counter took our order with a smile and was more than accommodating. 5 STARS for service! I never give anyplace a five star review... The Lucky Penny is my first!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"To describe my enthusiasm for The Aroma Club, I'll start with the summer borscht. Normally, I hate cold soup. I haven't had a gazpacho I like, for instance. At The Aroma Club, the summer borscht has a purple broth and wonderful fresh beet flavor. With too many borschts the fresh beet flavor gets cooked right out. One member of the group liked it so much she's ordering it to feed 75 at her son's wedding reception this summer. And they have other interesting takes on Russian\/Slavic dishes and from places like Georgia and Uzbekistan. I got to try these during the semi-annual Russian Food Festival and again during a Greater Reno Grub and Gripe Group dinner. Everyone agreed the food was exquisite and different. I liked almost all the dishes but I think for my two favorites I will go with the mushroom appetizer and with satsivi chicken, or chicken in a thick walnut paste. Sadly I didn't get any details on the mushrooms used in the appetizer or the method of preparation, but I'm a sucker for mushrooms and these delivered the mushroom flavor. I'd say look at my photo. The satsivi chicken is served cold. It is coated with a heavy, delicious paste of ground walnuts. Again very nice flavors. Two dishes that rotate in and out of The Aroma Club menu also showed up at our GRGAGG dinner. The stuffed cabbage was delicious. It had a nice tomato sauce on the outside and tender cabbage. The stuffing was a bit softer than the stuffed cabbage my mom used to make but was quite delicious. We also had pelmeni, a dumpling supposedly introduced to the Russians by the Mongols. It's a cousin to Chinese dumplings. It seems like they're cooked in a soup but served without the soup. The dough was tasty and the meat filling, I think pork, was also tasty. We all got a half of a chiburekki or chiburek, a fried meat turnover. This does not rotate on the regular menu but shows up at the Russian Food Festival and special dinners. It was nicely done with nicely seasoned meat and perfectly cooked crust. The Russian potato salad is a good take on regular potato salad. The eggplant appetizer tasted great when served on their rye bread. I also loved the house-made farmer's cheese. We got it as an appetizer and again at the end in a blintz served with a semi-sweet blueberry compote. At the GRGAGG meal everyone was happily stuff. The way The Aroma Club normally works is that the owner will make a batch of food, saying stuffed cabbage, and sell that until it runs out. Then she will make a batch of something else. In winter she seems to rotate among borscht, lentil soup and sometimes sorrel soup. The owner opened The Aroma Club as a perfume store and coffee shop about nine years ago. She still sells specialty perfumes but the focus of her store behind Round Table Pizza in Reno Town Mall is food. One of our group members proclaimed an","stars":5.0}

Not only that but they are not pescatarian friendly, everything they had on the menu is cooked up with some type of meat. I ordered the herb crusted salmon and it wasn't the best, plus they forgot to change the dressing that had meat in it, therefore, I had to wait a few extra minutes. Not one person that I went with was satisfied with their food. If you like the food to be over battered and don't mind the lack of options in seafood, then this is the place for you.

{"text":"It's the same Cunningham. They've turned what was once an eclectic and colorful collection of independent establishments known for their personality and culture into yet another suburb strip of American staple dishes washed with the same \"gourmet\" brush, using just enough garnish to justify the increased cost to consumers. I'm not saying the food isn't good, I'm not saying the service isn't the typical \"that's just how hip places are\" attitude people seem to love, and I'm not saying it won't make Cunningham or the city a good sum of money. When you put Tavern at the Point in a nearly literal lineup with the rest of Cunningham's collection, they begin to run together. It can't be called a chain because each one has its own theme and corner of the world it pretends to hail from, but in every way that matters, they're identical. In the last several years, Mass Ave has all but lost the unique blend of personalities that made it such an attractive part of town to begin with. It's no longer 45 degrees from anything. It's just as parallel and universally ordinary as anywhere else. I give it a 3\/5 because it's the definition of ordinary. If I could give it a 2.5\/5, I would. So, for Tavern at the Points, go pay a little too much for exactly what you expect. And don't forget to pick up your rewards card because at a 1:10 ratio you can tell exactly how much money you've given the same guy.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I swore I'd reviewed Camp Bow Wow Tucson when we first moved to Tucson about 10 months ago, but I can't find my previous review. Suffice it to say I have been a happy, loyal customer ever since the first visit. I really liked that they do an assessment first, but since it's been many day care visits and a few boarding visits by this point, I will reiterate that it's so great to not only receive an exemplary level of service from such a great, caring staff, but also to feel so welcomed and a part of the business and this area. Of course, the most important thing is how the dogs are treated, and they are treated extremely well. We have three dogs in the 65-70 pound range and they're not the most well behaved dogs in the world, The caregivers\/guardians are skilled in both canine and human socialization (ha!). Seriously, though, the dogs react to them so well, and they have great customer service skills as well. Sometimes when we drive up, they see our car and they are ready and waiting for us. They're really sweet and caring and just take great care of the dogs. They really handle communication so well (tell you how the dogs did). And that goes not just for the staff - the caregivers\/guardians and the desk staff (Valerye in particular, but also Crystal and Chuck (I really like Chuck too)) - but especially for Linda, the OUTSTANDING manager (but more on her in a minute). They also manage to handle check in and check out really efficiently. When we lived in Kansas, our local doggie daycare\/boarding facility was not the fastest at check-in or check out(we really liked that place as well but to be honest, it was a time consuming process to check in for boarding and sometimes even for day care). But Camp Bow Wow Tucson is ALL OVER IT, MAN! You walk in and BOOM, they're ready for you. And if they're not instantly ready, it will be a minute or two and that's all. And when you come to pick them up, same deal, they're ready to go, it's easy to pay. And they have easy to understand pricing with no stupid add-ons like some other places. And the groomers do a great job as well. I love the convenience of having their nails trimmed while at day care. A couple of additional notes. First, I mentioned how great Linda, the manager, is. She handles communication really well, sometimes she will call me if I make an online inquiry or if the staff member I initially speak with feels it's something Linda needs to handle. And when that does happen, Linda calls promptly and expresses herself clearly, answers my questions, and makes me feel welcomed and my business appreciated.

I choose the chicken Panang with coconut milk. And oh my word! This is one of the best Panangs I've ever tasted! You get a lot for portion size with a side of rice. It bursted with flavor! For the food alone, I would return for takeout. Why they got a three is because of the cleanliness of the facility. The tables and floor were decent. Problem comes when I was putting the lid back on my left overs when I noticed a baby cockroach crawling around on the rim.

Each burger came with onions, lettuce, garlic pickles, tomatoes, divine sauce, and quality ground beef. We asked to have the burger cooked medium well and well done. The well done burger still had pink in the middle. Their regular fries are very crispy. The buffalo ranch fries were soggy from the sauce and they tasted like eating buffalo wings. This fine establishment serves buckets of beers and soft drinks. Aside from burgers, they also have other food options such as wings, mac and cheese, and veggie choices. Overall we enjoyed our meal. Cheers!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Nice place for occassional visits but not somewhere I'd go on a regular basis. I went hoping that they'd have a large assortment of veggie\/fruit vendors. I think I counted three, maybe four total. The rest were tents full of various restaurants offerings, along with a large variety of novelties to include rabbit hair sweaters (felt a bit sorry for the poor Angora bunny in the pen being drooled over by the pair of German Shepherds that were close by), various clothes, raw honey, nuts, fresh dried pastas, drink mixes, pet items, etc. So, while the variety may be vast, it just wasn't what I was looking for.","stars":2.0}

When I found out about Ruby Slipper, I was more than excited to go! They easily accommodated our large group and the food was amazing! The stuffed French toast was a show-stopper. Mimosas were great and came in an abundance of varieties, although I was kind of bummed that they were not bottomless. The portions were pretty filling though. Needless to say, I would 100% recommend this place to all tourists, especially if they're looking for an impromptu brunch during the weekend.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Once again, proof that I need to get out more often. I didn't know Famous Dave's was a chain until I walked in the door. I do a fair amount of traveling, and the only other place I had seen a Famous Dave's was in Yuma. So I figured it was a \"local\" kind of chain at most. But no, it's a fairly big national brand. I still don't really like reviewing chains, but we'll invoke the \"road trip\" rule and write one up anyway. Service: 4\/5 Wow were they slammed. We came in about 7:30 on a Saturday and the wait was 45 minutes for a table for two. That said, they did a pretty good job of moving people in and out as quickly as they could under the circumstances. We were quoted 35 minutes when we put our names down, and we were seated in about that time. The service was a bit slow, especially when it came time to pay the bill at the end of the meal. And if you've read many of my reviews, you'll know that it one thing that is guaranteed to get you a star deduction. Aside from that, no specific complaints about the service. Food: 4\/5 The food we ordered ran the gamut from \"solid\" to \"spectacular.\" We started with their salmon spread appetizer. I thought it was a little out of place on the menu of a BBQ place, but boy was it good. Think of it as the \"diamond in the rough.\" Our entrees were good but not great. My wife ordered the pulled pork, a favorite of her's. I ordered a combo plate with rib tips and smoked sausage. The tips were a little tough for me, and the sausage not that flavorful. But boy do you get your money's worth in terms of food. My platter was HUGE. On top of the two meats, I got two sides, a corn cob, and a cornbread muffin. There is no doubt you will get your money's worth when you eat at Dave's. For dessert we split a bread pudding, supposedly their specialty. Like the entrees, it was good but not great. However, I was inspired to create my own bread pudding the next day, to see if I could do it better. Long story short, mine is better. Overall Impressions: 4\/5 The decor and atmosphere works well for a BBQ restaurant. It was awfully loud, but that's because it was awfully busy. As I noted above, Dave's definitely ranks well in the \"bang for the buck\" category. The portions are huge and well priced for what you get. The only thing I suppose I would suggest is don't plan on going on a Friday or Saturday night unless you fancy a long wait.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"This is one of two of my fav Indian restaurants in SB (the other one is Flavor of India). I usually go for the lunch buffet (8.95 and yes even open on sundays). They typically have salad, rice, samosas or pakomas? (the vege ones), lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, lentils, spinach, aloo gobi or eggplant. Spice has a bigger selection than Flavor of India's lunch buffet. And for dessert watermelon and rice pudding (which is the best in SB, but not the best I've had). You also get a choice of original naan bread or garlic naan yummy. The owners are really nice. Sometimes the servers are slow on refilling drinks. The decor is really lovely inside and they have outside seating to semi look out onto State street. Parking usually costs money since we're on State street or you can park in 75 minute space. Overall, I love Spice Avenue and think its the best Indian food on State Street.","stars":4.0}

And a lot of crispi(good)ness to boot. Chicken was juicy and tender (the white meat pieces are boneless - another bonus). Workers = A+. It was hot...I was cranky and they were really nice. Coleslaw was deliciously good, plus it looked pretty since the bit of red cabbage made the dressing look pink. In a no-wonder-why-most-Americans-are-obese sort've way I was a bit disappointed that the servings seemed a bit small BUT I was totally full from my two piece + small side and anything else would've just been gluttonous.

He mentioned that they cleaned the windows, no. I didn't request window cleaning and most importantly they didn't clean the windows. We finally agreed on $280, with an additional $5 charge if I used my credit card. I said no, he then waived the charge. We were thinking about using their service about once a week, they can now kiss that goodbye. Again, the ladies did a good job, but Jordan was unprofessional and deceitful.

No one there at the company bothered to check before shipping out. Went through claims process again. 4.

{"text":"Just meh. Everyone has probably experienced better. Nothing to write home about at all. Last month I flew when US Airways took passengers stranded already (thankfully) and delayed from another airline. They have agreements and such with other airlines but yet then have no empathy when people are moved last minute to a flight they have waited hours for another, have schlepped across the airport, no longer have seats they worked hard to get etc. The terminal US Air employees, were little help when we had single seats all over the plane. We asked multiple employees too. Most acted like you were bothering them but they were on duty. The only one that would look at it ended up putting kids in exit rows only to have to have us go back to have them moved again as they were in a nonallowed row and still sitting alone. Then after multiple attempts someone understood and fixed it so kids were in another row together and not alone. The gates were older and no outlets to be had. The employees don't seem to care and just talked amongst themselves and other than the boarding pass taker were not very friendly to anyone really. On the flight the attendants we're not much nicer. One older woman head flight attendant chastised people for using the front bathroom when carts blocked the bathroom for hundreds. She knew that was the case but had to make an announcement following a little girl going when she told her mom she couldn't hold it. That Flight attendent's words on the loudspeaker really were rude. The other flight attendants did their job but no friendliness, warmth, chit chat. Food for purchase was ok but expensive. The bags made it (a benefit). Overall, flying isn't what it used to be.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I've been to New Orleans 5 times and now live here and am embarrassed to say that I had never had an official Po Boy- until today. This place did have a huge line that took about 1\/2 hour to 45 minutes to get through to the front. That was a bummer.We did try to eat inside at the bar but it was packed so we gave up and got in line. On the up side, they were selling cheap beer at the bar ($3.50\/bottle of Abita) so the beer made the line less annoying. On to the food. I had a regular size Shrimp Po Boy, Sweet Potato Fries and shared the Bread Pudding with Rum Sauce. My partner had a Fried Potato Po Boy regular size and French Fries. The Shrimp Po Boy was delicious and there were a ton of Shrimp. They kept falling out all over the place. I had the sandwich dressed which means that it has tomato, shredded iceberg lettuce , pickles and mayo. I was unsure about having the sandwich dressed as I can be a bit of a food snob and normally hate anything with iceberg lettuce on it and although I like pickles, I usually remove them and eat them separately as they tend to overpower a sandwich. However, for some reason this sandwich works perfectly with everything on it.I even added the pickles back in! The bread was fresh as were the shrimp and the thought ran through my head that they must change their oil often because the taste was fresh and not greasy at all. The sweet potato fries were good, cooked crisp and again not greasy. My partner's Fried Potato sandwich he said was good as well as the fries. I didn't try them, having a mountain of food to work through myself. I will say that the fries were a medium thickness and I personally prefer skinny fries. He liked them and said they were crispy outside and soft inside as they should be. We were totally pigging out so we also had the home made bread pudding with rum sauce to split for desert. It was really, really good! That first bite was sweet and savory and still a little warm (because we had ordered it at the same time as the sandwiches given the long lines!). It had raisins in it and the sauce really made the desert. It had a hint of vanilla and cinnamon. I do have to say that the quantity of food won the battle. Neither of us could finish our fries or the desert (and I hate leaving desert uneaten!). Next time we go back (and I think we will!) I would get the regular size sandwich again and the desert. The fries, although good, were just too much food!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Truffles Ambiance: Wine room looked to have stacked boxes and unkept. Perhaps it was due to the holidays? Otherwise, it was a very cozy atmosphere with very friendly staff. They weren't overbearing and they took their time presenting their menu since we informed them that this was our first time dining at Truffles. Eats: Out of all the dishes we ordered, the roasted bone marrow took the cake. We already knew what to expect, since we regularly cook bone-in curries with lamb shank, so the main difference was the method of execution. LOVE LOVE LOVE it! My 7yo son loved it as well! Only problem was there wasn't enough!!! Escargot was the other dish that really made me love snails that much more...the fluffy pastry was a delight to experience! I was able to distinguish each fillo dough layer. It reminds me of fresh baked baklava. Quite a bit of attention is required in order to have that sort of texture! The savoriness of the escargot was on point too, although it wouldn't have hurt to have either capers or lemon to cut the rich flavor. For what many consider the trademark dish, truffle fries, I'd like to note the emphasis on the 'truffle'...they coated the fries with truffles, almost too much. The truffles have a great flavor, but it is easy to get overzealous on the dusting and complete overpower the reason why we like fries in the first place. The trout topped with crab wasn't really extraordinary; the fish was slightly dry, but then again, the piece of fish wasn't that big to begin with. As far as the crab is concerned, it was executed as if it was an afterthought. Don't get me wrong, it's a great dish, however, I've definitely had better with the moisture content in the fish, as well as a balance on the palate. The smoked duck was well-executed. The cheese-bread was a bit on the heavy side though. It would have been a respectable nod if they had steam buns and some chives to cut the savory. That would put the dish very similar to Peking-style duck, which is an excellent dish. I understand this is the chef's interpretation, so we leave it to the chef for modifications. Conclusion: The ongoing theme for all of these dishes were quite savory and heavy. I was really surprised that there wasn't a break in all of this within the menu, or even within a dish itself. When we reviewed the desserts, there wasn't anything particularly impressive...even the dessert wines were a bit heavy. We are definitely fans of the bone marrow and escargot! It is a bit of a hidden gem, so there's much to be said about a place off the beaten path and still be packed! Thank you for the experience, Thank you, Chef Brandon and staff!","stars":4.0}

The food is good, we ordered the chicken parm (which comes with spaghetti with tomato sauce AND a house salad), and the cutlets are cut smallish, but there are four pieces so it's probably the same size as two larger cutlers. In addition, we got a greek salad, which was big and the Italian vinaigrette to go with it, which was super tasty. We also ordered a large cheese pizza, the sauce to cheese ratio was very complementary. If I lived in the area, I'd order again, we're just here for the holiday weekend, but our friend we're staying with really liked it too, and he's a Domino's guy, so I'm hoping he'll change his ways and support a local business instead :)","stars":5.0}

The food is bland and I had to add salt to every dish I ate. Any dish cooked with lemon (and many are) is cooked with the lemon seeds still in, which makes it very bitter. My boyfriend ate some cheap chicken dish with bleu cheese and walnuts that was flat-out gross. When asked what was in two dishes we ordered, the wait staff didn't know. Essentially, I felt as though their chef tries too hard to be unique; the ingredients make the dishes sound delicious, but they are poorly executed. Finally, the last straw was when my cannoli was cream cheese and not ricotta, and the filling did not fill the length of the shell, but instead was a gaping hallow inside. Should I mention that they gave us those complimentary chocolate shots that everyone is talking about, but they didn't card me, my boyfriend, or my sister (who is SIXTEEN!) when they served us the alcohol?

Actually she's pretty discerning, so she's still not too psyched about the possibility of ever returning. The crab cake was not warmed throughout, and remained a little soggy.

The menu is almost identical to the one in town, but the prices are a good 15-20% lower. On top of that, there is minimal wait times here. I came here recently with a buddy who wanted to have dinner here. We came on a Thursday night and sat at a high top in the bar. We were greeted by a friendly server (I unfortunately can't remember his name) who was very attentive to our needs. We started with chargrilled oysters. They were very good. Not as filling as Dragos, which was good because we had plans to order meals. I ordered the Fish Pontchartrain. It was a large piece of fried catfish with a cream sauce with shrimp and lump crabmeat. I had steamed veggies as my side and it was quite delicious. The fish was tender and there was alot of crab and shrimp piled on top. My buddy had the grilled shrimp plate with the marinade and chargrilled oysters sauces on the side. The marinade that was suppose to be on it wasn't very tasty, but the butter sauce for the chargrilled oysters substituted quite nicely. His sweet potato fries were also really good too.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This hotel really rides the line of being ok and not actually being ok. The beds seem clean, are comfortable, and the staff are really, really nice. The location is fine - close enough to but also far enough from all the Latin Quarter drama. I'm here for a conference so I really only need a clean bed and a hot shower, and this room delivers. However, the room has some serious issues you really don't expect would be even on the radar for a hotel at this price point. For example: The toilet paper is less than 1 ply. It's a half ply. We were at the Louisiana welcome center, and the TP was more convincing in its job performance. This is the kind of TP that makes you pretty sure the management didn't want to provide TP at all, but felt compelled to do so out of cultural expectation. This is begrudgingly provided toilet paper. This is toilet paper you can see through, in Cajun food country. The cable doesn't seem to have been paid, or perhaps it's more parsimonious to say out tv may be broken. No channel comes in clear. And I'm not fancy. We are talking about like.. there's no CNN. That said, the pay-per-view channel is crystal clear. So, if you want to pay extra.. you know. Go for that. They definitely put their little \"tip the host\" card right on the broken tv's remote so you can associate those things together easily in your mind. I know it's not her fault, she's probably a super nice lady and the room is clean, but putting your card on a broken aspect of the room is just awkward. The room is REALLY noisy. And this isn't NoLa street noise (which actually isn't that bad in this location, to Its credit), this is hotel noise. I wish I could record it for this review, but I don't know how. Theres intermittent loud beeping, like and alarm, but always the same duration so it probably isn't an alarm. There's a motor sound and a clicking\/slapping sound that go on all day and all night, with no obvious machine to blame it on. It sounds like someone is slapping shoes together to get the mud out. But they're doing an entire elementary school worth after recess in the rain. There's a blowing air sound that doesn't seem associated with any obviously blowing air. There's also a tinny rattling sound that is intermittent. It's not the end of the world, but it's over 30 stories in the air and it's still really loud. If I hadn't brought noise cancelling earphones, we would have had to request a different room because it was so loud last night. So yea that's about it. As I said, it's habitable. But it's just habitable. Don't come here expecting to be overly comfortable because of the cost of it. It's not that kind of place from my experience, and there are so many really luxurious places in this city for the same price or cheaper, especially","stars":2.0}

It is definitely the biggest of the river sites. Like most of those sites, there is little grass - mostly dirt. This makes for everything getting really dirty. No biggie -it's camping. The owners were great and visible throughout our stay. Well planned and timed activities for The kids. 10am pumpkin painting, 3pm candy\/prize hunt, 7pm pie\/ice-cream social and 7:30 music show for the kids. The facilities (bathrooms, Liberty Lodge, and camp store) were very clean. My young kids were interested in trying the peddle go-carts out. The gentleman working in the office let the kids try them out first to make sure they couple operate them before we paid (the kids were not big enough). Canoes were available for rent $10 for an hour. FYI, in addition to the $10 rental , a $20 cash deposit needed to be left. Firewood was $5 a bundle. The stack of very dry wood was enormous. Better deal than any other campground I have stayed at. The playground and play area at the front of the campground was spacious and nice. With the exception of one employee we came in contact with (described below), the staff was awesome - the 2 owners, their daughter, Paul, and the older couple working in the camp store. There were a few negatives. They don't tell you until they see it, but bucket potties\/tents are not allowed. I tried explaining to the staff person (a middle aged blonde woman) that came by our site that it was for late night bathroom usage by our 8, 6, & 3 year old. She was very blunt and fairly rude about the whole thing. This was not the only time she was had a rude manner. The couple we camped there seperately asked her a question at the camp store on two different occasions. Both times they said she seemed put off and in no mood to help. In addition, it seemed as though the mini-golf could have been free or maybe a dollar per round. The course looked like it was original to the campground opening in 1992 and had not received up keep since. Would definitely recommend and stay again.","stars":4.0}

I love the Vinyasa Flow classes, and I just tried Funky Flow with Alexis which was so fun. This morning I tried Jivamukti with Libby which may have been my favorite one so far. It was fluid and challenging and the aromatherapy and singing parts were the final perfect touches. They have $5 community classes on Saturday and Sunday mornings, and make every effort to get involved with their students.

{"text":"Just returned home from a 3-night stay here to celebrate Christmas - the epitome of wonderful, gracious service from everyone we encountered during our stay (auto valet, luggage porter, reception desk staff, bartender, restaurant staff, pastry chef, coffee bar staff, doorman, housekeeping staff - and even the chief steward, whom we ran into by accident in a hallway outside the restaurant late one morning, and who was kind-enough to bring us a tray of coffee and fresh croissants to enjoy in the library when he learned we'd missed the last breakfast seating). Truly service at its best, which made our stay so enjoyable. The building itself is an old department store located on the western-most edge of the French Quarter, converted into the present Ritz-Carlton property about 20 years ago. The ambiance is elegant and understated, and the public spaces and guest rooms (including the bathrooms) feel a bit larger than other hotels deeper into the French Quarter - very nice if you desire a peaceful space to retreat to after a hectic day out & about in the city. Especially LOVE the beautiful inner courtyard, which all the public spaces on the main floor (Level 3) open onto. The location is also very convenient if you're driving in, as we were - very easy to drive down Canal Street and head right into the parking garage, vs. having to make your way through the crowded streets for any of the hotels located in the F.Q.-proper. Very walkable to all locations in the F.Q., as well - next time we want to stay in the same part of NOLA, we'll definitely be back to the Ritz!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and IT WAS AMAZING! I grew up in South Jersey (about 10 minutes from South Philadelphia) which just means that I know what Italian food is supposed to taste like. I have spent the past 6 years looking for a REAL CHEESESTEAK outside of the Delaware Valley area and I have FOUND IT. This place was exactly what I would expect walking into a little mom and pop shop in South Philly! There are only two guys there, everything is laid out for you to see before you eat it, they take the extra dough and roll it up with some garlic and call them knots, they know the difference between a calzone and a stromboli, their pizza has the proper cheese to sauce ratio so that if you tilt it while hot all the cheese will melt off. Their chees =steaks are correct, they don't resemble a poboy and they are not flavored with tony c's or another other nonsense for that matter. BREAD, CHOPPED STEAK, ONIONS, PEPPERS, CHESSE AND PLENTY OF GREASE! Just they way they should be. This is where I will go when I fwant a cheesesteak or just need some real red sauce (none of this watered down sugary nonsense that passes at most places in nola). Oh yeah, if you can't deal with this place because it isn't 'up to code' then don't bother ever going to Philadelphia let alone trying to eat at a place that will make you real pizza.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Continuing to make my way to all fifty state capitols, today's visit to the Indiana State Capitol in Indianapolis is number 36 on my quest to visit all 50 state capitols. I have a collection for the ones I've been to. Located in the heart of the city, it is similar to other capitols that look similar to the United States Capitol in Washington. Indiana was the 19th State to enter the Union, joining on December 11, 1816. This current building is the fifth structure (the fourth in Indianapolis - bonus points if you know where the first capitol was located) and was completed in 1888. It is shaped like a cross with executive branch offices on the first floor, the House of Representatives on the second floor's west east side, the State Senate on the second floor's east side and the Supreme Court offices on the second floor's north end. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Unfortunately, the building is closed to visitors at this time but you can still walk the outside. On the property, you'll find a statue of Oliver Morton (governor of Indiana during the Civil War), a statue of Thomas A Hendricks (21st Vice President of the United States under Grover Cleveland), a bust of Christopher Columbus and a statue of George Washington. Other public art structures surround the building. There is paid parking and metered street parking around the building. [Review 13515 overall, 834 of 2020.]","stars":4.0}

This particular trip we got our food before we got drinks, the biscuits were cold in the middle, the gravy had no flavor and was warm at best. Now I do not mean they biscuits were not hot, I mean they were refrigerator cold. When the waitress came by we ask if she'd forgot our drinks, she said no! She stated that they had to change out the diet Coke and then she just got busy running hot food to other guest. But she did not forget. She was clear about that. We just did not have them when the food came out?? My brother had ordered an omelette and ask for light cheese, when it arrived it was all cheese and little to no meat. Final rant, ordered my eggs over easy, they were much closer to over well. The only good thing about this trip was the young lady that seated us, she was smiling and very friendly but after that it was all downhill.

Usually when I stay in a Courtyard or Fairfield, I expect less frills, but when I book at a signature Marriott hotel, I expect better. As a frequent guest of their properties, Marriott needs to re-evaluate how they run this particular hotel: - Asked for a room with two queen beds, got a room with two full-size beds. When I inquired, they claimed it was just a \"mistake\" on the website which they had no control over. No rooms with two queen beds. (Bait and switch) - Asked about the \"full featured business center\" they advertised, and was told to go to the FedEx Office contained in the same complex. So, I got nickel-and-dimed for every copy, printout, e-mail sent, etc. (Misleading) - Asked about getting a ride to and from the airport with the complimentary 'shuttle service' they advertised, and was told they contracted with some 3rd party company which charged $10\/person, one way.

{"text":"Completely worth making the trip to Alton to check this bar out. This is simply not even close to what you would expect to find in Alton, considering most people just go there either for (1) the Alton Belle, or (2) to go to Fast Eddie's. However, add this to the list of Alton destinations, because it's a seriously, SERIOUSLY fabulous bar. The place is pretty loungy and largely caters to those craving Martinis and good food. They have a HUGE assortment of martinis as well, which is great for someone with my taste in alcohol. The drinks are all well mixed, creative, and delicious, also they don't scrimp on the alcohol, gold star for that. If you like sweet drinks, I highly suggest the Jaws....vodka, cranberry, and a sugar rim, amazing. The honey rider is incredibly rich, but if you can handle tons of chocolate and banana in your mixed drink, you just may like it. If you like your drinks tart, go for the Odd Job. It's amazing with just enough lemon to make you pucker but not so much that you need something else to wash it down. The beer menu is substantial as well, but I have not yet felt any urge to drink anything but the fancy martinis. As the food goes, I haven't had a ton of it, but what I have munched on, I did love. The Smoked Eggplant Dip is one of the most interesting and delicious appetizers I have ever eaten (and it's totally vegetarian). The Crostini with Dip is amazing as well (baked feta and pita chips), and there is a huge assortment of fish dishes that my friends have raved about. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite reasons to come to Alton, if not my favorite. You simply must check this place out.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I was very excited to finally experience berns steakhouse. The renown, fine dining experience that even Obama went to. They have done well to build a really big hype. Unfortunately it did not play out well. Walking in, the hostess was rather expressionless and un-enthused. We informed her of our reservation and she told us to step to the side and that somebody will be right with us. Ok - great, not a big deal. Now for the stellar service that we were expecting. After not being greeted for some time, our server ____ informed of us of being double-sat and offered us beverages. again, not a big deal, just not the best start. Now for the food. I was really disappointed. They bring over these little complimentary cheese crackers. Great. Then we ordered the broiled oysters and lobster bisque for an appetizer. The oysters were just under seasoned and the bisque just ok. I've had better at black rock. So when you order a steak, they will send over a soup and salad to start. They both were pretty good actually, the broth wasn't too salty as French onion typically is, and the salad tasted fresh. I ordered the chateaubriand and my husband the delmonico. Temp was spot on, but damn the steaks just needed a lot of love. No crust, no seasoning, and quite frankly, the food wasn't all that warm. The vegetables I did not touch, they didn't sing to me at all. I will give some credit due where it's deserved, the wine and liquor was not grossly overpriced which was nice. The wine selection was spectacular. They took us on a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar, which was actually really cool. That led us to the dessert room. This was the highlight of the experience and I'm afraid to say that I wish I could just rate this separate from the dinner experience. Up some stairs and into a separate hostess stand. We were seated in a private booth right in the piano room. We ordered the peanut butter torte and that was really delicious. Alas, berns for some fine wine, nibbles, and dessert? Absolutely. For dinner? Absolutely not.","stars":2.0}

While I was quoted for 3.3k, they told me they'd try anything possible to shave some $ off while still doing a stand-up job. And what an outstanding job they did, it looked NEWER after the repair than it was 2 years and 2 accidents ago when my dad first gave it to me. it cost me $400 cheaper than the originally quoted price, something that made me feel like I was a customer treated with integrity.

It had no spice at all, along with not much flavor. Meh. The tom kha soup was excellent; the veggies were cooked perfectly and it was just right!

{"text":"Cute place. It's our go-to place when we can't think of anything else to eat or do. And trust me, that's very handy because we are very indecisive! I've been here many many many times, and after a while, I have a few favorites I always order. The skewers are very reasonably priced and grilled very well, but sometimes get neglected when other dishes (udon or sashimi) come to us. We usually get the pork belly, garbi, chicken gizzards, chicken liver, and ginkos. Pork belly is very generic, so is the galbi. The gizzards texture is really good and I think they changed how they were grilling it recently, so it's even better. The chicken liver can be too watery at times, but the first 2 skewers are just great. The ginkos.. you can't really mess up on so it's quite generic. Tip: when you order skewers, order a couple at a time, so that they are still hot and fresh off the grill! You can always call your waiter over for more, when you're working on it :) I always also order the mini udon-- and we can share that among 2 people. I think they do something with the mushroom or something, because I make udon at home but it never turns out that way that they make it! It's like this special grilled taste to it that makes me always go back and get it at yakitori! Another favorite of ours is the donkatsu .. the fried pork cutlet. So I grew up eating this dish from different restaurants and even my mom cooking it for me. I would say that this donkatsu at yaki is one of the best I've ever tasted. The only other place that compares is Aki. While many other restaurants make the mistake of making the donkatsu too dry or too hard and thin, yakitori does a great job of keeping the nice moistness and still cook it all the way through. The little salad on the side is very good as well. I usually order a bowl of rice to complement my donkatsu. We also get some sashimi. We used to get the variety sorts, but after realizing we always eat the white tuna and yellowtail, we usually just order a dish of those. We also get sushi when we have more people or just want something carb-y to fill us up. The sushi is good! And I like the smaller portions since we can taste a variety of the sushi :) Drinks: As for drinks, When we order a lot of skewers and sides, we tend to get the house sake, served hot. Becareful! It's quite hot and you may need to pour the first glass with your napkin over the bottle! And we've tried many of the other sakes, but it just reminds me of korean magulli or bokbunjah and i feel like i'm getting ripped off lol. We also always order the hoegaarden on tap.

{"text":"Bad experience. Dosa Hut was my favorite Indian place, but I am sorry to day that the food quality and service had declined considerably. I went along with 5 friends, and they all felt the same way. Food arrived after 1 hour and the main course was served along with the appetizer for the entire table. On the top of that the egg biryani was cold and tasteless. The only savior was gobi manchurian, but even that was soggy and below par. Regarding the service, the server bluntly blamed the crowd. When I asked him how the table that came after us got their food before us he ignored us. When we mentioned that the biryani is cold he offered to heat it up in the microwave.","stars":1.0}

A server brought over exactly what I ordered to my table. Halfway through my meal a different server stopped by to ask if everything was okay and if I needed anything. My only slight issue was that my fries were not as hot as I would have liked them to be, however my burger was nice and hot. This location was clean with a very nice decor.

When not taking our order, she would laugh, talk and carry on with her bar customers, often yelling from one end of the bar to the other. Every head in the restaurant turned and looked at her whenever she bellowed. I could not hear my partner across the table, but I could hear that waitress - even over the already loud ambient noise. It's a shame because the food quality suggests a fine dining experience. Unfortunately, the ambient noise and that waitress suggests a hot dog\/beer concession at a ballpark. We quit half way through the meal and took the remaining food to go. Great pizza - but get it to go. We won't be dining there again.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I went last night with a high school friend who I hadn't seen in years. If it weren't for not wanting to embarrass her, I would have walked out before I even ordered. The place is tiny, like 12 tables in all, with a bar that can sit about 10 people. When I walked in it was full except for a small high-top at the bar. I grabbed that table so we would have a place ti sit. I waited literally 10 min before a server came to the table, they were obviously understaffed. He asked if I wanted anything to drink. Informing him I was going to wait for my guest he walked away. My guest arrived shortly after. I change the word server to waiter because his tone, demeanor, and lack of knowledge would have been better suited for a diner. As for the food...I had the asparagus salad, which is described as having pistachio nuts and drizzled balsamic. Neither of which is true. Well, I guess the one piece of pistachio on the salad, and the asparagus swimming in balsamic could qualify. For my main course I had a blu cheese burger. The burger was good, but the fries were the highlight of my meal, cooked and seasoned perfectly. I think I know why this restaurant is named the Wine Thief...because someone stole half of their wine list. The list they do serve is very limited, and basic. In a nutshell, this place is forgettable. If the service was any slower it would have been moving in reverse. There was a clear lack of menu knowledge. The food seems hit or miss. And what wine they serve is nothing exciting, it could be on a list at any restaurant on Germantown ave.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I wanted to love this place. My old e-cig mod died in dec 15th, and I needed a replacement, and their location and late hours were great for me and they had a wide selection. I got the Smok Priv for around $120. I was a little hesitant because it was the demo model, but I liked it enough, so I went with it. I left happy, but things went downhill fast. I wanted to get another tank like the one that came with this, and I learned that the mod and tank I just bought was discontinued over a year ago, and the price I paid was double than what it sold for when it was released. Sure, I understand that Philly taxes on this stuff is nuts, but charging double the rate for an outdated item is just shady business. I shoulda done my research first, so that was on me. I was still happy with my mod... for about a week. After about a week, I noticed the connector the tank screws into was loose. First time I just popped it back in and it was ok for a few days, but then it got looser till finally the whole thing would just spin but never unscrew. I brought it back to the shop cause it was clearly a defect. The guy behind the counter blamed me saying must have over tightened it. I've been vaping for a long time, and that's simply not the problem here, especially since I only had the device for 2 weeks. I hate writing bad reviews and I understand that small businesses are hurting in these times (which is why I went there in the first place rather than going online), this is one I warn you to stay away from. There are other local shops that won't charge double for defective outdated products and then try to blame the customer when it fails.","stars":1.0}

As a result I had zero acceleration with the car. I was able to shut off the car, turn it back on and go a little more only to have it keep faulting and losing acceleration. By the time we reached Verdi, I knew I needed help and was not going to make it back tot the Bay Area. We were stuck at the Chevron right on I-80. \"Google were are the closest auto mechanics?\" Frank's Automotive Service was the closest from where we were so I knew I was able to coast it down to them. Chris was able to get the car in and immediately run an engine diagnostics which determined the 'throttle body unit' went south. 127K+ miles something is bound to go wrong with original parts. Unfortunately, since it was late in the afternoon, Chris was unable to get the part that day. However, Chris provided options which saved time and money (i.e. Bosch make Mercedes parts, so stick with Bosch and forgo the Benz logo). Chris drove us (bags and all) to the nearest hotel, and the next morning our car was fixed. The owner Dan even picked us up in our car which gave me a strong sense of security. They both road tested the hell out of the car! We got back on the road, and the car ran great all the way home.

The coffee creamers for breakfast are supposed to be refrigerated but sit out all hours of the night and day for customers to use. If you order a meal and there is a problem with it... Don't expect it to be removed form your bill. The owners policy is \"you can't send it back if you dont like it and expect to not pay for it. You can't take food back to the grocery store once you buy it\". I'd highly recommend staying away from this place and I'm sure if you saw the walk-ins and the way food is stored unlabeled and uncovered, you would. Some of the staff are really great people that make you feel so welcomed. Horrible the way the owners take money from them at the end of every shift, tell them it's for the bus boy, and then never give it to the bus boy.

Chatters carries brands such as Pureology, Alterna, Schwarzkopf and Wella. The selection consists of shampoos, conditioners, treatments and styling products. In addition of hair care, Chatters sells hair accessories and styling tools, waxing products and nail polishes (mostly by OPI), body care and make-up. You can also get your hair cut here. The one time I used Chatters' hair cutting services, I was disappointed: the stylist ignored every request I have made and preferred to cut my hair as she herself saw fit.

{"text":"I've been a big fan of the Y Not Indian downtown in Scotia Place for a long time and the new Whyte Ave location holds up aptly with simple but fresh curries and a much more varied menu. In my 5 star rating for Y Not Indian's downtown fast food iteration, I had high praise for the robust flavours on display and fresh, flaky naan. The Whyte Ave location boasts the same great flavours, same delicious naan and same great value but with the addition of a wider variety of appetizers, tandoori mains, and stuffed naans. I didn't try the incredible mushrooms or cauliflower appetizers but they're on my to-try list for sure! As is typical for great Indian restaurants, there is a solid range of vegetarian options and traditional dishes such as the dal tarka and matar paneer are executed to perfection. Overall, Y Not Indian's expansion to Whyte ave expands on what makes the downtown location great and while there aren't many thing son this menu that you wouldn't see at any other Indian restaurant, there's definitely something to be said for simple and well-executed curries and some of the freshest naan you can find.","stars":4.0}

I first met Joyce in Nov of last year, I explained to her that I've had treatment overseas and would oile to continue. She explained how her laser is different and gave me a quote of $600 per treatment for full body. During my first treatment, I didnt feel anything, no pain of any kind. I asked her why and she said thst her machine is very advanced and she uses a gel thats why itdoesnt hurt. With Joyce looking kike shes in her 50's, i figured she must be experienced and wise. I trusted her. After two weeks of the treatment, not one hair fell out. I was surprised. Before my second treatment, I made it clear to Joyce that i dont think the her machine is working on me. She was very convincing and I went ahead and paid another $600 for the next treatment. Several weeks past after the second treatment and ZERO results! We tried to get a refund and she refused. We even asked for half a refund and she refused. I would not be so upset if her machine worked just a little bit on me. The only reason we paid for the second treatment was because we foolishly trusted her. I have fair skin and black hair; i think im an ideal canidate for laser. I found a new provider with a candela laser. Its been 10 days since my treatmet and most of the hair has already fallen off!!!!!! To add insult to injury the new provider was CHEAPER!

{"text":"Average. That's the word I keep coming back to. There are parts of this hotel that look incredibly dated, and the first impression I got walking in is that it's an old hotel. Once you get into the room it looks like the furniture is recent but the wallpaper and air conditioner are not. The bathroom is small and old but clean. The room itself is good sized. Service is a mixed bag. Some people are good at customer service, some aren't. It's the luck of the draw. The hallways aren't as clean as they should be. But the bed is comfortable and the sheets clean. Breakfast is fairly good. As is typical for a hotel it's overpriced for what you get. The restaurant staff is attentive and there's a nice view of the arch in the dining room. I ate in the lounge one night; the food wasn't bad but wasn't outstanding. The service at the bar was lacking. The bartender doted on regulars and talked to her friends but left me waiting a lot. Pro tip: self park your car. Besides the self parking being $10\/day instead of $20 for valet, the valet situation is horrid. You're recommended to call down for your car 20 minutes ahead of time. So the drive fills up with cars waiting to be claimed. Meanwhile the attendant will leave you waiting. And waiting. And waiting longer than 20 minutes. Don't bother. The rates here are cheaper than the others nearby, but the other hotels are nicer. It's not a dump, but just know that there are some trade offs for a low rate.","stars":3.0}

I ordered the Indian pancake; which is very popular and I got duck with ginger. 5 mins after I've ordered, my pancake arrived. It was very good with the compliments of the curry to go with it. It was freshly made, flakey, and easy to pull. The curry had a nice texture, good spices, and it wasnt overly spicy. Now here's where the missing star comes in. About 15 - 20 mins later, my duck finally came out. It took alittle long to come out. When it came out, it smelled good and the duck looked tender; which it was. The sauce had a nice body, nice consistency, and tasted very good. But when I had it with the rice, the rice tasted like it was old. But the real smack in the face is that this is an Asian restaurant..... how do u mess up on rice? It's like going to a taco restaurant and the tortillas is hard. I'm Asian and I know what is freshly made rice vs old rice lol. So I just ate the duck and left the rice alone. The service was pretty slow tbh. It took 15 mins for my duck to come out and it took about 10 mins to get a waiter for my check. I work in a restaurant and I understand how customers are, but the restaurant wasn't even full or even half full when I was waiting for my duck. But to wait 15 mins to get old rice? C'mon.... but since the pancake, curry, and the duck was delicious, I have to give 4\/5 despite having slow service and the rice being old or frozen.","stars":4.0}

The average price was $200 to $250; some range higher. Bridal gowns seemed to have better luck but since I was looking for a bridal dress to dance in, it was a dud because they only had 5 short dresses. Shirley was my consultant and was clever and fun to work with while shopping. She was witty and had great ideas. I really enjoyed working with her. There were four different rooms that were sectioned off, one section had a table with chairs. The negative is that the mirrors are flat (no 3 way view) and you cannot see the dress from behind unless you use a handheld mirror. I wouldn't buy my dress from the Macy's bridal but if a bride asked me my opinion I would still suggest going to try their dresses out. My bridesmaids didn't get their dresses from the salon but did find them on a clearance rack out on the floor (lucky!). Also, since it is located in the mall there are other department stores, retail shops and a place to grab food.","stars":4.0}

Triple A didn't come fast enough and I had no choice but to break the window to save my dog. I tried Safe Lite but they couldn't even fit me in until 2 days from when I broke my window!! I don't have a garage and its monsoon season (I also live in a sketchy neighborhood) so that wasn't going to work for me. I called Wisecrack first thing the next morning and they came within a couple hours! George was great and very professional, while we were doing paperwork he even greeted and pet my puppy for a bit. He also vacuumed all the glass from the break for me.

Tory took excellent care of us. Her recommendations were much appreciated and she always came by with a smile. We enjoyed the butter poached lobster to start and followed up with the scalibut and the parmesan crusted sheepshead.

I'm fairly sure they cook everything in a microwave. The last time I was there a customer returned his food because he was dissatisfied. I watched the new manager take the wings to the kitchen area and in sight eat the food. That was enough for me. I over heard this same manager talk to the bartender, that has been there for years now, as if it was her first day on the job. By far one of the most unprofessional \"managers\" I have meet to date. All my friends and I wanted was a comfortable and clean place to enjoy our night. Over the last six to eight weeks it has been extremely uncomfortable to be there. They brought the neon lights for the out side inside. I like a dive bar as much as the next person but this is EXTREMELY tacky. There are dozens of bars and restaurants in this area. Stopping and getting a six pack and a wawa hoagie and eating by the dumpster is a better night than this hole. One star is only because zero is not an option.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Kristel Oreto Review - I was tattooed by Kristel Oreto - I had nothing but problems, not once did she even attempt to help me. She initially was communicating with me through email then had some apprentice emailing me. And then he stopped and neither one of them has answered an email since. I was never given a phone number and the idiot apprentice told me my issues were because of my aftercare. Sorry fool, blowouts are not because of aftercare. Kristel Oreto overworked my piece to the point of having scarring and huge blowout issues throughout the entire piece. Now I'm stuck with an awful tattoo that's so embarrassing I can't even wear shorts or a skirt. My only option is to attempt laser removal, which is not guaranteed. Shame on you Kristel for not valuing your customers, who have made your career what it is. I contacted Gia who owns Ceremony Tattoo and met her at the Philly Convention who promised to schedule a consult to fix it since it happened in her shop. Gia asked me to send all correspondence to her assistant that transpired between Kristel, the apprentice and myself so she could see what went on, which I did. Gia was then unresponsive via email and then played games saying she shut down shop and had no where to tattoo. Except, I follow her on Instagram, and see that she is tattooing under White Oak Tattoo but is just blowing me off. You can't even go on Kristel's Facebook and leave a review. Something should be said about that. If the so called artist blocks you from giving feedback about their work, there's a reason. After digging, I have found more people who feel the same way. Shame, shame, shame on you Kristel Oreto. More pics available on: #kristeloreto #blowoutsarentmyfault #dorightbyyourcustomers","stars":1.0}

The first two times, I was blown away with the sushi, service, and my entree. The third time I visited however, made me reconsider the 5 star I felt they had originally deserved. Poor poor POOR service. My drink was rarely refilled and I felt ignored by the entire waitstaff the entire night. The food was still great and I will most likely still visit here again and recommend this place to friends.. But I will not do so without warning them of the one night my service was so poor, I was upset with paying the exorbitant prices. For 15-30 dollars an entree, I expect good service no matter what. Two out of three isn't a GREAT ratio.. But it deserves another chance. Will update this review when I visit again.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Uh yeah.... So this place was just ok. I expected more since every time I come to New Orleans there is a very long line outside. I came down with a group for new years, and since the sugar bowl crowd wasn't in town yet and there was no line outside, we decided to check it out. Since we had a large group we told one person to sit down and reserve a table... Big mistake. A worker promptly came over and said \"you need a receipt before you can sit down,\" even though there was hardly a line inside... O well. I am happy I read the yelp reviews before coming here that warned you to \"know what you want\" before it is time to order because as soon as you walk up to the counter, the uninviting workers rushed you through the process. My sister made the mistake of trying to order a water after being told the price. The worker kept repeating the price louder and louder as my sister asked for water, and the worker finally said, \"they will give it to you at the table.\" The attitude of the worker was unnecessary. I don't understand why she didn't say that when my sister first asked. Once we sat down we noticed a sign that said \"no tipping\" but when our waiter came over, the first thing she said was \"Feel free to tip if I do a good job!\" HUH?!?! Needless to say we were all confused, but since she was so sweet (the only nice person we encountered here) I did in the end. As for the food, I wasnt a fan of the ettouffee. It was too bland in my opinion. One person in our group ordered the jambalaya, I thought the flavors in that were very good, but there was very little meat. Being originally from Louisiana, this restaurant embarrassed me...From the food to the staff to the confusing signs. As for the warehouse looking interior that some people have complained about, that is typical rustic new orleans and I didn't have an issue with it. This will not be on the top of my list of places to visit next time I return to new Orleans... If it even makes the list....","stars":2.0}

There wasn't an attendant to be found so I used my wash code to go through again. After a second wash, still had grill bugs. I vacuumed my car and was waiting to see an attendant. About 10 minutes later, I finally saw someone who worked there and let them know that they didn't have any clean towels to dry off my car. I had given up on getting the bugs off at this point.

{"text":"Pretty awesome place. Wallpaper is NYC themed. Space is small but it's very homely. The food is amazing. Especially the spicy Sichuan shrimp and cumin lamb (which was initially off the menu). My favorite was the beef and ox tripe. If you can stomach it, it is bursting full of peppercorn and chili flavors just like the rest of the dishes. Their skewers are pretty decent especially the enoki mushrooms which are served only after 5pm. The sweet sour pork is very thinly cut and fired to a nice crisp taste that is neither all crust nor too meaty. Their noodles are also top notch. Their calamari fried rice is legit if you're looking for a rice dish. Their calamari isn't fishy at all and cooked just right. The hot crisp fish comes in abundance of fish meat in a hot pot and is bomb. Overall their Sichuan cuisine is pretty good even on par with standards compared to other major metropolitan areas. They do serve alcohol and are willing to give you extra servings of rice.","stars":5.0}

The interior is a little crammed at first when you're waiting to be granted into the line to order. However, once you're in, there are plenty of tables. They have a certain system that makes the place flow great. All around, you see different celebrities and sports stars raving about this place and rightfully so. The service was pretty friendly from the start. When we were waiting, the executive chef was the \"bouncer\" and handed out menus to people. Recommended items to people while we were waiting. It was unique in a sense. For the amount of people, we got our food daily fast after ordering. I was impressed with how hard the staff works. You don't see any standing around. The food was incredible. BBQ is something that's hard to differentiate, just like Mexican food. I ordered the turkey with potato salad and green beans. The turkey was cooked to perfection and was juicy. My mom bought some sweet potato fries and they were the best thing there. They were fried a certain way that put my tastebuds on a good high. The portions were more than generous, without sacrificing any quality. Overall, this place lived up to its hype and status as a BBQ Juggernaut on the national stage. I will defiantly be back and will go out of my way if I'm craving BBQ. Thanks for a great lunch! Thanks for reading as well...","stars":5.0}

Despite coming comfortably 2 hours before close we ended up being there until after closing.

The whole reason I use the website is to avoid talking on the phone with the staff at TIffin - there has always been an issue in the past.

{"text":"So my dog, Haven had not been to a groomer for several years. She had some winter under coat and smelled quite doggy. We found Puppy Bath nearby so I went in just to check them out. The owner explained their services to me in detail and was very friendly. She seemed to genuinely enjoyed and take pride her work. I decided to call on a Friday right when they opened and they were able to get our Haven in right away. I took her over and my usually timid dog sniffed her way from the parking lot right to the front door. She went straight in without a fuss and the groomers took her in as their own and were so sweet to her. When she was done being groomed they called me to let me know she was ready. Haven was beautiful, shiney and happy......and smelled sooooo much better. I am very pleased with their work and will be taking her back. I highly recommend them. There was another dog waiting for its owner there and he\/she was so well groomed and pretty.","stars":5.0}

If you're lucky, you'll snag a window seat so you can check out the (beautiful?) Delaware River while you dine. Don't worry about the black, plastic trash bags floating past your window - it's all a part of the experience! The food at Moshulu is seriously on-point, albeit on the pricy side. The pork belly appetizer was divine and I thoroughly enjoyed the duck for my entre\u00e9. My husband ordered the swordfish and while I'm not the biggest fan of seafood, I was begging him for more than just a bite of his food. I'm not sure if I would hurry back to Moshulu, but it's a nice option for a special occasion.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I travel nearly a 100 nights a year and am a complete foodie. I truly enjoy coming to NOLA several times of year to indulge in the cuisine. I really enjoy John Besh (I DVR all his shows on PBS) and was excited to try Borgne. My companion and I arrived for our 6:30 reservation. The restaurant was half full. They sat us next to the exit door of the kitchen. With all the available seats around... Why? I asked to be moved which they did with a smile. The first course was oysters on the half shell. They were delicious. We then ordered the smoked pork empanadas and turkey neck. The empanadas were OK.. The pie crust was very bready and meat on the dry side, but good flavor. The creole dipping sauce was simply overpowering for the empanadas. I dipped an empananda in the sauce from the turkey neck and it was a perfect compliment. The turkey neck itself was quite a flavorful surprise and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered a local craft brew and it was really nice. When I ordered a second one, it came in a ridiculously heavy goblet that is normally reserved for cheap margaritas in a tex-mex establishment. I asked why and the server said it just depends on who was pouring behind the bar? Really?? A pint should be a pint consistently served in this level of restaurant. The vibe of the place was wrong.. My companion hit it straight on.. This place isn't comfortable. Plastic chairs, sterile d\u00e9core. Nothing that speaks to the food. We decided to go elsewhere for our entrees simply because we wanted a NOLA feel. This doesn't make Borgne a bad restaurant, but not what I had hoped for seeing how I respect Besh's approach to food in the many interviews I have seen of him.. We will look forward to trying his other places in town.","stars":2.0}

Given the quality of seafood and desserts the price point is well below what you'd be be forking out in another city like Chicago or New York. Highlights: (1) we've tried all 3 Louisiana oysters and found the area oysters (cheapest to boot) to be the most succulent and rewarding in taste (2) grilled whole red snapper (approx. 2 LBS) in white soy lime and peanut sauce was very tasty; (3) crawfish & jalapeno capellini - just the right amount of heat but we found the noodles to be overcooked; (4) desserts were the knock outs - key lime pie was sublime and the strawberry napoleon had all the right textures and the right amount of sweetness.","stars":5.0}

No sauce, no cheese on the 5 layer (4 layer?), practically no chicken, and a stale tortilla. So he calls and lets them know. He's promised 2 free combos. The day manager says he will make a note so my husband can collect the apology meals soon. I go to pick these up and wait 15+ minutes in line to be told there is no note and they can't make good because the manager isn't there. Unapologetic, unwilling to compromise.

{"text":"Dimples is a staple in the massive Maryland Farms business district, a local delicatessen offering freshly-made sandwiches, breakfast food, and desserts. It's literally minutes from my house and I've meant to try it for years. Blending in with the surrounding businesses in a mundane strip mall, it doesn't stand out from the road. But my mother-in-law highly recommended it, having been there many times. So I finally scoured the menu in advance, made my game plan, and anxiously arrived at Dimples one afternoon. With a solid recommendation, a good looking menu, and its close proximity to my house, I was prepared to make this my regular spot. I couldn't wait!!! Rather than welcoming me into their restaurant, the woman behind the counter glared at me as I ordered, seemingly unamused with life in general. Sure, the \"Welcome to Moe's!!!\" chant that employees are required to offer up when you enter their taco shop seems a little forced, but at least it makes you feel welcome. As I asked questions about the sandwich I was ordering, always fearful that a cook will smear disgusting mayonnaise all over a sandwich, or loads of slimy tomatoes, or other condiments I dislike, I wanted to make sure that my order only contains things I like; spicy mustard, banana peppers, provolone cheese, things like that. The woman grew incredibly impatient and was terribly rude, acting astonished that I was asking her one, maybe two questions tops! How dare I? Well, I guess I must be the only Naahvillian who doesn't know what comes on the sandwiches at Dimples!!! After humiliating me in front of other customers, I embarrassingly completed my order. The woman rolled her eyes, placed the order, and took my money, as if they'll do just fine whether or not I become a loyal customer. As the third generation in my family to work in the restaurant industry, there are two things that I will not tolerate from a server or cashier taking my order, two things that are inexcusable in the world of food service. Rule #1: Never be rude to a customer. Rule #2: Never let my water glass reach empty. I don't require anything else from the person taking my order, and subsequently taking my money. You don't have to be peppy, you don't have to be my friend, you don't have to ask me if I need anything else 500 times. Just keep the water glass full and exhibit a modicum of politeness. Everything beyond that is the chef's responsibility; timely preparation, quality of food, presentation. Already jaded, I subtracted two Yelp stars in my mind and was still willing to give Dimples a 3. But after behaving like it was my privilege for being allowed into their amazing restaurant, the sandwich wasn't that amazing after all! It was good, but it wasn't Katz's Delicatessen good. So Dimples, you get 2 stars. Moral of the story: Dimples doesn't care if you come to their restaurant or not. They can survive without you. And if you do brave lunch here, don't you","stars":2.0}
{"text":"I love this bar, it's fancy but not pretentious. The sunsets you can see from here are fabulous. And their drinks are good too! I've had a gin and tonic and a coconut mojito. My husband tried their \"jam session.\" I'd order the mojito again. As for the jam session, I didn't try it. My husband got it, because it had bourbon in it. He said he probably wouldn't get it again, because they mixed jam in it which has seeds (not his favorite). It literally had the name \"jam\" in it, so I'm not sure what he expected. They also have food. Not just light bites, they have full on burgers here. I haven't got any, but there were a few tables ordering food. I guess that's a bit confusing regarding the service. It's hard to tell whether to sit or go to the bar and order. I guess it depends whether you're eating. My go to is just ordering from the bar. Otherwise, I do wish the bathrooms upstairs had more stalls (it's just 2 bathrooms -- one for men and another for women). If you go downstairs, there are more stalls.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Let me put it this way - if you are looking for a good biryani in St. Louis, there are plenty of really good options from West County to O Fallon suburbs. Even home catering outfits make a decent biryani if you know where to go. So for a new restaurant to come into St Louis and claim they make the best biryani around, it better be spectacular! From the 2 stars I've given this place, it's obvious they are far from being anywhere close to it! We visited this place during Father's Day lunch and had a terrible experience. But what prompted me to write this review was a catered dinner event that I had at a friends place where the food was provided by Paradise. The quality of the food was a travesty and if it were me, I would take it back to this restaurant and demand they get out of the food business. Horrible food prepared by someone who appears to have been given instructions over the phone in a foreign language! Of the 3 main dishes that were ordered, the base curry all tasted the same and the only difference was one had meat, the other had paneer and the third had a hodgepodge of vegetables throw in! This would have been okay if it actually tasted good but it appeared to be stale chicken, paneer and vegetables that were defrosted to make a mess! The experience at Father's Day lunch was a little different. This time it was a $13 per person lunch buffet that had literally nothing left in the buffet at noon. People were made to wait outside for an hour and once you were seated, it was another long line at the buffet waiting for someone to refill the dishes. Of the dozen or so items on the buffet we may have got to try about 4 which we had to scrape off the bottom after waiting in line for at least 30 additional minutes. The owner was genuinely apologetic but he seemed to do nothing about stopping people from coming in despite the food being over! This place does not deserve to be around and ride on the success of the original Paradise restaurant in Hyderabad (they claim no affiliation to this chain!). If these guys need to survive they have to get their act together and not rip off their customers. St Louis deserves better than this!","stars":2.0}
{"text":"When you first walk in to the hotel there's a cute little lobby area with limited seating and a nice breakfast area. The parking was not very good. I had to search for quite some time to find a place to park. At first appearances on the outside, I was like \"Oh s***!\" But when I got inside, I was comforted because it was very clean and orderly. The person who greeted me was very professional and friendly. My room was on the second floor and when I stepped off of the elevator I smelled a little musty odor. I was really concerned that it was not going to be a good stay but I changed once I stepped into my room. I got King bed room. It wasn't as updated as the other Fairfield Inns that I've stayed in but it had all of the basics. It had a 42 inch TV, a refrigerator, a microwav, and a small coffee maker. The carpets were clean, too. I always check the bed and there were no signs of bed bugs or bugs of any kind. The bathroom is nothing special. There was a little rust around the drain hole in the tub but it was clean. The highlight of my stay was the Paul Mitchell products. I washed my hair in that wonderful smelling Tea Tree shampoo and that Lemon Sage conditioner. It was awesome! I also enjoyed the Lemon Sage body wash. I usually use my own soap but it smelled so refreshing and clean that I continued to use it throughout my stay. One thing that kind of spooked me was I was getting out of the shower and I happened to look up at the fan and there was a little green light inside of the fan! Now anyone who has watched any of those creepy movies where there's a stalker who uses cameras to spy on their victims, a little, hidden, flashing light in the bathroom fan makes you wonder... So, I called down and the receptionist didn't know why the light was there but she called maintenance and then when they didn't call back she went into one of the rooms and saw the light in that room too. She asked a manager and the manager said she's not quite sure what it was but it's in every room so it might be some kind of Sanitation or air filter or something like that but it was pretty damn creepy! I don't know y'all. Anyhoo, Breakfast is served from 6:30 a.m. to 10 am. They had the standard fare of hot breakfast including eggs, sausage, tater tots, and biscuits. You can even make your own waffles. I didn't see the waffle mix so it might not have been offered right now. And if you're in a hurry and have to get to work, they have to-go boxes and a nice woman who fixed me a to-go box. It wasn't a bad stay for the price point.","stars":3.0}

It's been more than 10 days since I cancelled the appointment and was told that it'll be processed but I called again but they just told me to wait for a callback that most likely isn't even happening!

I like pretty much every sandwich and grilled meat that this place has to offer, and they have a lot. The only thing I wish they did a little better was their sides, and in some cases their cooking times. The samosas have usually been sitting in the warmer for a while, so they're no longer crispy, and the rice and curried lentils and other things are all just aight. Again, the grill is where this place shines. I've eaten in, and I've taken out, and I've learned that when I want some Kabobeesh, I call 30-45 minutes ahead to make sure whatever I'm getting is ready. It's totally worth the wait, and it's damn cheap for what you get, but yeah - if you're hungry, you might want to get something in your stomach before coming here.","stars":3.0}

All the bartenders know my favorite beers. I could start singing the Cheers theme song, but you get my point, I think. As far as food goes, it's my favorite fried food late-night munchies place in the city. The fried pickles and mac n' cheese bites are Om Nom tastic. None of the food has ever really been particularly disappointing, although if you're veggie\/vegan, your choices may be a tad limited.

{"text":"This studio was a find through a groupon or living social type deal. Probably would not have checked them out without it, because if you read my other yoga reviews, you will see how cheap I am. I say that as a disclaimer, not as a badge of honor. However, now that I've been to the studio, I love it and am considering buying a package. The studio is absolutely gorgeous - haven't been upstairs, but the downstairs is a great space. Totally agree with another review that raved about how much space is around you. Probably the only studio I've been to in New Orleans where I am consistently happy about my personal space. Other plusses: -free mats, props to borrow -teachers (or at least Mary) make use of varied props - can be fun and gives you more ideas for variations on poses, especially during restorative or relaxation poses -great locker room space to change As far as specific experiences, I can only speak to one class and one teacher: Mary - Thursdays at 6. She is amazing. Every time I go to her class, I do something I've never done before. She is a talented vocalist and basically forces you to do the compulsory chanting\/singing, but her voice is so beautiful, you almost want to do it just to hear her sing along with you. She's enthusiastic and one of the most hands-on teachers I've practiced with - and I mean that in a helpful-I-never-knew-my-body-could-do-that way versus an annoying hovering. She cares about your alignment and your practice; she is never phoning it in as a teacher. She does variations on her corpse poses in terms of music or interesting meditations. I swear I cried one day in her class at the end because it was all just so wonderful and I felt like, for a short time, I knew my place in the universe. It sounds dramatic and cheesy, but what can I say? The class is great. I mean, ending your practice with meditations on the universe by Neil deGrasse Tyson??? Amazing. Other interesting points to her class -difficult and unusual poses, but plenty of variation if you aren't into it -lots of 1:1 assistance, even when class is fairly big -she also teaches occasional paddleboard yoga classes - super fun for something different to try","stars":5.0}

A glass of wine was accidentally spilled because the tables are the size of quarters and the workers deemed it appropriate to not serve our table after that. They also commented on the volume of our party: there was three of of us. I have never been so disrespected at an establishment that serves overpriced wine. I will NEVER come back to this location due to the rudeness of the staff and insulting behavior. We ended up leaving upon ordering another round and nothing arrived until a timid employee expressed they couldn't serve us anymore.

Had to wait a hour for my prescription. I picked out items that were marked reduced and since I had time to spare I scanned them to find they were not marked down. I then double checked regularly advertised items as well. Not the price advertised. To insure I wasnt wrong I went back to grab other items to find the same results with most. I then went to the till to ask cashier to please price check my seeds she ignored me 3 times. I asked her what the deal was since my order was over 300 she was rude stating we dont know. She said it's not this Turkey, I said I dont care I wanted the turkey. Till infront of service desk she didnt find out what the free gift was after I was upset and started to ask my self. She then made another rude comment she had no room as I was packing my groceries as quick as I could while trying to get some response. I wanted to watch the prices of my items as they were put through but they have the plexiglass now infront and the screens pointed inwards. How convenient. Get home to find I was over charged on several items. I have tried to call for 3 days now to not even getting a ringing. Iam disgusted a company would take advantage 0f people at a time like this!

{"text":"We were so excited to have a new thai place close by, and thai is by far one of our favorite,, but we were very disappointed. I have had food that just wasn't good, but this was just BAD. We ordered the fresh summer rolls with tofu and they were delivered immediately. The tofu pieces were so small I was sure at first they forgot to put it in . They were under lots and lots of lettuce. The rolls had no distinct flavor and the accompanying peanut sauce had a layer of oil on top. It was warm but did not taste fresh I ordered garlic chicken with rice. The color was unusual and after only a couple bites I found it inedible. I can eat most anything, but I could not identify the taste, which sad to say, was neither chicken, nor garlic . It had an aftertaste that was reminiscent of something that has been around for awhile. My friend ordered the Meekatee Pork. She too found her meal a bit nauseating. It had a layer of oil on top, and if there were carrots and other vegetables, it wasn't obvious. The flavor was sweet, but also had an old, unfresh taste. They should also let you know that dish can feed a family of 4 and since we don't like to waste food, leftovers would have been welcome under better circumstances. My friend was also only able to take a couple bites and we could not get out of there fast enough. The wait staff and ambience were both pleasant but given that we both felt queasy upon leaving, for a $42 lunch, with water to drink, we will not be returning.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"This is your average Chinese takeout place. Combo platters run around $7 and come with pork fried rice and an egg roll. The sesame chicken was pretty average: a high fried-batter-to-chicken ratio, and the sauce was tooth-numbingly sweet. Seriously, they could use that sauce in place of Novocaine. It came with 2 pieces of steamed broccoli which were extremely bland, but I guess that's just what happens when you steam vegetables. Plus, I guess something has to balance out the supersweet sauce. The fried rice was fine, it wasn't as heavy and greasy as fried rice from a Chinese takeout place can be. The veggie dumplings were just okay, but then again I like my dumplings with meat, so maybe the lack of meat was the problem there. On the other hand, the scallion pancakes were good. They were on the thinner side and not super greasy, the way scallion pancakes should be. The lo mein looked decent as well. The french fries were really good too, with the dimensions of McDonald's fries but crisper, less salty, and not soggy at all. I guess the food here is less heavy and greasy than China Inn, and seems fresher. If you have a craving for greasy Chinese, this place is not it. Overall, it's decent takeout if you live in the area, but I would by no means go out of my way to eat here.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I had a very poor experience dealing with Creative Comp. Inquired about purchasing a GoPro Hero4 Silver after finding an advertisement on Craigslist. Need to up my selfie game, right? It was marked down significantly despite being sold as \"New in Box\" so I asked all the right questions to determine if the item was slightly used & placed back inside the original packaging, if repairs were done, etc. Response: \"Because people are cheap especially on Craigslist. It's brand new in sealed box.\" Okay, fair enough. Let's make sure I'm not getting ripped off and being fed some bogus story... \"Understood. I see you're a business on Passyunk - Are you guys a licensed vendor of GoPro products? Because if this is a resale, then the manufacturer's warranty is then voided, and then it really isn't 'new'.\" \"Dude, buy it somewhere else.\" Wow. Okay. So, instead of being up-front and honest about the product, and making me go on GoPro's website to factually determine they aren't a licensed reseller vendor of GoPro products, they opted to be rude and awfully snide. Damn the customer who thinks to research their $350 investment. So long story short, two lessons were learned on this day... 1) Creative Comp is some combination of rude, immature, untruthful, & grouchy and 2) my selfie game might not recover from this let-down.

(I stupidly thought he was a doctor because he was wearing a lab coat and surgical mask around his neck.) I found out later that he is not a doctor. He never corrected me. And he saw me half naked. (He now has hired female technicians.) I had an appointment once...drove 45 minutes to their clinic in Millwoods, to find a \"Closed for Renovations\" sign on the door. No one called me to reschedule. I wasted 90 minutes of my time driving, and spent the morning shaving my hair in places that aren't good to shave unless you have a laser treatment done right away. Needless to say, my razor burn wasn't the only reason I was upset. I agree with the comments about the personality of the owner. I once saw him double park his hummer in two handicapped parking stalls. (Classy.) I was worried for my safety with regards to the machines he uses because one of my laser treatments gave me a mini burn on my lip.

That part of the pedicure was great. However, I wasn't blown away by the actual care of my toenails. The filing, cuticle trimming and actual paint job were sloppy, and the tech wasn't even rushing. Also, she didn't spend much time at all with the pumice stone on my heels, as they were still rough within 30 min after the pedi. That being said, the massage was worth it. Next time I will just pay closer attention during the pedi to give directions instead of drifting off to sleep lol! The manicure on the other hand was done very well. I got just a regular one, and it lasted for about 5 or 6 days without chipping. I've been in S Jersey for about 3 years now and have been struggling to find a good mani\/pedi spot (I've actually driven the hour back up North to my old regular spot).

Whenever we have seen them out on the property or asked a question they have always been very welcoming and helpful. But more importantly, we are happy to report that we have had zero maintenance issues here. Last year we lived at a brand new complex in the area which had several maintenance issues including going without a\/c for a week in the middle of the summer. Based on what friends and neighbors told us several of the units (in that brand new complex where we used to live) had a\/c issues as well as other issues. We also love how quiet & peaceful it is here at Camden Preserve. No tankers or trains going by here. We also love how well maintained the grounds of the complex are kept. The pond, fountain and the kayak launch on the bay are lovely. There are several benches located throughout the complex so you can sit in the sun and relax on a beautiful day. The gym is great and the pool areas are beautiful. There is a very nice dog park which our pups really enjoy.

So while your waiting for your masseuse your sides are exposed and your feet aren't covered. The towel on the massage table was also old and slightly tattered on the ends. The masseuse spent a good 15 minutes massaging me with the towel on. This didn't allow forna good grip and her hands kept sliding. It wasn't until I asked if the entire massage was with a towel, that she lowered the towel and began to use massage oil on my back. Also the masseuse left the room three times 1without any explanation. Once was to get some hot wrap to place on my neck once for hit towels to remove the oil and once because someone yelled out for her and she went to attend them. Despite this my massage still ended within 60 minutes. No additional time was added for these interruptions. Last issue was that my feet weren't massaged. That is my favorite part! When I noticed she was winding down the massage I asked about my feet and she said there was not enough time. I wouldn't go back here and don't think it was worth the $80.00 they charge.","stars":2.0}

Upon a few of the individuals ordering drinks, multiple drinks were made incorrectly and\/or wrong liquor used within the drink ordered. On one of my guest orders a French 75 that 1st came out completely wrong, then after getting the replacement it came out hot. Another guest order a Prosecco that came out warm and had re-ordered another one that the server never brought out. A drink was also ordered by a guest that she wanted made with Cognac. The server then stated tol her that the drink is only made with Gin in which my guest replied it can be made either with Gon OR Cognac in which the server stated, here we only make it with Gin. Now, mind you, the person ordering the drink is a well-known bar tender at G.W. Finns. The server then refuted and stated she would ask someone in which came back and advised it would be made with cognac. It seemed the server was more trying to ensure she was trying to possibly follow rules instead of ensuring the customers were taken care of. Food and appetizers were ordered. Apps for those that ordered came out well. It was time for main food meals to be ordered. With me being on a intermediate carb fast, in ordered from the kids menu to ensure I control my portions not over-eat. About 3 minutes or so later after taking our order, the server returned and stated her manager told her that the kids menu is only for those ages 10 and lower and\/or only IF You order 2 or more items. I advised I called up to the restaurant prior to arrival and asked and was told it would be ok to order from kids menu and also that it does not have an age limit listed no where on the menu AND the fact that she took my order initially as if it was not an issue. She seemed to have no remorse and pretty made it aware that was no deviation from what she was told, which forced me in to ordering a larger meal portion.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"My husband and I were both overwhelmingly disappointed in this place... and it takes a lot for us to be disappointed. It has some redeeming factors such as crab legs for extra. As a vegetarian there were VERY few options. They didn't even have spring rolls. There were no tofu dishes. My husband is not a vegetarian and said that the things he tried were essentially unrecognizable. Said the crab rangoon tasted like ricotta instead of cream cheese, the egg rolls were gross, and none of the dishes were even edible. This place is now named Hibachi.","stars":1.0}

Yet Macklind Ave charges Subway prices. They've got every soft drink known to man and virtually every cold beer selection. They used to do an italian beef sandwich once a week, which was to die for.

{"text":"Lovely facility, organized and easy scheduling and a friendly staff. However, my husband and I went in for a full body skin check. It is important for us to do this on a regular basis as we have previously been diagnosed with melanoma. We are well versed in the procedure. Lie down on the table, the doctor wears special goggles and systemically scans your body in sections. Bottom of feet, between fingers and toes, sections your hair and looks at your scalp...every nook and cranny. It takes a minimum of thirty minutes. This was my experience with Dr. Ross: She wore no goggles, I sat upright and stood to have her check my back. No scalp check, did not check bottom of feet, between fingers and toes, underside of breast and did not scan my body line by line. It took less than five minutes. My husband had the same experience, with the exception, she checked his scalp. I take my skin checks seriously and left with little peace of mind. Although she did take a couple of biopsy's per my suggestion. We scheduled our skin checks back to back and left there completely shocked.

{"text":"Me giving them two stars is being generous. I came here a week ago with my boyfriend and his Indian grandparents. Like some of these reviews say we were greeted by the owner, sat down and that's when the customer service ended. We ordered the Samosas and vegetarian options, when the server asked us how spicy we said we like a little bit but not super spicy and he said so medium. We clarified that it wouldn't be too spicy and agreed to medium. The samosas came out and they were huge! However they were frozen cold in the center. The peas were literally frozen in the center. It took us 10 mins to get our waiter and we resulted in walking up to the front to get him ourselves. When the waiter came to the table I explained it was frozen to which he PUT HIS FINGER IN MY SAMOSA. Now I understand he wanted to see if it was actually cold. But then he said, \"well that's not my fault, I don't cook them\". He walked away to go get who, I'm assuming was the owners wife. She took our plates and apologized multiple times. She brought us new samosas free of charge and for that I gave them two stars. However it gets worse. The \"medium\" spicy food we ordered was EXTREMELY spicy. My boyfriend and his grandparents are used to eating traditional spicy Indian food. The food was almost unbearable and his poor grandmother had to get more yogurt sauce because her mouth was on fire. We also had to ask for refills on water multiple times before we got any which took like 15 mins. Also, the garlic naan was semi-burnt when they brought it out. At that point we were done telling the staff our problems because clearly they didn't seem to care.","stars":2.0}

Another girl finally popped up and they were awkwardly going around our table putting menus down and extra silverware. We waited 20 minutes for our food, nobody checked on us, ever. The manager showed up saying he had just taken a quick shower at his house.... We didn't even touch our plates and had to wait another 15' to get the check. Manager hands my husband the check upside down and he turns it over in the table and manager takes it away from him. Ok wait, we haven't even seen the check yet!!

We had just come from IKEA and wanted something that was a little nicer but with a similar price. We were greeted right away by a sales associate who let us wander but also was attentive. He helped us pick out a couch and loveseat for a great deal with free delivery and 48 months interest free financing. I asked about when the big sale was ending because we took measurements of the doorways but I wanted to be 100% sure that the couch would fit. They told me that the sale was ending tomorrow, with that in mind we went ahead and bought the couches. We were sold and I was so excited that I agreed to the 3 week waiting period with a MAXIMUM delivery date of 1 month or (May 26th). Three weeks came and went with NO word from Ashley Furniture. Finally I called on the 22nd and they informed me that the couches were in the warehouse and they could set up a delivery time. I'm not sure why they didn't call me then?? I informed her about the guaranteed delivery by the 26th (Memorial Day) and asked that the couches be delivered on Saturday (the 24th). She rudely informed me that Saturday had been booked for weeks and that I would have to do it the next week. PAST THE GUARANTEED DATE. So I had been waiting a month for these couches!! On the delivery day the loveseat went into the apartment just fine but then lo and behold the big couch didn't fit. It was taken back to Ashley Home Furniture. After a month of waiting I was quite dismayed and called the store to hear my options. I was placed on hold for 15 minutes and then told that no one could speak to me so I would have to leave my number for someone to call me back. I did and then an hour went by. I called again and asked to speak to someone since no one had called me and she informed me that she had left my number for the sales associate who had originally helped us to call me back THE NEXT DAY. I was super frustrated and said i wanted to talk to someone today. She put me on the phone with a horrendously rude sales associate who told me I could either come in and reselect new couches or if I wanted to return them they would take 25% of the entire cost of the couch as a \"restocking fee\"..... That's $102 to pay for a couch that I never physically received because I'm not an freaking engineer and was pressured to buy that day!!! I was irate and wanted to speak to a manager.

{"text":"I just got back from living in Vietnam! I've read the reviews below, and have found that many simply don't know what they're talking about. I noticed that nobody in the reviews seemed to know the names of the people at the counter whom they were making reviews about. Annie is really friendly, attentive, and sweet. She also knows how to make a Banh Mi that's both authentic and traditional. Mya\/Maya (sorry if I mispell!) is a hard worker and very friendly as well. Vietnam is built around service culture, a standard which Annie and Mya\/Maya live up to. The traditional banh mi (#1) totally lives up to all of the many types that I've tried in Vietnam. Not only that, but they have a loyalty card and an awesome menu! Now, let's go ahead clear up some of the unfair misconceptions found in the other reviews. First, in Vietnam, most business owners get their bread from local breadmakers who ride around on bikes, pull a cart down the street, or walk around with bags of banh mi. Banh mi vendors often don't make the bread themselves. The exception is usually the tourist traps that overcharge, or really expensive sitdown restaurants found in Ha Noi and District 1 of HCMC. If you want to pay $100 for a touristy banh mi with bread made in-house, have at it. Second, the outside of the bread is supposed to be hard and crunchy, almost to the point of flaking whenever you take a bite. If you want soft bread, they'll toast it less, but it'll be less authentic. Honestly, if that's what you'd prefer, I'd say stick with Wawa. It's supposed to be crunchy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. That's how it's done at QT. Third, there isn't supposed to be a ton of meat and vegetables inside of the sandwich. Also, stop calling it a hoagie. It's a sandwich, not a hoagie. The bread is supposed to be most of what you taste. The idea is that the vegetables and meat are supposed to have a more gentle taste to them. If you want an overstuffed sandwich that's intended to make you overweight, go to Wawa or some local cheesesteak joint, but don't ask QT to sacrifice tradition on your behalf.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"YOU MUST TELL EVERYONE TO GO HERE!! Now that I've got your attention, I can tell you why. Dr Serang is a phenomenal dentist and the staff there is excellent. To start with...you want your dentist to be few things in my opinion. You want them to continue educating themselves, be welcoming and approachable, be able to adequately educate you on what they are doing, have a great knowledge base, be gentle and not too aggressive, be technically sound, and actually enjoy what they do. Dr Serang does ALL of this and more. If you look around his office you'll see continuing education certificates, he's very easy to talk to and explains thins in a very simple manner so anyone can understand, he's quick but very thorough, and PAINLESS. One of the biggest things I think that keeps people away from a dentist is PAIN. My last dentist was a HUGE improvement from the one I went to before. I thought they were great. Dr Serang took it to a whole new level. From the minute you step into the office till the time you leave, if you experience any pain during the process at all I'd be surprised. Overall, it's a great place to go to for your dental needs. I already recommended him to everyone else I work with (and I'm not one to go out of my way and recommend things...even something as simple as a restaurant) but I felt like I really wanted to.

{"text":"I have contemplated posting this review for a couple of months but I've finally decided to go ahead with it. Back in September I was looking for a nail salon that would do what I wanted for my wedding. I had gone to aria a couple of times and liked the place but didn't know which tech was the best for acrylic sets. I called and asked and the lady on the phone didn't say a specific person, I let her know that I wanted my nails done for my wedding and she said okay that they can do that for me. She asked me what I wanted and I told her I wanted ombr\u00e9 possibly with glitter details again she said okay. Took my name and we set up an appt. Later on realized I wasn't given a price so I called back, the person asked for what I was looking for I told her and they quoted me $90 for a full set with ombr\u00e9. I knew the place was a little expensive but that sounded a bit high. I did some research asked around and everyone said it was expensive. I then realized that I was probably over quoted for mentioning the word wedding. So I asked my sister to call and give them the same work and ask for a price. She did and they told her $50-60! I was disappointed that they were trying to charge me an extra $40 just bc i mentioned my wedding. I called the salon and asked why i was given such a high price when my sister received a much less quote, it was the same lady that I had initially spoken with. She got upset and was super defensive and tried to tell me that ombr\u00e9 is expensive, I mentioned that my sister called and asked for the same thing and her price was about $40 cheaper. She started stumbling over her words and didn't have any reasonable response so I told her to cancel my appt and she hung up on me. Super unprofessional and very disappointed. I have since gonna to multiple nail salons and not one has tried to charge $40 for ombr\u00e9.","stars":1.0}

Friday came and there was no contact until husband contacted the store to inquire about table top.

{"text":"One of the best steaks I have ever had. My mom, girlfriend, and I all got the New York strip cooked medium. When I saw the 2.5\" thick 12 oz. steak sitting in front of me, I never thought it would be cooked perfectly all the way thru...but it was. Whatever the seasoning is they out on the steak is amazing. It has a nice crunch on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. The house salad is pretty awesome as well. I never thought I would like walnuts, apple pieces, Gorgonzola cheese, and craisins mixed in with lettuce and dressing. I highly recommend this place, it's well worth the money and leaves you wanting more because it was so good. And the service was very good and our waiter knew the menu well and was very polite and helpful.","stars":5.0}

Great change of pace from coffee shop land - was able to get work done and relax at the same time. Loved that they served 5 oz. pours so that patrons can try several different beers. Also loved that I could get growlers to take home to my hosts! Of all that I tried, I have to say the porter was really something special - incredibly vanilla tones on that.

The chips they serve when you sit down were crunchy & the sauces were delicious, especially the avocado & cilantro based sauce with a little heat from jalape\u00f1os; more unique than your typical pico or salsa. I asked the owner what he recommended & he suggested the pupusas which were originally a recipe from El Salvador. The papusas are a handmade corn pancake of sorts stuffed with your choice of ingredients like chicken, beans, cheese, etc. I had the pork carnitas & cheese, while my coworker had 3 different ones with chicken, pork & spinach (he enjoyed the spinach best). The pupusas came with a pickled slaw & tomato drizzle on top & wow! They were delicious & very unique. I live Mexican food & haven't eaten anything like that before. The owner was so friendly & very knowledgeable about the food as should be. I highly recommend it.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I am a big fan of steamed soup dumplings. If you haven't tried them before, it's basically a steamed dumpling that is extra juicy. The outer skin should be on the thin side, unlike the regular steamed dumplings that you get from Chinese restaurants. I really enjoyed the soup dumplings here. I read a review about this place and decided to try it for lunch one day. Very happy tummy! ;o) Now, I wouldn't say that this is a good hang-out place or a place to take a date. The decor is lacking. It's not trendy or romantic. Just go there if you're hungry for soup dumplings. Another note, the restaurant is right next door to a Chinatown bus company (not the one that I usually use). So, eat some soup dumplings to fill your tummy and then hop on a bus to New York and have a night out on the town! It's only 2 hours each way ... I haven't tried anything else on the menu. When I do, I'll revise my review.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I've been here twice and, each time, this place gets better and better. It's a little BYOB on Walnut that's easy to miss as it's essentially the last street before you gun it over the Schuylkill toward UPenn. We started off with the mozzarella cheese with vegetables and enjoyed its light flavor. It wasn't doused in salt for \"flavor\" like other places. I then ordered one of their specials...the veal and home made ravioli in a cream sauce. It came out in what looked like little islands of veal\/ravioli in a sea of cream sauce, yumm. It looked deceivingly small, but as I went forward, this plate really filled me up. I'm usually not a veal fan either, but the way the three items came together felt like a classic comfort food. Extra bonus: the service here is top notch. The servers are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. Another little quirk I like is that they actually mention the price of the specials when they explain it. One thing I HATE about other restaurants is when they mention a special and it's 3-4x the average price of an entree on the menu, which is why I typically avoid ordering them. Great place, I'll be back again...don't forget the wine!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"This place is a culinary experience!! Every foodie must visit this place. The service from everyone is what the gold standard is set by. I loved how every staff member you encountered said, \"Welcome in\". It's was also refreshing to be catered to in such a fancy manner. It's nice the place requires the patrons to dress up. You don't have very many places left that require a collard shirt. Loved it!! They greeted me with pork jowl over a polenta cake. It was exquisite. Very nice palate teaser. The bread afterwards was toasted and cheesy. Then it's time to order libations. Which I had the Commander's martini for 25 cents when you order an entree. Then they bring you a menu. I thought that was neat as most places start you off by giving you a menu. Creole Tostada The presentation was awesome. It was fufu looking and hardy. It was much spicer than I had anticipated, not over powering heat where you couldn't enjoy, just a presence to let you know it was bold and there. Delicious blend of flavors with the Carolina style pull pork and the pur\u00e9e red beans. Loved it. Souffl\u00e9 bread pudding This was to die for. The presentation alone was elaborate. It was light with the souffl\u00e9 topping and a perfect density to the bread pudding. Not soupy, not a brick, it was just right. Loved it! You must get this if nothing else. Make sure you plan for a leisure dining experience, as this is not a place or experience that you want rush. My compliments to the staff and the chefs.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"The Edgehill Branch of the Nashville Public Library is most convenient to my house, so I decided to try going there instead of dealing with the traffic and the parking garage at the Main Library. It's a small branch, and is fine if you're just looking to use a computer, read a magazine, and check out some DVDs, children's books, or popular fiction. But if you're hoping to browse the poetry section or walk away with a stack of obscure graphic novels, you're better off going to the main branch. Depending on who's working and whether or not the computers are behaving, be warned that some of the staff here can get be a little testy. They do have about 7 public computers, which you have to sign up for on the designated reservations computer when you arrive. The homework room is surprisingly large, about half the size of the main room, with big laminate tables for kids to do their work on.

While I enjoyed the crisp and light texture of the pastries almost all of them were way too sweet for my tastes. The French waffle in particular was so sweet I could only take one bite. I did like the marzipan truffle though. The sweetness level of that dessert was alright and I enjoyed the almond flavor of the marzipan with the chocolate filling and chocolate dipped ends.

The fish and chips plate was nothing short of glorious. And I am thankful that I don't live within walking distance of their kitchen because I would not be able to go more than a day without stopping in for one of their mouth-watering burgers. Even the bread they sit you down with is perfect, sourced from the inimitable Baker Street Bread in Chestnut Hill. This place, hipster vibe and all, takes food and drink very seriously.

Having waited such a long time between cuts, my hair was a total disaster. I begged her not to cut it all off and she did her best to save what she could. She compromised with me and cut off the split ends and gave me a mask to treat the left over dryer ends. My hair looks and feels amazing without much loss and I honestly couldn't be happier.

Vaso has CHEAP drinks. Most, if not all, beers are $5 (what up, Abita Strawberry on draft!). My friend had a cocktail and even that was only $5. When the bartender asked for $10, I shook as I handed over a 20, thinking she added it up wrong. Vaso is also spacious with a big stage in the front. There was a jazz band performing when we arrived and they were nice to listen to. Some people were dancing, others were bobbing their heads. Their bathrooms are super clean and have an attendant to hand you towels (not paper towels mind you, real towels). I gave her a tip since it's the right thing to do and also how does she deal with the drunks? She reminded me the \"drunks\" don't really wind up on Frenchmen Street and that is very, very true.

Unfortunately for me, my accident was on a Thursday night and they would not release my car on Friday even after all paperwork was accounted for.

I wS more focused on the wine, which also did not disappoint. The green beans were cooked perfectly as well, which is more difficult than one might imagine. Just the right amount of crunch.

{"text":"I had been eyeing this place for a while and finally had the perfect opportunity to go in for dinner. It was about 8 or so and it was pretty slow inside we waited to be seated and we're seated near the bar. A waiter took our drink orders and then another waiter Chris took our dine in orders. He didn't mention any specials or ask if we had any questions about the menu. At the time I had not thought anything of this until another group was sat next to us and when Chris greeted them he read off all of the drink and dinner specials for that night. This was disappointing because the specials sounded really delicious and I probably would have ordered one of those. Our waiter just seemed very disinterested in us and more focused on the table next to us as they received excellent service. Service here I give 1 star. The food that we had ordered was delicious my friend had ordered the Mac and cheese and I had ordered the prime rib sliders with shoestring potatoes. Mac and cheese was cooked perfectly and great flavors. The sliders were great as well fries were nice and crispy. 2 stars overall because the food was undeniable I will return and hopefully be able to update my review","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Went there w a groupon. The food is Americanized. The waiter wouldn't honor my other groupon even tho my 2 year old son and 4 year old daughter got their own dish and was told ahead of time. The waiter came back and misunderstood what I said and still wouldn't honor the groupon. The waiter had the nerve to tell me they loose money and don't make anything off the groupon. I don't think you lose money when you charged me $9 for rice and a pork chop. Or $9 for noodles and broth. Our bill was well over $70. Not honoring something on your mistake will exclude my business in the future. Apparently future profit is not considered in the equation. I literally live right behind there. I'll continue with Pho Eden who has always appreciated my business and nvr gave me any problems as a paying customer.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"This very well may be the best Pho spot in Philly. I haven't been to all of them, but the broth alone in my Pho Tai was to die for. Surprisingly it wasn't too salty, which is something I run into at other spots in the city. Pho Tai is almost the most basic pho you can get, with noodles and thinly sliced rare steak that cooks in the broth so it doesn't get too tough. If I had an extra stomach, I would have ordered another bowl. I thought some of the spots on Washington were good, but this place 100% gives them a run for their money. I'm excited to see how their other menu items compare and maybe make this my new favorite Viet place in the city to get my fix. With it being very close to the movies, there's always an easy excuse to make a quick pho run.","stars":5.0}

I'm also \"one of those people\" who dip their fries in ranch, and their house made ranch is phenomenal!! A must try. Their fries are better than most & seasoned to perfection!

When I hesitated, she said bring it in, if it is really bad, and we will work you into schedule. I dropped it off at 9:45 Friday am, received a call with estimate at 12:30 and truck was done at 3:30 that day. Tony said the front breaks were completely shot, and the back could wait a few thousand miles (his honesty was refreshing, I wouldn't have known the difference). The price he quoted me was half the amount I paid to have the brakes done on my van a year ago. When they called to say it was finished, I didn't have a ride to pick it up, they sent someone to me, and drove me there to pay. Amazing service, efficient, fair, friendly, fast.

{"text":"This is more of an actual Mexican restaurant than the gut-busting Tex-Mex places I've (unfortunately) come to associate with the genre. Hubs and I visited on a slow Sunday night. We immediately noticed a Help Wanted sign in the window, so to respond to some reviewers who commented on the poor service, at least they're aware of a need for more staff. We were instructed that they were out of steak and pozole--which was fine by me, not being a fan of beef or hominy--but I did find it odd that they were out of their Sunday night special (pozole). Even still, it was Sunday. Stuff happens. The salsa that came with our tortilla chips fell rather short of expectations, but the chips themselves were outstanding. In fact, I'd go so far as to say they're the best ones I've ever had. My husband was irritated by the small serving, but hey, we didn't have to order it, and neither of us needed to fill up on fried corn dough. It ended up being the perfect amount, at least for me (I just let him eat most of them). Our chicken entrees arrived in a timely fashion and were delicious. The chicken was succulent, and the rice and beans were fantastic. Worries about another salsa, this time a verde, coming on my entree (burritos nortenos) were put to rest--it was great. Both of us were delighted with our experience, and we will return.","stars":4.0}

There are several BBQ options, including pulled pork, chicken, brisket, chopped brisket, turkey, and ribs. All of the meats are dry-rubbed and without sauce, except for the chopped brisket which does have sauce. I ordered the two meat combo of pulled pork and turkey. It came with one side dish, corn bread, and a drink. I chose the mac'n'cheese and was very happy with my choice. My wife had the chopped brisket and she devoured it. Our kids both had the pulled pork sliders with fries on the side. They all enjoyed fresh squeezed lemonade to drink. I had a tall boy Coors Light and it came with a free Mission BBQ beer coozie. If you like BBQ sauces, there are 6 to choose from on the table. We enjoyed the entire meal and four of us ate for about $35. We'll definitely be back.","stars":5.0}

Their latest one is in University City and with its location, pricing, service, and food quality, it should do well there. Their buffets are a cut above other Indian restaurant buffets and at $9.99 a great deal at lunch. You have both vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices so no one in your party will go hungry. The chicken makhani was excellent from the buffet as were the veggie pakoras. New to me is that India makes a great fried cabbage dish (patta gobhi). If it's on the buffet check it out. And for dessert I had a great sweet carrot pudding called Gajar Ka Halwa. Being that it was a buffet, I also of course tried the kheer for dessert. It was a little runnier than I like but the flavor was there. Warm and fluffy naan accompanied the meal. Service was not only very friendly but efficient (water glasses always filled, dirty dishes cleared) and worthy of a nice tip even though we utilized the buffet. Ekta has def found a home in University City!","stars":4.0}

We were the only table with out multiple children. Our waitress came over asked if it was our first visit to which we replied \"yes\". She proceeded to what I assume was explain the menu, but talked so fast I was not able to follow along. I placed my drink order (unsweet iced tea) and she looked blankly at me. She seemed confused when my husband ordered water. When she returned with our drinks I had my build your own burger for filled out. She stood at our table until I finally spoke up and said I had my order ready. She then questioned me on everything on the form as though I was not capable of reading and filling it out. My husband ordered a chicken ceasar salad. We waited quite a while for our food. When it arrived my husband commented that there wasn't even enough chicken for a chicken tender on his salad. I noticed there wasn't enough energy a teaspoon of mayonnaise on my burger. Then I picked up a saut\u00e9ed mushroom that had fallen off the burger but it was ICE COLD. I felt the rest of the burger and toppings ... patty was warm not hot and the bacon felt like it had been warmed by the heat of the patty. The fries were so greasy they dripped when you squeezed them I was I need of food and there was no server in sight so I began eating. I was about a quarter of the way through and our server appeared. She asked how everything was and I told her. She stared at me blankly then said \"I can bring you a side of mayo.\" I told her no thank you and she left. At this point I stopped eating and noticed my my \"medium\" burger was rather pink\/rare. A couple minutes passed an the manager came by our table and asked about our food. We proceeded to tell her the issues and she looked astonished. She asked if she could remake it and I declined. She did say she would take it off the check and would check to make sure everything was OK in the kitchen. She seemed particularly surprised at how our server handled it. We waited for our server to come back so we could ask for our check. When she did she very rudely asked if her manager had offer to remake \"it\" to which we said we had declined and asked for our check which she brought, took our payment then returned the receipt without another word.

{"text":"From the second I walked into Sullivan the other day, I could not stop smiling! There's something about a hardware and garden store at the beginning of summer that really verifies the changing of the seasons. This place is a never ending greenhouse of horticulture heaven. I perused the outdoor aisles for quite awhile and while driving away, realized I didn't even make it close to the end! It's definitely family friendly, with a complimentary popcorn station. There's also \"The Yellow House,\" a gifts, garden, and home accent little trinket shop positioned in the outdoor section among all the flats. For succulent fans, they have a huge variety of cacti products, including pre-potted assortments and air plants. The gorgeous hanging baskets were absolutely mesmerizing, as were all of the flowers. There are tons of vegetable and - my favorite - herb options as well. I love making a little cutting garden in the summer, so I picked up some dill, cilantro, and mint. I also grabbed a little citronella candle in order to motivate more evenings spent on the porch. For those with race day pride, they have buckets of checkered flags to help your lawn celebrate May in Indy - so fun! I honestly can't imagine Sullivan not having exactly what you're looking for to improve your outdoor space. I noticed a lot of younger employees and was a little jealous at what a fun summer job that must be. They were also super helpful, able to answer my questions and direct me to exactly what I was looking for. I can't wait to return.","stars":5.0}

Both sandwiches were loaded with fresh tasting ingredients. The fries were really yummy & had great seasoning. Everything was hot & as ordered. The employee who took our order was really patient with us because we had no idea what to order. They were busy & we appreciate how she handled our indecisiveness & she was able to make recommendations. We actually chatted up the owner. (No, he wasn't that kind of annoying manager type that comes by the table to ask how your meal was & really doesn't care...). He was excited to talk about all the decisions & hard work that went into the concept. It was cool hear about all the details that went into the project. All the way from architect plans down to the consistency of the cheese sauce. Although it may seem like a chain restaurant this is indeed their first store. They also bake their bread on site & who isn't a sucker for some good bread! I can't wait to taste more on my next visit.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"What a fantastic dining experience with some of the best wine pairing in Philly. Decor's a bit confusing, further complicated by the music (oldies, 1950-60 jams), but the overall experience is one that is worth experiencing! Must get: wine pairing (tasting menu is default) Meh: wiz wit pappardelle Missed: more food? I came here with the wife for my birthday on Easter Sunday and were seated to a nice romantic table. I love the flower arrangement and the little candle. As for the food, it was just spectacular, with a few items definitely a little more salinic than I prefer. My favorites were fruitti di mare (the octopus and the wine pairing - amazing), the morel and pork belly and then sweet potato cnudi (which is like the nougat of a the softest gnocchi you've never had). I was not a big fan of the smoked trout cannoli or the wiz wit pappardelle, primarily because they were simply too salty. Be careful of the foccacia bread, it's heavy, salty, and buttery, not meant for the light of heart. Overall, what sold the place was the amazing wine pairing (I hear they have a sommelier), the unique take of classic Italian cuisine and the generous servings of dessert. If I had to be super picky, it'd be that the service is not to a Michelin level yet, but that's room for improvement. Food: 4-5 stars Price: $$$, but worth it Service: 4 stars Ambiance: 3-4 stars, the music didn't vibe with the ambiance.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Not exactly the best experience. I went here because I was off work and needed my nails done and the place I go to down the street is closed on Tuesdays. My choice to go here was purely convenience. I went in for a pedicure and a full acrylic set. I walked in at 11:05 and left at 1:10. Almost everyone in there seemed miserable or just generally blah. I usually enjoy going in and visiting with people here and there but that's not this atmosphere at all, but maybe that's your thing. ;) Each service took an hour and I still left with nail glue on my hand. The man who seemed to maybe be the owner was unkind and moved my fingers\/hands with jerky movements and was genuinely cold. He did not understand what I was wanting at all and talked to me as though I was an imbecile. There's a definite language barrier with the majority of the techs. The only ones who were really kind and sensitive to the customers needs were the two young female techs. Additionally, they use this electric file on your feet that doesn't appear to be cleaned between customers, but I couldn't say for sure. I can say, though, that my feet were rough when I left--even after the pedicure with a sugar scrub. The male that did my acrylic nails waited to greet a customer that just walked in until after he finished a text message. There was an incredibly long wait for everyone after I walked in (I seriously lucked out there). Likely due to the wait, I witnessed two customers arguing over who was next for their pedicure and not a single employee interjected...rather, they just spoke loudly in their native language and left the customers to figure it out. Talk about awkward. I will not be returning here but I'm sure they aren't too worried about people not returning based on how they treat their customers.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"We go here sometimes to get a bite to eat cuz neither one of us are interested in making any dinner and we don't feel like going to a fancy dinner just cuz we're hungry. I am always slightly disappointed by the selection here and usually just settle for the 100% local grass fed beef, american cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato and secret sauce. The burger is usually just okay. I usually start with their chopped salad which has avocado, red onion, tomatoes, hard boiled egg and a choice of red wine vinaigrette, or buttermilk blue cheese, which was very good. I'm also not a drinker and usually settle for a cider so i can't really comment on the draft selection. It appears to have a really good vibe and they do tend to have fun events here, we had come one evening when they were having a fall festival which seemed like a good time, though i could tell from the kitchen staff running back and forth that the kitchen or the prep area for the kitchen is located in the basement of the establishment which the only access to is coming into the dining room and around to the staircase. i'm sure that the kitchen staff would appreciate access from the kitchen area however that is another story. The service is friendly though which perhaps is their only saving grace with me.

I couldn't understand what the woman was asking me when she held up the pumice stone so I just kept saying \"yes\". I thought she was asking me if I wanted her to do it because she realized that some people are sensitive to it and don't like it. $5 isn't going to break the bank, but I just wonder why they charge for a service that is standand anywhere else. Seems sneaky to me. My manicure was pretty good. The manicurist was careful with the filing and paint job. The only down fall was that the nail dryer only blew cold air on my hands.

{"text":"In some regards this review is a variation of a \"toss-up\" aka Heads or Tails. And the outcome very well could be dependent on customer service. In previous excursions to HD stores at various locations over the years and across the US, my experiences have run the gamut of fantastic (Heads) to Absolutely Awful (Tails) to Phenomenally Disrespectful (Lost the Coin). Bottom line for the most part is my perception is that Customer Service often is reflective of managerial training and support of local staff...and that goes all the way to the top of the HD Chain. (IMHO respect for Veterans often touted in their ads, needs to be more honest and more consistent. I'm not looking for a handout...just the respect HD says it provides....but only sometimes.) Fortunately, for this specific Franklin Home Depot and this curbside trip, Customer Service was a \"Heads.\" It came with prompt, courteous attention to my purchase and the process of pickup. The store had what I ordered on line (in stock) and they delivered it curbside only minutes after arriving and checking in (via phone). The process of checking is was a bit cumbersome, but it worked!

I recommend going during the lunch hours for the $7.99 special that includes miso soup (VEGAN) , salad, and a spring roll. I am not positive if the salad is made with vegan dressing or what the ingredients are in the spring roll, therefore I did not eat those.

Menu consists of the normal Mexican favorites without getting too complicated. To start, decided on the El Vez guacamole ($14) - a significant dollop of creamy guac served with a giant handful of crisp tortilla chips and salsa. Consistency is great; could be spicier but helped with the salsa provided. For the main course, ordered the Torta Milanesa ($12) - a hefty sandwich with breaded chicken, beans, cheese, avocado, and jalapenos. The breading on the chicken was a little too much to pair with bun, so mostly ate the interior - a crisp bite and very filling.

I went with the squid ink canestri--a dish I heard a ton about from friends who had visited before I did. Great flavor--a little bit of an ocean-y taste to it, but overall delicious. I had a fantastic drink that I can't remember the name of, naturally... it was a vibrant green and boasted flavors of lime and jalapeno, among other things. Amazing.

I heard that the Head Chef and Saute Chef both quit on the same day. The new chef(s) doesn't seem to have it together and are making changes to the menu that in my opinion are not for the better. What was on the menu was fine and the following you had was the proof. BTW...When I pay $13.50 for what is listed on the menu as \"fresh\" Grouper sandwich, I expect fresh Grouper. What was served was NOT Grouper. This visit was on Saturday evening at 6PM (prime dinner hour) and the place was empty. I'm guessing the loss of the cooking staff is taking its toll on them. Add me to the list of no shows. We won't be back for a while. On a good note.....service provided by Sacha was excellent. She was very nice and very attentive.","stars":2.0}

(Edit coming, wasn't told i could wait 5 minuets and tamales would be ready and in eating in) I ordered a pork taco and half order of steak nachos. The steak has so little seasoning that I don't think there is any at all. Over cooked, a bit dry. The chips are good, cheese sauce ok, black beans neither add or give to this dish, just there. Not very good nachos. The pork taco was pretty good. I had to scrape out a ton of cilantro because it always tastes like soap to me. The tortilla was great, the pork was moist, tasted great with the fresh lime juice. So because the nachos were not going to be finished right now and fresh tamales were brought out (honestly, super annoyed I was told they were sold out for the night) I went ahead and ordered a beef in red sauce and a spicy chicken chipotle. Beef in red sauce is always my stand by here, it's good. The beef is flavorful and juicy, the masa is delicious it's a damn good tamale. This was my first time getting the spicy chipotle chicken, it's a no for me. Chipotle flavor can be hit or miss and this is a miss for me. Overall, eh.

When we checked out, I was told that if I made a reservation through a travel website such as Expedia, the parking is $30. What the heck!

He explained my options, but felt that it would probably be better for my Eleanor if I brought her in for him to try and induce vomiting. We were within the time window where that option might work and so we rushed right over. When we arrived both Darci and Dr. Siva were ready and waiting. They rushed Eleanor back to a procedure room just after seating us in their bright yet comfortable waiting room. We were told up front how much the actual procedure would be and weren't thrown any curve balls. Dr. Siva was successful in the attempt to retrieve the headband without surgery and treated us and our puppy like family. We were given financial options to pay if we didn't want to pay cash up front with 0% interest options.

These rankings, just like US News reports, have a good amount of politics. This restaurant looks like an early 90s Holiday Inn Lounge with overpriced Chinese food that I can get in Chinatown for half the price any day. Clearly, this is a place for people who never had 'real' Chinese food. I had their Chef's Surprise meal. Decent deal for their overpriced menu. $36 per person, 2 person minimum Starter: Appetizer sampler of Veggie Spring Roll, Coconut Shrimp and Meat Wonton. Coconut Shrimp was pan seared which was (slightly) different and served with extremely potent horseradish dipping sauce. Others were pretty standard. It came with an asian pear salad which was very good. (So simple! Asian Pear, olive oil, rice wine vinegar, salt, microgreens) haha... these chefs are gonna hunt me down for giving away their secrets. I can't help that I have a good palate. Soup: Standard Seafood soup with corn. Dinner: (2 entrees! Filet Mignon with Basil Sauce The star of the night. Delicious!! I wish they didn't kill the meat, though, it was slightly tough, which is a shame. Would have liked it medium rare. Soft Shell Crab, Hong Kong Style served with garlic noodles. Crab was good.. breaded and deepfried with seasalt and cracked black pepper (how could it not be?). Noodles were overdone. Dessert: AWESOME! each person received 3 mini desserts: Chocolate hazelnut cake, which was my favorite, Lemon mousse tart, and Tiramisu. My friend and I took it to go because we were too full at this point. You get a Dark chocolate fortune-cookie to end the meal. So, overall the place has pretty solid food with a some added flair that Americans like. Not the best Chinese food meal I've ever eaten in my life.

I chose the chopped brisket, pulled chicken, and pork and added a jalape\u00f1o sausage link, followed by my sides of coleslaw, Mac n cheese, and corn casserole. The meat was cooked deliciously and was not dry at all. I really liked the honey jalape\u00f1o sauce that they offer to top on my chicken, and the coleslaw went nicely with the pork. The brisket was juicy and flavorful enough to not need any sauces. I really liked the macaroni, but wish that it would've been a little cheesier. The coleslaw was really flavorful and not \"wet\", as a lot of coleslaw tends to be, and I actually really liked the cilantro and diced tomatoes that were featured in it. The corn casserole is AMAZING! Definitely a must try. It is very sweet, almost a dessert, but the flavor is incredible! I was also given a piece of jalape\u00f1o cornbread, which was flavorful and not dry.

The decor is adorable! Our server was sweet. Unfortunately the experience of listening to the servers and kitchen staff cussing as we are sitting feet away with a child, talking badly about their tables outside out of hearing distance, and speaking about leaving guns around and shooting people\/themselves was not a good one. On top of that, a young man who worked there was walking back and forth talking to someone on his phone through his headphones. Even better, they brought out my boyfriend's breakfast burger cooked like a hockey puck. My child's apple pancakes were fine, but absolutely NOT apple butter. They chose to not bring my food out at all. Being that we could hear everything being said in the kitchen, I heard a cook saying he hadn't even started it because he didn't have any sliced mushroom. Strange. 10 minutes pass & I finally got my omelet which just had some cold slices of mushrooms on top, tasted like it was cooked in a pan with meat, and cold hash browns.

{"text":"Wow, Completely hated this place, not sure where to start. Then food was way below average and so overpriced for the quality. The interior was high end decorated, so I expected same of the food. I ate at the bar. The bartender was awful, the beer pour was spilling over a ton when he set it down, didn't wipe it off, so went all over the counter and he just left it like that. Things just went down hill. Next I got a the potato soup, but they forgot to add the bacon and cheese to it, so brought out those sides 10mins later when I was done with it. I got the rib eye sandwich and baked potato as a side, the meat was very cheap in it and the sandwich expensive. The backed potato was tiny and overcooked, not sure how they found one this small. For this price I had much higher expectations. On plus side the stout I tried was pretty good, perhaps this place should just ditch the food and only serve beer.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Please note this review is for the River Rd. location and the appointment scheduler, Derrick. Today I had a follow up appointment with my orthopedic physician to review my MRI and arthogram results that were performed after I dislocated my shoulder. I was thrilled that he released me to PT and that my rotator cuff was intact and I could start working on getting my shoulder stronger and that I could finally get KT tape applied to my shoulder by a professional instead of my poor husband having to do it while watching a You Tube video. I was provided a list of PT providers contracted with my insurance. When I read the excellent reviews of Agility and that they offered the services that I needed I was very pleased. I called to schedule an appointment and when I spoke with Derrick, I was stunned to learn that Agility will not schedule a new patient appointment until they have spoken with your insurance even though they are a contracted provider for my insurance and no prior authorization is required, I have a physician's order and I had already verified my PT coverage with my insurance. Derrick was snarky and patronizing. I called back and asked to speak with the office manager and was informed that she was not available. He did not offer to allow me to leave a message or have her call me when she was available. He went into a rude inappropriate explanation informing me that many of their patients cannot afford their services and that is why he cannot schedule an appointment until he speaks with my insurance company???? Really??? I asked him if he would like run a credit report, background check and employer verification since he was acting as if I was indigent, malingering and in arrears with my bills. He called back and informed me that he had spoken with my insurance and could now schedule an appointment and told me my co-pay amount which I already know as it is on my insurance website and on my insurance card ---- duh. He scheduled me for an appointment on the 23rd and never gave me a time, which I didn't realize until afterwards. He offered to schedule my appointments for the next 6 weeks which I declined. I am willing to go for one visit and see how I am treated by the therapists and other staff, but I will not schedule 6 weeks of appointments until I know for sure that I am pleased with their services.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I was just in New Orleans for NOLA 2018 and got in contact with Aart accent and spoke to Kyle over the phone about wanting to do a complex piece. He worked with me until I arrived in New Orleans designing it so by the time I got there it was drawn up, ready to go and his drawing was better then I could have expected. My tattoo took about 10 hours over two sittings and by the time it was done, I'm just so blown away by Kyle's work. The details, lines, the look, everything is so perfect I'm still so blown away by it every time I look at it, not to mention the amount of compliments I get every time people see my tattoo. I never knew of Aart accent or Kyle before neither had I ever been to New Orleans and I can say they went above and beyond my expectations. It was so well done that two friends of mine came in for tattoos right after that.Whether you live in the city or just visiting, go there and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

{"text":"Spending a loverly Saturday in Santa Barbara, we never know exactly what we will do (though beach and Crush Cafe are always a given) We decided to see if there was anywhere we thought dinner worthy and my husband actually found this place. I took one look at the pictures on yelp and said \"absolutely we must go to here!\" Mesa Verde did not disappoint. We ordered so much. Starting with the grilled housemade sourdough with spanish manchego, english pea, strawberry, and black olive. It was so beautifully displayed I almost couldn't eat it. Just kidding, I devoured it. It was so fresh and delicious. The sourdough was out of this world and the strawberries gave the perfect sweetness to this sour\/salty\/savory dish. All around, a very great start to the meal. Next up were the picadillo empanadas with cashew cheese, cacao black beans, chimichurri, harissa, and pickled savoy cabbage and carrots. These were equally phenomenal as the starter. The crisp of the empanada casing and the depth of flavor from the cacao black beans made this a fully deep flavored dish. We got a special of the day which was sweet potatoes 3 ways. They were mashed, topped with some roasted, topped with some chips. This was delicious of course. The mashed were some of the best I've ever had. Last for the savory dishes we had the street taco with cacao black bean, jackfruit 'chorizo', blueberry chipotle salsa, caramelized onion, heirloom tomato, sumac, and jalapeno onion slaw. These were solid, beautiful, and tasty. They were, however, my least favorite of the 4 dishes. But everything was so delicious, I'm really just being picky so I can say I had a favorite and a least favorite. Nothing was wrong with anything that we ordered here! Now for dessert! We had the cheesecake and the baklava. Oh. Em. Gee. Now, I am not a big fan of cheesecake, but my husband loves it. Of course this is cashew cheesecake (it's vegan) so this was a whole other story. So creamy. So full of flavor. Pecan. Yellow Corn Crust. Peaches. Basil. Need I say more? Ok...I'll talk about the Baklava - or as they call it: Baklaca. It is served with vanilla ice cream, pomegranate molasses, pistachio, mint, sumac, and it will make you stretch your arms back, push back you seat, and say \"wow, that was the best meal I have had in a long time.\" Mesa Verde: we shall meet again.","stars":5.0}

I didn't think there was anything they could do about my problem but I wanted to alert them to the issue so that another customer wouldn't have the same problem. MJ politely interrupted me and said \"No, there is something I can do. I can send you two pounds of pralines properly boxed so you won't have disappointed friends.\" Imagine a store sending a customer $60 worth of premium pralines plus footing the FedEx postage completely unasked for?!?!

We decided to share a dry aged bone in rib eye, my favorite steak, with horseradish mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus as sides. The asparagus was delicious but the potatoes were dry not at all creamy. But the real disappointment was the steak. The first bite the flavor was delicious but so tough I had to chew and chew and chew trying to break it down enough to swallow it, when the waiter came finally came to check on us I was completely disgusted with steak. We told him how tough the steak was and he started giving a bunch of excuses instead of offering to get us something else, He did tell the manager who finally came over to talk to us, also making excuses and did offer to take half off the price of the steak and take of the mashed potatoes, She even offered us a free dessert, I declined the free dessert but my lady friend took a slice of cheese cake to go. I let her take the steak home to her dog. I hope he can chew that meat that cost me $29.50 at half price. Bottom line, NOT what I would call a FIVE STAR steakhouse.

{"text":"Philadelphia is known as a city of neighborhoods with good reason. There are many small enclaves with their own identity and distinct character with residents fiercely proud of where they come from. One of the best aspects of this street by street, hood by hood, awareness, especially from a Yelp perspective, is the presence of wonderful local shops, bars, and restaurants that maintain that sense of community every day of the week. Tate's Good Food Restaurant on Torresdale Avenue, in this corner of the city that shares the name, is one such iconic luncheonette that serves both the gastronomic needs of the area, and supports the people with quality breakfasts and lunches and a place to gather and commune together (shoot the sh*t). It is replete with folks who have lived nearby for generations, and frequent this small institution regularly. Yes. Everyone knows your name. With this in mind, I stopped in for breakfast and took in the deep rooted atmosphere of this iconic establishment. I sat on a spinner along the counter, after checking out the tables on the opposite wall. A solo diner, I did not want to take up that much space, and after all, this was what a stool was for. Within seconds, I was called, \"Babe,\" by one of the servers working the counter and floor, and, \"Sweetie,\" by another, as she asked if I wanted coffee. She replied when I asked if she was talking to me - \"Whatever works, right, Babe?\" \"That's cool. I just didn't want the other guys at the counter to get jealous.\" With that, one of those old dudes looked over at me with a stern gaze, and retorted, \"She WAS talking to me, but, I don't mind if you thought it was you.\" Wink I knew I was in the heart of Philly. The menu was all about breakfast and lunch (they close around 2). I went with the french toast, a side of corned beef hash and java. It arrived about 10 minutes later on an oval plate, with the hash on a second dish. I moved things around to get everything onto one before doctoring with butter and syrup. The meal was filling and satisfying. Six slices well egged and grilled. No real caramelization, but very tasty nonetheless. The hash was excellent. Deep savory flavor, a little crunchy. A great match for the sweeter fry bread. The Bunn-O-Matic brewed a strong industrial joe which was replenished as often as requested. A small glass of real milk per my wish to avoid the heavier half & half. Tate's is another of those classic kitchens from a bygone era that have survived and even flourished. It is as authentic today as it was in the last century. It feels dated, but that is one of the two main reasons to come to a joint like this - For the wholesome hearty grub and to experience a living cultural museum.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING! We made a trip from Baltimore to Philly specifically so we could eat here after we watched Chef Nok Suntaranon's interview with Jeff Glor on CBS Saturday Morning. It absolutely did not disappoint. I'm a huge fan of Thai food, but what struck me about this restaurant and is the completely authentic dishes. You're not getting Americanized takeout here, you're being introduced to traditional dishes and new takes you'd never expect. We ordered so much food - take a look at the photos - and everything was elevated, flavorful, and so damn delicious. I respect the fact that the spice levels are consistent and they don't modify it, so every dish has a ranking scale from 1-4 of spiciness. We chose level three and it packed a serious punch. If you're crazy (or a glutton for punishment), go for level four, but those who can't take the heat should definitely stick to level one. I cannot give this restaurant enough compliments, all I can do is tell the world how much I love it - so make a reservation!","stars":5.0}

Steak and pasta, not really a great combination. Even though he ordered medium, the steak that he received was definitely medium-well, borderline well-done. Quite unfortunate.

{"text":"I wrote a review of this restaurant on 5\/19\/14. On 5\/23\/14, I received the following message. Needless to say, it does nothing to change my opinion for the better. Very unprofessional! Dear Shannon, I am the waitress you took time to complain in detail about. Let me begin my response to your harsh review. First of all, I apologize for the bad experience that you had at the restaurant, I'm not in agreement with the restaurant's functioning either. (that's why I left). Most especially, I apologize to your husband that is, \"never cold.\" Im so sorry about that! Now this 'misinformed waitress', me, had been there for one week with only one single day of training. As you could see we were short staffed: I tried as best I could to serve, bus, put in the orders as fast as I could, in addition to hosting. The 'womelets' were explained to me as just that, simply omelets with a different name. (That was the explanation that the chef himself INFORMED me of). You waited and waited, as I too waited and waited for the food to come out. Remember, I am not in the kitchen, right? I'm sure you know that though, both you and your husband were in the food industry. Imagine my situation, though I doubt you did that day, as I had to bring out uncooked food, wrong orders, and and orders at different times.It wasn't me, however people like you made the experience exponentially worse. And I almost forgot about THE AGONY YOU MUST HAVE FELT, when I was at the computer, \"for 10 MINUTES.\" Again, my first week with only one day of training, and with brief training of the computer system. As for my \"argument\" with my co-worker, there was none. He is my friend and the customer that we were so \"viciously\" arguing for was as well. Maybe you should mind your own business. It seems to me that you are a petty person, zeroing in on stupid things such as not remembering who ordered what. As I remember, I was very sweet with all of you and I'm sure you all saw the chaos of the restaurant along with my running around. As you said, \"lots of staff standing around doing very little\", is a very difficult environment to work in, and I find it funny that of all the things to complain about, you specifically picked the person that was working hard. Shame on you and your husband. My tip, a total of 1.77, was a huge slap in my face. It was disgusting, in fact, I wish you never gave it to me. You did not consider, probably because you were taking to diligent notes on my mistakes and that of the restaurant's, that I had an extremely bad day while working. I had to apologize for the chef's mistakes time and again, and I was overwhelmed with too many tables in too many hours. I have dealt with really horrible sexual comments from men that work there.

{"text":"Ok, so I'm either really picky or others are very easily pleased. The first thing that was a downside at this nail salon is the location and the parking lot. It's in an ugly, small strip mall on Kings Hwy... very busy, congested area. Also the parking lot is tiny, with about 2 spots allotted per store. Secondly, the salon itself is tiny. They do have a great polish selection and their prices were clearly displayed- a plus. Also, the man who greeted us was polite- another plus. The manicure was ok, the hand massage was way too fast, but the polish did dry quickly and evenly. Another con, the biggest of all to me- there is one older t.v. hung on the side wall with a broken screen. Even if you wanted to watch it, you'd have to twist your neck while you're relaxing to see it... maybe that's why they give you a neck massage while you're drying! Ugh, I have yet to find my perfect salon... or something even close.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I haven't been to a Steak 'n Shake in quite a while. This location is just north of Westfield Countryside Mall. The restaurant was clean and well kept. We were quickly greeted and seated. Their menu options have changed dramatically since our last visit. We just wanted some of their good old favorites: Chocolate Shake, Double Cheeseburger w\/ Fries, a Side Salad along with a large order of Onion Rings for the table. The side salad was surprisingly good for the cost. I would recommend getting one with your meal. The burgers were great! The lettuce and tomatoes were fresh and tasty. I love their shoestring fries! The only disappointment was the onion rings. They were crispy but the flavor was off and they had a mushy interior. The star of the show was, of course, their milk shakes! OMG! They were a bit thick but we didn't mind using a spoon. Overall, I had a great meal. In a time when there are a lot of hamburger restaurant options around, you should try out Steak 'n Shake again if you haven't been in awhile. The wait staff was friendly and efficient. By the way, two big old boys can eat there for under $20 and be as full as ticks!","stars":4.0}

Totally degrading of women AND children. Outside the bathroom, there's a massive photo of a woman staring at a statue of a naked child's privates. Her head is almost in between his legs. You CANT miss it if you use the restroom. All the children get to see THAT when they come out of the restroom. How disgusting and sad. I will never ever support this place again. The food wasn't even good. How can you screw up a Caesar salad? Tasteless and disappointing. Also, they claim to be portraying \"Italian culture.\" Recently I spent a beautiful vacation in Italy and dined out at every meal. Never did I see objectifying pictures of bodies or photographs of pedophiles. Italy's ancient culture portrayed tasteful nude statues, all of which were graceful and beautiful.

We're talking uneven spans of rootage on top of weakened, punished tendrils. So sad. She didn't: A: make me feel shitty about doing it myself for so long. B: expect that I belonged to her from now on. or C: invalidate my beauty prowess, instead respecting my considerable knowledge base of the inner workings of hair coloring (I have, for pete's sake, been doing it myself for 20 years.) So she evened it up with product that was so gentle and smelled so good I was blown away. Then she did a blow out and sent me on my way, assuring me that my hair was in better condition than she thought it would be from my fear over the phone. The best part? If you are a student with a Campus Philly card, Studion Teknik offers 50% off services on Tues, Wed and Thursday. I walked out of there so happy I could have cried. I started doing it myself so long ago because I could'nt afford such a high maintenence color so regularly. But now, I just may treat myself a little more often. I've been to hairdressers who insist on being in control. Nikki let me maintain my control and yet allowed me to relax enought to trust my head to her hands. And that, my Yelp friends, is a concerted team effort in the name of \"lookin' gooood\".... They're tops.

I went on a busy night last week, and it took about 30 minutes just to get waited. The waitress seemed like she had no idea about the menu and tried to cover her flaws with small talk. The food took long to serve. I ordered the Hot Pot soup and African Stew. I never had the soup served in a hot metal bowl, as it almost burned my hands. I assume serving it on a ceramic bowl would be more intelligent. The African Stew was stale, with hardly no salt. I read the other reviews, and it seems no one reviewed the dinner menu. I am sure the lunch menu is different, but I am NOT reffering to LUNCH! It makes me sad to see such a cozy restaurant have terrible service and food.

There's usually room at their large bar and I haven't had trouble getting a table for a small party without a reservation. Service is kind, friendly, and efficient. I'm five years, have never had a bad experience here. The menu is on the smaller side and frequently changes, but their food is always delicious. While they have unique creations I always enjoy, the thing I love about pub and kitchen is that I can always get a hearty, *almost* home cooked meal. I'm a huge fan of their cheeseburger, but have loved several chicken and pork dishes they've had on their rotating menu as well.

We had arrangments at 4:30pm on Thursday and she replied to my email to confirm that date and time. I even sent her links to some dresses that I liked, so she could get an idea of what it was that I was looking for. I showed up about 10 mins early (this is my first time shopping for gowns so I wanted to browse a bit before my apt). I was greeted by the woman sitting at the computer and she looked a bit confused that I was there..... I told her that my name was Amber and that I had a 4:30 apt to try on gowns. She said, \"ohh okay, she's (another bridal consultant) with another guest at the moment let me go speak to her for one second\"! Not an issue at all, I continued to browse the gowns to the right of the computer. The woman who greeted me came back with another woman and I explained that I had an apt at 4:30 to try on gowns. Both gals did seem to really know about the fact that I was coming in? Awkward.... Anyway, the gal that originally greeted me ended up helping me, since the other woman was busy. She, unfortunately, was nice but didn't seem very excited, or very helpful? I told her that I wanted to stay in a budget under $(X amount) and then she took me over to a small selection of dresses to look through. I understand that the selection is not her issue but I just felt that overall the experience was a bit unprofessional and honestly...not very exciting. I supposed I thought It was going to be more of an enjoyable experience. Since I did not see anything that I really liked, I ended up leaving.","stars":2.0}

The sides were the vegetables of the day and the lentil soup which both were good, nice flavor. The sandwiches we weren't really feeling until later on that night so they were way better cold\/room temperature rather than hot. I also had a lemon raspberry cupcake which I thought tasted really great. The food was good but not spectacular. I could have spent $30 at the grocery store and made the same meals at my house really. I like going to a vegan restaurant and being wowed. Which sadly we just weren't super wowed. But nonetheless it was still great food. The only thing we didn't like was, and no judgment on how anyone lives their life, the staff were very hippie which is cool with me, but our waitress was wearing a sleeveless cut off and her armpit hair was very long and it was a little unappetizing. Which maybe is why we didn't enjoy the food as much. Girl guy I don't care who you are, I don't want to see anyones armpit while I'm about to eat you know.

Tortellini with the red sauce was beyond (can't recall the sauce name.) A zip of piquancy, well balanced with herbs and just the right consistency. Cheese torts were cooked to a T, not mushy, with plenty of their own flavor. Wait staff was a bit over the top in friendliness. Probably due to the fact the place was too quiet for a Friday evening. Too bad. Because this is a very good restaurant. Eat there while you can.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"We flew in Saturday evening and flew out Sunday afternoon. Other than seeing family, our big plans were to have Sunday Brunch at Commander's Palace. The food was outstanding. The service was outstanding. The atmosphere was outstanding. However, it was hard to wait over three hours from start to finish for brunch, especially toting along a newborn. Food wise between the four of us : for starters, the pork belly and cinnamon roll was absolutely to die for. The pork was amazing. The squash was good but nothing to write home about. The turtle soup is an old classic which still rocks and rolls with flavor and depth. The bacon was out of this world good. For entrees of the sheepshead and pulled eggs Benedict were outstanding. In particular, the sheepshead with crab was extraordinary. If you're into whitefish, you'd be a fool not to partake. For dessert, the bread pudding souffl\u00e9 and pecan pie were also both great. The service was wonderful. I had my iced tea refilled probably 6 times. They were courteous and attentive and really top notch. They also apologized on behalf of the kitchen running behind. The atmosphere was nice. We ate in the courtyard and it was a little chilly but nice. Wish I had brought my wife a jacket. We had just a few minutes of jazz outside, but they were great also. We got there at 1030, and left at 145. That's with us paying the tab while we were waiting to be served the dessert course. We had to wait about 30-45 minutes after finishing a course to get the next one. I realize that it's a busy and popular restaurant, but that is a bit excessive. It didn't help that groups of four that sat after us started and finished while we were waiting. Overall, still a great experience and a fantastic meal, worth dressing up for and making reservations for. But if you're crunched for time (having to go to the airport or with an infant), maybe this place isn't quite the right one for you at the moment.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This is a very good place with extremely good service. First of all this is located inside a pretty large strip mall, so there is plenty of parking. However, it's obscured from the highway due to a bank and a restaurant in the way, so it is somewhat hidden. They also don't seem to have a website to check out the menu (which I like to do before going to a place) but this one was worth the blind plunge. The food here is pretty much what you expect from a sandwich shop, I ended up getting the ham and cheese, with roasted potatoes on the side. I've only been here once (I just saw it today), so that has been the only thing I've tried from here. It was tasty, on a bun with ample amounts of cheese and sauce. The potatoes were tasty as well, and would definitely order them again. It looks like a family owned business so it doesn't have the glitz and glamor of big food chains, but the food is good and the prices are definitely good. Furthermore, I think the service is impeccable. Probably one of the best services I've seen from a fast food shop, as the person (who I believe was the owner) was very helpful, courteous, and friendly. They weren't very busy, which I believe is mainly due to the location being somewhat hidden from the highway, but I think this is a very good place to check out. I would recommend this place to everyone, for the food, the price, and definitely the friendliness.","stars":5.0}

When I told them that this was their mistake and did not want to be charged for an additional Uber delivery fee, they asked me for my number, told me they would call me back... I'm still waiting.

I love the cheese platter and my hubby usually gets the flatbread or pizza. The salads are awesome too. They used to have this incredibly delicious duck salad, which I didn't see on the menu last time we went, so it's possible that they change it up.

I escalated my claim. They still did not contact me but 42 days after I ordered they finally sent the order after Paypal got involved, from Philadelphia to California with no ice packs even though I had cancelled the order asking for a refund. I only unwrapped the Roquefort which was disgusting sitting in a tan liquid. It all smelled so bad. I got a full refund thru Paypal. This company never once contacted me. I guess they thought it was OK to keep my $236.00, send no cheese and just ignore my inquiries.","stars":1.0}

But the food is pretty great. The omelettes looks so fluffy, you just kind of want to use them as a pillow. And the cinnamon toast, oh the cinnamon toast is delightful. Also, if you tell them you have some ludicrous allergy, they'll put a little Swiss flag in your omelette, which I find quite humorous. The waitress are always super nice while you're in there. You also feel pretty fancy. If it wasn't for the price and crowd, I'd definitely come here more often.","stars":4.0}

After this hotel was booked for my annual girls trip via a third party, I was horrified and panicked after reading the Yelp reviews. We actually tried to get out of the reservation because we were so concerned, but were ultimately unsuccessful. Was this a 5 star resort? Far from it! But the hotel provided what I needed - a clean room, friendly staff and a general feeling of safety. The positive: the staff was always friendly. The free shuttle to and from Broadway was a lifesaver. The room was very clean. The hotel is very conveniently located. The shuttle ride to Broadway was only about 10-15 minutes depending on traffic. The negative: the shuttle was not always exactly on time. The rooms need a MAJOR update. Wallpaper was peeling, paint was rubbing off, the tiles in the bathroom appeared 40+ years old. The AC was not great but did its job. There were some shady characters lurking around the surrounding areas at times but I never felt unsafe. Just don't walk around alone at night.

My husband and I have been loyal customers since day one. We would routinely order the same order- tofu pad thai, tofu drunken noodles, and crispy tofu and it would be about $22-23. On my most recent delivery order for myself, I ordered the tofu drunken noodles and crispy tofu and that alone was over $20?? Wtf! First of all, the noodle dish has jumped from $9 to $12 in the last year or so. I know the economy is bad, but seriously? A 30% increase? The crispy tofu (which I have to say isn't so good now that massively deep fry it) is $5, which is two bucks more than before. Really, did the price of tofu really go up 70% in the last year? Give me a break... And to add insult to injury, although I'm a few short blocks away, they charged me a $2 zone fee. The website clearly says free delivery with orders over $15. So what gives? I feel bad but I gave the guy exact change and told him that its because they obviously charged me a delivery fee when it is not posted on their website. Oh and the price they charged me for my dish ($12) does not match what it says on the menu ($10 +$1 for the tofu). It may only be a buck, but it just lost Circles a customer. OK rant over. I recommended Circles to dozens of people over the years but I'm done with them. Anyone have a better Thai place that delivers to East Passyunk?","stars":2.0}

Friday April 7,2017 a little after 11pm, I pushed my Onstar botton in my car when it decided to shut down on me in the middle of North Philadelphia on my way home from a friend's birthday gathering. I requested my tow and they gave me a wait time of 50-70 mins. I immediately received a text message that said my pick up time would be 12:26am. An automatic call came through around the pick up time asking was service provided I selected no. When no one came by 1am I called and I was told someone was close by they will be there by 1:13am. By 1:30am I was calling again and was told 20 mins. Where was the person that was close by? I waited 20 more mins. NO ONE. I called again and the lady told me 30 mins. Where they spinning me? What the hell was going on? At this time I became aggressive over the phone. I no longer had patience. I am 39 weeks pregnant!!!. 39 weeks. God forbid I would have went into labor. I had a friend who had another car constantly taking me to use he bathroom (because I'm 39 weeks pregnant) while another friend would wait in the car. Lucky friends were following me and they were around. I called again and filed a complaint but I got a ride home eventually when my friends just wanted to go home and so did I. I didn't want to leave my car stranded but I had no choice. They managed to push my car out of the street into some sort of parking lot. I was exhausted and it was no way I was going to continue to wait. When I checked my voicemails the next morning no one showed up until 3:48am!!!! I was supposed to wait that time of morning in the middle of north philly for a tow when I called at 11pm? The icing on the cake.... I have roadside through onstar and through my insurance. The next day my boyfriend and I caught a Lyft to my stranded vehicle and requested a tow through my insurance. State Farm used the exact same tow company. Statewide. Great. I immediately became adamant but my bf said let's just wait because it's the afternoon. I figure it's Saturday afternoon maybe it won't be as long as last night. They gave me 90 mins wait time, pick up time of 4:02pm. Of course no one was there by that time. By 4:30 I was calling. I was told someone was about 15mins away, stuck in traffic. I continued to be patient. No one showed so at this point I googled the name of the tow service assigned. NOTHING BUT TERRIBLE REVIEWS!!! Pretty much every review stated how no one ever shows. I called back and ordered them to despatch a different towing company, which they did. They took","stars":1.0}

Our server was really nice and quickly took our orders and brought the food within 10 minutes. I started off with the Salmon and snapper Nigiri sushi and the rainbow roll. Both were pretty decent considering how cheap the all you can lunch is ($9.95). I followed up with some more Nigiri sushi and spicy salmon roll. I preferred the raw sushi rolls to the cooked ones, they simply tasted better. The miso soup was OK and the gyoza were decent. Again try the Nigiri sushi and raw rolls for better taste. Don't come here expecting world class sushi, this isn't the place for that. Instead this is a decent quality bang for your buck kind of place where you can leave with a happy stomach. I'm giving the place 3 stars for the decent quality plus an additional star for the stellar value. Enjoy!","stars":4.0}

I got a flight of 7, which were all fantastic! I had to go ahead and try the Double IPA and Sour Wheat, which are not normally my cup of tea. They were both amazing. I will come back soon to try the food. Service was as good as it gets and the facilities were comfy and clean. You definitely want to include them on your brewery tour. They are not far from downtown or the airport.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"The service at this location is great and the pizza does not disappoint! The decor and atmosphere here are cool too. Our server told us that we could have a pizza with half Bucktown and half Western Edition . I didn't think that was something we could do! My friend and I always have trouble choosing between two yummy options, so this was a great option for us. The pizza came out and was delish! I'd been to other Pi locations before this one, so it was good to know that the delishness is consistent between locations! All in all, a great experience. The parking kind of sucks around here, but it's the CWE so that's kind of expected. There are still very few things that would keep me from returning for more delectable Pi...","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I'm very torn about Five Daughters. On one hand, their cronut base is amazing and tastes very flaky and fresh. On the other hand, the fillings and toppings are overwhelmingly sweet and deem the donuts a bit too sweet to have for breakfast. Of all the donuts I tried, the plain vanilla was my favorite because it allowed the delicious and flaky dough to shine through. The chocolate sea salt had a delicious glaze, but the filling was a bit bizarre\u200b and way too sweet I had to scoop some of it out. They definitely get all the points for quality and freshness, but I wasn't knocked out of the park by the overall flavor profiles.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"Had to share an experience we had tonight at Il Portico Restaurant. This was our second trip to the restaurant. Our first trip was for our anniversary dinner and the food and service was very good and we could not wait to return with our kids to share the experience. During this dining visit there were only two tables besides ours. I could not wait to return for Mother's Day Dinner and made a reservation in advance and arrived on time. Tonight we were sat in the dining room, there were 6 other tables sat when we arrived. Another table for two was sat after us. After about ten minutes we noticed they were greeted, had menus and had a drink served to them from the bar. At the 15-minute mark still no one had approached our table, we had no menus, nothing. I went and peeked around the wall of the Hostess and asked to speak with a Manager. The young lady (very young) asked if there was a problem. I told her my corcerns. She threw her hands up in the air and says \"I am not dealing with this anymore\" and walks away! She went to another woman (who later announced herself as the Owner and stated that the very young Hostess was her daughter) that woman asked what the issue was. I explained to her. She responded \"where are you sitting\". I took her to the table. At that point she berated us in front of other customers and recommended we leave because she was not going to be able to make us happy. Then she proceeded to apologize and I thanked her for her apology and she got very aggressive when I thanked her. This is Mother's Day and not the way anyone would expect to be treated. I also want to note that in the 15-minutes we were waiting we witness two tables sending their meals back and one table sent a cocktail back. We got up to leave (very embarrassed by her behavior) and the other patrons seated closest to us were calling me to their table to say how horrible it was what they witnessed. I then go to the parking lot and this woman followed us to our car and mouthed off the entire way. My son kept asking her to leave us alone that she was making us feel uncomfortable and she just would not stop. She told my teenage son \"this is my property you don't tell me to leave you alone, I tell you what to do\". WOW What was one of our favorite finds has turned into a nightmare! Please beware before going to this restaurant. You will be verbally abused and berated by the woman that claims she owns the property. I should also note that you must be 16 to be a Hostess in an establishment that serves alcohol, we also saw a young man much younger (approx. 10-11) working his butt off as a bus boy. I just wanted to share honest feedback so no one","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Patients be warned - do not assume that Eskanazi Hospital is there to help you - absolutely no information was given to my husband or myself when my husband came in to the emergency room about the financial liabilities one will incur if admitted into their \"Observation room\". No one gave us any information about what an observation room is and what would be done in this section of the hospital. Observe means to observe where I come from, but this is not what is done. No talk of alternatives that would be an affordable treatment were discussed with us. We were left in the dark on everything. We asked countless times if our insurance would cover the care that they wanted to provide, everyone smiled and said not to worry - $11,000 later in less than 18 hours is what we got for that. My husband was there over 14 hours before anything was mentioned to him, a very sick man, in a dark room surrounded by doctors and no family member present that the care he was receiving was not covered and would be all out of pocket - they had him sign a paper that he was unable to read due to his illness. Shameful beyond belief. We have tried over 9 months to get to the bottom of their actions and policy of admitting anyone to their observation area of their hospital. Nothing and I mean nothing but endless waits or people not returning calls, spouting of policies that had nothing to do with the questions we were asking all came to naught, sent on a full circle from one dept to another, repeating our story over and over and over, got us no where accept right back to where we started. I just warn everyone that the Patients Rights that state you will \"receive care and understandable information about your care and services before agreeing to them: and you will \"actively participate in all decisions about your care\" are nothing but a sham. I like to think that other hospitals in Indy would have better policies in place to help the patient and their family prior to admission and their financial liabilities will not throw them in to debt if other solutions could have been found - if not, something truly needs to be looked into here.","stars":1.0}

My husband isn't a fan of chorizo but he had thought they were good. He ordered the Cuban Monte Cristo with cheddar and double pork subbing the ham. I appreciate that they modified the order for him. I got the English breakfast. I wasn't a fan of the black garlic sausage but I don't like garlic sausage in general. The coffee bacon was BOMB! My husband liked too.

Only vegan items are gyoza and the edamame. That does not equal a meal. Third, the service. Still not great. Fourth, the food! Ugh. I ordered the brown chili rice, it was ridiculously greasy. Why? I have no idea, it was completely unnecessary. Then the rice was undercooked. Again, amateur mistake. The ahi tuna was over-cooked and not seared!

Beautiful d\u00e9cor, paintings and sculptures set the mood for what was to come. We ordered our lunches, mom liked her avocado burger, I did not like my \"beef stew\", was kinda flavorless. Our server, Angela, gracefully asked if I was enjoying my meal. When she learned of my issue she whisked away the stew and brought me back sirloin burgers to die for! The salad, mushroom soup & horseradish sauce were really uncommonly good. Our server Angela was superb, she knew the menu inside out and gave us a brief history on some of the paintings we were admiring. After Angela scraped the crumbs from our white linen clad table cloth, she surprised us with a complimentary birthday dessert complete with candles. 3 different hand made ice creams and cookies, presentation was very nice. This is a really great restaurant in my opinion. Mom and I say that because the ingredients really were top shelf and beautifully presented. We were most impressed with what went right and also by how they handled what didn't go right (beef stew). Life (and lunch) is rarely ever perfect, the true test of any establishment is the way in which they \"recover\". We will give the Grille another go and hope to be able to give them 5 stars next time.","stars":4.0}

Our waiter told me is \"really good.\" It was odd, 3 very thin cxn tenders with a handful of iceburg lettuce, a few slices of tomato and a large serving of marinated peppers. My daughter thought her meal was delicious and was thrilled to be able to eat chicken tenders at a restaurant. When we asked for our check, our waiter asked if we had noticed the desserts in the case and I told him we did and they all contained dairy - bummer for my daughter. I did purchase a spinach stromboli to take home (which was pretty darn yummy) , two soft pretzels (which weren't so great) and 2 sprinkle cookies (very very good) and 2 sugar cookies, which I hate to admit. were way better than any cookie I have ever made... maybe not my peanut butter cookies but seriously, they are worth the trip just for them.","stars":4.0}

Quick fix and they said it would be delivered soon. Around 10pm we called again and the customer care was extremely unhelpful they said they would call the store and have it to us soon. At 11pm we called again and customer care was super helpful and said they'd give us a refund and free cookies next time and said we will definitely receive the cookies in 15 min. Low and behold we never got them. No contact from them. Update: I know this review is getting long but I wanted to give this place another chance by visiting it instead of delivering so went in to the store two days ago. Three people entered without masks, and I decided to wait outside until they were done because they weren't wearing masks. It got hot so after about 10 minutes of waiting outside I went in and waited another 10 minutes for them to finish their order. The server was just making small talk with the customers (who were again unmasked and obviously not sober) and didn't bother to say anything to me or tell me he was going to get to me soon. 20 minutes of waiting and I just gave up.","stars":1.0}

BUT, he stepped from behind the counter to our side, bent over and picked something up from the floor and then returned behind the counter and continued preparing sandwiches with the very same gloves he used to pick an object up off the floor with. maybe it's me but in a food service environment gloves are intended to protect the food, not so much the hands. i think alot of people working in food service dont really grasp that concept. why would i want his gloves that just touched the floor handling my bread, my meat, my veggies etc.? not to mention once he stuck that gloved hand into the containers that hold all of these food items he's essentially running the risk of contaminating the entire tray\/container of food. maybe I'm a stickler but i just couldn't get past it. this crew needs to be trained on the importance of how to properly use gloves. i will NEVER go back. enough is enough.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Zavino is a newer restaurant in University City and is located on Drexel University's campus. I noticed the restaurant one day while traversing campus and decided to dine here with my girlfriend for lunch shortly afterwards. The restaurant has outdoor seating as well as indoor seating and a bar. The restaurant has a very nice layout and feels like a more modern Italian restaurant. I really enjoyed the environment in this restaurant as it attempted to make the customers feel at home with the decorations and pictures. The waitress we received was very friendly and nice which added a plus to our dining experience. My girlfriend and I decided to share a variety food options here to try a handful of different items on the menu. In the small plates section, we ordered the veal and ricotta meatballs. These meatballs were very good and provided a nice flavor. Secondly, we had a meat and cheese plate consisting of a specialty meat called \"Baby Jesus\", which I found a bit odd, and a cheese called Scharfe Maxx. Both the meat and cheese were very good and went well with the bread and seasonings offered with the dish. The only thing I didn't understand was the name of the meat but I don't want to get involved with a religious debate over cured meat names. Next, we decided to order their pasta special at the time which was squid ink pappardelle pasta and it was very good. I personally enjoy trying different types of food, so when I had the opportunity to share squid ink pasta with my girlfriend, I had to accept. Lastly, we decided to go out on the limb and order The Hacina, which is a spicy rock shrimp pizza. The pizza came to the table basically layered in salad which was an interesting display for a pizza. The pizza was good but it was very spicy, literally being one of the spicier food items that I have eaten in recent years. My only complaint is that we ordered everything at once, so it ended up being piled up on our small table which made maneuverability and space an issue. Either way, dealing with the overcrowding of food wasn't an issue as everything was pretty good. Overall, I had a nice experience at Zavino and I would recommend it to anybody interested in having a casual, modern dining experience.","stars":4.0}

It was ok for soup. Just not French onion. The burgers were great. Charbroiled and cooked med rare as we ordered them.

{"text":"First time at Lloyd and the experience was pretty solid overall. I went on a relatively quite Sunday evening and sat at the bar, which was nearly full with both drinkers and diners. The casual ambiance is unassuming and comfortable, with a classic-looking, solid oak bar laden with a variety of whiskeys, scotches, as well as other liquors and liqueurs, with plenty of tables for groups. Would make both a great date location or dinner meet-ups with friends, but also a good spot for riding solo as I was that night. I started off with a Penicillin (one of my favorite cocktails) made with a Cutty Sark base and a Laphroaig 10yr float, which ended up being everything I could want out of a Penicillin. Great balance of the smokey, peaty scotch and the sweetness of the lemon, honey, and ginger. Highly recommend. I ended up ordering the Steamed Mussels (which seems to be an ongoing daily special) made with pilsner, chorizo, potatoes, and cilantro, with some fries on the side. In keeping with the scotch theme for my second drink, I ordered a Lovesick Albatross a little before my food order arrived. This drink again featured Cutty Sark, and seemed to be a bit of a variation on a Boulevardier, with scotch instead of bourbon, and Averna and grapefruit juice as the accompanying spirits. It was a little sweeter than I had anticipated (perhaps due to the Averna, which I've never had before) but overall a very good drink that ended up pairing well with the acidity and spiciness of the mussels. Unfortunately this is my first review I don't have a photo to show of the food, but it was more than enough to satiate my appetite after a pretty light lunch. The mussels and broth were a little saltier than I would have liked, which is unfortunate because they had a lot of great flavor that became masked by the overall saltiness of the dish. The fries were a little oversalted too, but I will say that the chipotle aioli that they gave as a dipping side was pretty bomb and helped to mitigate the saltiness somewhat. Neither was so unpalatable that I didn't finish them (perhaps I was just really hungry), but I'm glad I had the sweeter drink to balance it all out. Despite being more of an apertif, I finished dinner with the Overlook, which was more or less a house Negroni (what can I say, I was feeling the Campari that day) which was made with Rittenhouse Rye and also very solid. All in all the service was good too; attentive, courteous, and helpful. I'm giving my first experience a 4-star review since the drinks were impeccable but the food left a little to be desired. I certainly don't want to write the place off based on one dish, especially with such great drinks on the docket (looking to try their English Blackthorn next time I'm in), so I'm hoping that it was just an off-night for the chef that can be redeemed by future","stars":4.0}
{"text":"We have been using Mt Airy Animal Hospital and Andorra Veterinary Clinic for almost 6 years now, and have been very please with the care our cats have gotten. The staff makes a fuss over all of the animals and the techs and vets have very good bedside manner. They take care to explain your animal's health and are quick to answer questions both in person and over the phone. Recently, we had to make the decision to euthanize one of our cats. Not only were they able to squeeze in the appointment before I lost my resolve (which would have been bad for everyone), but they were very respectful throughout the entire process. Maybe when the staff went home, they judged the decision, but I absolutely did not get that impression while I was there. Having gone through that process, I think it was the best decision we could have made for our furry guy. I read so many reviews of vets in our area before deciding on this one, and I'm glad I did. I've been happy with this choice, and I hope others are, too.","stars":5.0}

So we knew what delicious ice creams we liked and which flavors were new. You can order one or two scoops, and mix them. I like a scoop in the flat bottom sugar cone. Waffle cones are also available, or have ice cream in a cup. The servers will offer you a taste of a flavor to try it. I like anise, so the licorice infused cream with sea salt and dark chocolate flicks is outstanding. The peanut butter-bramble-berry crisp is Hubby's favorite. Salted peanut butter with chocolate flicks was rich. There are lots of fruit flavors, nut flavors, a coconut and so many more. Many are GF. The prices are a bit high, but the natural flavors are worth every cent. Some grocery stores carry pints of Jeni's at a reasonable price.","stars":5.0}

I checked their Facebook on New Year's Eve for their macaron flavors and headed over. I purchased a 12-pack for $24 along with a strawberry cupcake (delicious, btw). The standouts among the macarons: strawberry, vanilla, blueberry cheesecake, and pink champagne. They're so fluffy and easy to eat that I dug in as soon as I sat down in the car and only four remained in the box as we exited the parking lot. I'm not even kidding when I tell you that I was tempted to go back inside and buy more right then. I did have an ounce of self control, fortunately, and stopped myself. The sweet treats at this shop made for a delightful end to a hideous year. I'd like to return sometime for a proper tea in their cute dining area.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Went on Friday 11\/15\/19. First time going there. Heard it was a good club from a few different people, so I decided to stop in. I for the most part enjoyed my time there. Think I was in the club for 4 to 5 hours. Would have given 5 stars but even though most of the girls there are very beautiful, I felt like they were a bit stuck up. The whole time I was there only 2 or 3 out of the IDK, 20 or 30 girls there came up to me. Almost all the girls would look at me, as they walked by, smile and keep walking. Go to someone else just to sit and talk. I had a pocket full of money and barely spent any, cause they just walked by. Other reason I did not give 5 stars, is because the drinks are way over priced. $7 for a Corona, $6 for a Bud light, $5 for a bottle of water is ridiculous. And most of the shot or mixed drinks were like $10 or higher. Don't think I have ever payed prices for drinks like that before at the other clubs I have been to. Did like the free shuttle service. Picks you up to bring you to the club and drops you back off. Saved money on using Uber and didn't have to worry about drinking and driving.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I really hate to write this review. However, I think that it is worth noting. Please be advised that the one star rating is simply based on the fact that this dealership had a pretty decent inventory. Recently, I toyed with the idea of updating my current Lexus for a newer model. I figured this would be an early graduation gift to myself. While researching various luxury dealerships in the area, I was immediately drawn to a model that was listed online through Mungenast Lexus. I'd never been to this particular dealership before but was confident in the possibility of finding exactly what I was looking for price and model wise. Immediately after finding a vehicle of interest, I provided some basic information online stating that I would like to stop by for a test drive. After a few hours of not receiving a response, I decided to drive to the dealership. No big deal! I was out shopping, the weather was nice and I figured I'd add this to my list of errands for the day. Once I arrived to the dealership I parked right in front of the building and proceeded to locate the vehicle that I'd seen online. After locating the vehicle I was surprised to see that the doors were unlocked. Upon opening the door there was a manual along with other information about the vehicle. My mom and I opened the trunk, hood, sat in the back seat.... we did everything that one typically does when car shopping. Since there were numerous models to choose from (this is why I chose this dealership), we looked at other models and compared pricing, mileage, differences within the body types, etc. Keep in mind that this was a Saturday afternoon. There were others on the lot browsing and being courted by sales staff. After about 40-45 minutes my mom and I noticed that no one ever came out to ask if we needed help. Now! I'm not sure of the policies at Mungenast and I understand that no one wants to be haggled by an overbearing car salesman trying to gain his\/her monthly quota. It's one thing to be hassled by sales but to not be acknowledged at all was completely and totally unacceptable. I can guarantee you that if it were up to my mother, we would have left the lot in a 2016 Lexus but I REFUSED to go out of my way to find someone to assist ME when I was about to spend $32k! I suppose someone eventually saw my online request for a test drive and they reached out to me the following Monday. I explained to the gentleman what we experienced and he didn't seem too concerned. Lastly, I'm not trying to drag the Mungenast name through the mud but I will say that I expected better service. I won't say that I'll never go back because as the old saying goes, \"Never say never!\" For now... my search continues!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"We were on our way to Acme, saw the line, and decided it was time to give Felix's a try. Why we waited so long is the only question. Felix's is a long, narrow room with tables on one side as you enter and the oyster bar on the other. You can grab a table or just stand at the oyster bar and order directly from the shuckers if you don't want anything else on the menu. We started with oysters, then I had the Bayou Platter Sample, which is about equal portions of red beans, etoufee and jambalaya. Everything was good, with the etoufee winning for me. I prefer Acme's jambalaya, but Doug thought this one was better, so it's just a matter of taste. I like that they offer a half po boy and side of jambalaya, etoufee or gumbo, as this is one of favorite lunches and, while I can certainly consume an entire oyster po boy, sometimes it's a better idea not to. They were offering a tropical bread pudding that day with pineapple, banana and coconut in it. I'm happier with the traditional, but it was good none the less. This is our new favorite oyster house in the Quarter.","stars":4.0}

This came to a very disappointing result for us. I would like you to know about our experience to maybe better the stay for future guest. I hate to have to write this review like this but I felt this was unacceptable When we arrived it was very confusing on where to enter the property, with saying this we where very disappointed from the start....we had to carry in all our bags with us in the heat of the day (92 temp) which was very difficult. We had no assistance with our luggage after gathering our luggage we had to walk across the parking lot than across the street, than up 2 sets of stairs which was not easy for a small lady like myself, which lead me to drop and scrape my luggage (which is costly). With staying at a resort with your level I would expect at least a bellman to help with this process. There where NO signs to even indicate what door to check in at, Which direction go in or any sort of signage before entering the building, this is a important factor for your guest to know especially during construction. When we did get inside there again was no signage to let you know where to check in. Once at check in I asked if there was any upgrade & that I would be more than happy to pay more. I was told there was none & that the suite I reserved was all you had. Which was understandable. I did tell him about the experience when trying to get in & he seemed to blame it on the city for signage & no fault to the resort. After I was almost done checking in a older gentleman came to him and said thank you so much giving me the upgrade (this man was in front of me in line) handed him a $50 & walked away. This to me was very disappointing since I as unable to upgrade. I saw that paying the hotel directly must not get you anywhere you must tip the front desk instead. Once in our room we where very disappointed by the standards of the room carpet was bubbled up, mold on the sink, curtains ripped, rust on the bathroom fixture & a horrible view of construction. If you are going to charge $719 for a suite I absolutely do not think these should be your standards. This was very upsetting & my husband was ready to leave. I wanted to give the resort another try so we decided to stay the nite.

This might be one of the better pineapple buns I've ever had. My usual experience with these is a excessively dry, flaky crust--but this one was I think how a pineapple bun should be. The sugary pineapple crust was solidly set, not flaking off and crumbling everywhere as I bit into it.

{"text":"Saw the Gyros sign on the window and being a Gyro lover I had to give it a try. Have easily eaten over 500 Gyros in my life. Most in Chicago, but also in SF, SD, LA, Las Vegas, Switzerland, Holland and Germany, have had good and bad ones but this one was easily the worst I have ever had. The pita was hard as a rock on the outer edges as well as having black burn marks. Never had a gyro with crunch in the bread. The gyro meat was plentiful but was the sliced variety and was cold. Sauce was good but was from kronos so I can't give them credit for making it. Ozro salad was sub-par as well. Another problem was when we ordered, they said you get rice or orzo salad or your can have a salad with it. I picked salad and for 2 gyros with cokes it comes to $36? They didn't mention that the salad would be $6 extra, just rang it up. They adjusted the bill but I noticed after I left that they only deducted $6 and not $12. Oh well, no need to complain about that as I won't be back.","stars":1.0}

They were heavy and dry causing me to use up all my syrup to help get them down. I've made breakfasts like this before and why I wanted to eat out. On the up side, the place was not busy, (I now realize why) the food arrived quickly, and my server was pleasant.

{"text":"UPDATE: They charged me $1700 to do the work in these photos. I have since hired a company to correctly do the job. It was very evident by the three companies that came out to quote fixing this, said that Triple J Plumbing didn't want to do the difficult job. But yet they charged for it, and didn't even connect the dishwasher as they quoted. If you hire this company, don't be surprised when things don't go well. ORIGINAL POST THAT KEEPS GETTING ERASED... Left feeling that I was taken advantage of because James didn't want to do the job (cut a cast iron stack and reroute drain) that he was hired to do. After he was done, my dishwasher sticks out past my brand new countertop, because the pipe sits inside of the dishwasher cabinet area. ***He told my cousin and I that it would be $1700 ADDITIONAL- to do the job (correctly). This is the point I realize I was being taken advantage of. Son showed up the day he scheduled me for and wasn't capable of doing the work (no big deal). Office called to tell me that James wouldn't be out after all and would be out the next day (again, no big deal). ***Please note...the first visit, I paid $926 to 3 J's Plumbing to have a faucet, garbage disposal, dishwasher and reverse osmosis system connected (dishwasher was never connected because of a hose). The new garbage disposal was leaking, and it was determined by James that the drain from the old plumbing was left in its old position, and there was no way it would work unless he were to tear the wall out of the kitchen behind the dishwasher. Well, I agreed because I believed him to be honest and knowledgeable. So he was scheduled to come out, and only his son shows. He cuts the wall out and rearranges the piping under the sink. James can't make it, but office says he can come out the following day. At the end of that day, my dishwasher now sticks out 2 more inches than it should, and I'm an additional $776 (total already spent = $1701), and the job isn't correct. After he was done that day, and I handed his son the check, He proceeded to tell my cousin and I how much it would cost to do the job correctly. $1700 ADDITIONAL to what we've already paid. I don't recommend this company to anyone that is relying on honest, professional integrity in a plumbing company.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Customer service and satisfaction is horrible at Peake BMW in New Orleans, LA. The staff has a very dismissive attitude towards customers and are racist towards African Americans in my opinion. (I won't go into details about this on Yelp). The staff does not go the extra mile to try and ease customer frustrations. They make the customer seem wrong all the time. They NEVER have loaners available which in turn makes the customer have to go to enterprise to rent a car and pay out of pocket for that per day. I brought my car in, in September 2020 to have breaks fixed due to excessive squeaking. They said they replaced the front brakes, test drove it and the squeaking went away so they say. Got my car back and squeaking is even louder and consistently happens every single day I drive it. Brought my car back in this week for oil change, vehicle check, and brake squeaking. They called and said everything is fixed and resolved. Got there to pick up my car and squeaking is still ongoing and they witnessed it themselves and said they will fix it again. Why couldn't they just replace everything the first time in September. This place is beyond annoying. I really wish there was a different BMW dealership in the New Orleans area other than this horrible place. To say you have a luxury vehicle they surely do not treat it as such and the customer service experience is awful!","stars":1.0}

My husband and brother had the seafood combo in white sauce and they all but licked the plate clean. The wine was lovely. For dessert we shared chocolate walnut cake and cheesecake.

Today after we spent the afternoon at Tyrone Square, Mall we promise my three sons and daughter that they could have ice cream from the food court if they behaved. We approach the stand the woman said that they were busy and they weren't taking orders right now because they were so busy. she was eating her ice cream sitting down taking a break. Then when they finally said they would take orders my mom and my three sons went to the line to order their ice cream. My oldest son is autistic and when he asked for a Keewee ice cream the manger rudely said we don't have that, my son said this is stupid and ran away having a meltdown. My mom went ahead and put in the other two orders for the other boys and then once my older son calm down he came back and put his order in. The woman continue to be rude and would not make eye contact with my mom kept trying to look at me and my husband. Then she started speaking about my son and her language (how did we know she was talking about my son she pointed at him at me and her body language was showing she was talking about us.) When my mom who has been a customer service for more than 25 years of her life had pointed out that was very very rude and that he has a disability and was not trying to be rude to you. My mom was told I don't care. The manager asked for my mom's card so she could refund the money back to her. My mom said no it's fine I'll pay for the ice cream just please understand he has a disability. The woman said oh I'm not making you your ice cream I'm refunding your money and we're not serving you. I go over to the to ask why are you not serving my kids the women told me we have the right To refuse service to anyone. I told the manager that my son is covered in American disability act and you cannot refuse him service because of his disability. She told me they don't care the other worker there was a gentleman who just laughed and said we're not serving you. My husband even tried talking to them and they said just go away we are not serving you. I can't Believe how bad they treated us, my son who is autistic cannot understand social cues and process emotions the way in Nuro typical person do. when he had a meltdown over the fact That they didn't have the ice cream that he wanted he was not saying that that person was stupid he was saying this situation was stupid. my son did not disrespect the coworkers in anyway and when he was being loud","stars":1.0}

For starters, the service is very inconsistent. Some of the waiters and waitresses are absolutely spectacular, while the others were at the other extreme. Also, one of the times we were there, they forgot one of our dishes we had ordered. Luckily I was already full. The manager came over and apologized and said he would be taking it off the check. With that comment, I thought to myself, were you thinking of leaving it on?!? The food, however is fairly good. I would recommend the queso fundido with chorizo and the croquetas de jamon, both are very good. However, the guacamole is very hit or miss, and in my mind after the experience I had with it last night, not worth the gamble. Although it is prepared table side, the quality of the avocados varies dramatically and the servers do not seem to know the difference. The guacamole is very bland, and they ask you if you want pico de gallo on the side, which with most guacamoles is usually mixed in already, however here they charge you an extra $5. I will say that the sangrias are very good. And there is a great variety of tequilas. Will I be back? Yes, but only for a few drinks and the aforementioned tapas. If they manage to start screwing that up, then I obviously won't be back.","stars":3.0}

As time went on they got less and less responsive, and by the end - right before travel date - it was difficult to get ahead of them and get a response. The driver that picked up our dogs from our house was nice and a warm person, but didn't give us any paperwork in return for our dogs, and the people in Germany wanted to see paperwork from whomever picked up our dog from our house. Happy Tails could have also told us what terminal to go to, in Germany, to retrieve our dogs. They didn't so we didn't know where to go to get our dogs, and didn't know where they were which was frightening. Also, the crate\/kennel that they handmade for us, which was pricey, was not wide enough for our dog. She could not stretch her legs entirely width-wise, and she's a Greyhound and needs to stretch a lot to be comfortable. Also one of the latches on that crate (the bottom latch) never closed smoothly. We tried to get our contractor to fix it, and he couldn't make it much better. Overall I'm discouraged with the experience and felt it was more money than it was worth.","stars":2.0}

Coffee snobs and hipsters hate them, but I can't drink anything else. The only downside is the fairly awkward drive through arrangement. On a busy day it loops around the entire building.

{"text":"I'm also from the Bay Area so my I have a lot of experience in shopping in Asian grocery stores. Given Reno is in a landlocked state without a lot of local produce grown nearby, this place is probably as good as it's going to get for an Asian grocery store. Products: there's a variety of canned, dry and fresh foods. The quantity is low if you want fresh veggies or fruits. I only saw one package of taro leaves last night but if I were cooking with taro, I'd want at least 2 packages. They also sell fresh foods which i is my favorite thing to buy here. The variety is small - BBQ pork bao, mochi balls filled with peanuts and other items. They taste fresh. Service: it's ok. Every time I come here there's typically one person working so there isn't much customer service but the people there know where things are located in the store so they might not be able to show you the location of the item you're looking for, they can definitely tell you where to go. Price: eh, on the hide so for me but since there is little competition for Asia foods they can charge high prices. Location: they're across the street from the Peppermill. They have a lot of parking and are relatively easy to find because they have a large neon sign on the corner of their property. Overall, I come here when I need something last minute. I'll come back but am totally hoping for another Asian store with more produce and lower prices.","stars":3.0}

The hostess was ready with menus in hand, eager for us to come into the empty restaurant. Why didn't they have anything available when we called earlier that day? The food was pretty good. It was just pricey and somewhat forgettable. I didn't walk away from Mila with any desire to come back. Although, they brought out a root beer dessert dish to celebrate my friend's birthday and that was delicious!! Very creative and tasteful! And the service was delightful.

{"text":"The Ritz East provides a solid venue to watch an independent film in the city, but it is actually my least favorite of the three Ritz locations. I end up here when a movie that I want to see is not playing anywhere else, and I certainly can't complain about the diversity and quality of films that play here. Most recently I caught the Woody Allen flick, Blue Jasmine, but that is about as mainstream as the selections get. The usual offerings lean to the independent, artsy, foreign variety, and the clientele is always there to enjoy the movies. The stars are lost for overall venue quality. Even though this Ritz is ostensibly in \"nicest\" location nestled in the same chichi Society Hill enclave as Zahav and Positano Coast, it has an overall run-down feel. The lobby and concession stand are tiny. A line forms out the door to buy tickets. The restrooms have a weird porta-potty trailer vibe to them, though they are usually kept clean. The theaters themselves also leave a bit to be desired with squeaky seats and stuffy ventilation. The screens and acoustics are in good condition though, so they seem to have paid attention to what counts most. Bottom line: if you want to see something that's playing here you will likely enjoy the movie. However, it is not worth a special visit for the \"experience\".","stars":3.0}

Are we invisible? I wish I could say this was purely because the servers were busy-- they were not. I suppose joking around amongst themselves is of greater importance than providing customers with some semblance of service. The beignets were quite perfect, alligator was delicious and Bill himself was friendly... I just wish he hadn't stepped out because this entire experience was marred by his staff.","stars":2.0}

Nothing was truly outstanding or particularly memorable. The tomato basil bisque and pasta fagioli soups, the baked calamari and toasted ravioli appetizers, and the penne ala vodka and lasagna entrees were all nice. But I've had better (sometimes much better) of each of these items at other area restaurants. Nothing here was particularly memorable. It all adds up to a nice restaurant that seems reliable. Maybe some more exploration of the menu will turn up a standout or two. But for now, my memory of Moscato's is \"meh\".","stars":3.0}

The only plus here is that the staff (at least when I lived there) is very attentive and helpful with taking care of any issues.

One time we changed the account we used to pay rent the day the system allows us and because of their issues not ours, we were charged a late fee ($145 I believe). Seperate note, they said we had till the 18th of our ending month of lease to decide if we were staying or going. We tried to call, email for over a week and a half w\/ no response. They called us the day after it was too late and said \"we must leave by the first!\" Company calls us a few days later and says there's been a mistake you have till the 15th due to the family not being able to move in, though we wanted to stay originally! Then they send us a nasty email and call us saying they made a mistake and must be out by the first because a mother and children are moving in. We literally just bought over $200 in groceries and now we have 48 hours to move out by the first? Well we called complained they said \"sorry nothing they cam do, we need to be out!\" So we lost the grocerys, had to call out sick and it's been almost a week and nobodys moved in. This company will ignore you, not respond to calls or emails. But has no problem sending you an email that's trashy, unprofessional and simply rude.

I ordered the 'Classic Buddy'. A cheeseburger with lettuce, pickles, tomato, onion, all on a classic hamburger bun. I also ordered a small order of fries with white cheddar dipping sauce. All of that paired with a small fountain drink, for only $7. I was impressed. Nothing better than a good, classic, cheap lunch. The burger itself was huge... I had to cut it in half just to eat it. Even though it was big, it was quite good! The fries were quite tasty too. The white cheddar cheese sauce was just ok, but I enjoyed dipping my fries in it nonetheless. I could barely finish all of my food. I also have to comment about the cashier, she was just a delight. She was very patient (as this was my first time here), polite, friendly, and really welcoming. This place also has lots of TV's, which is admirable for a burger joint. Overall, I really enjoyed my lunch here. Next time I'm in West Chester and hungry for a good juicy burger, I'll be sure to hit up Buddy's.","stars":4.0}

I tried the quarter pounder elk burger with blue cheese crumbles and mushrooms, cole slaw, and a few sweet potato fries. The elk burger was beautiful, but dry and had no flavor other than the condiments. The blue cheese crumbles and mushrooms were good but they charged an extra dollar for each. The cole slaw was good at $1.79 for a underfilled four ounce cup. The sweet potato fries were waffle cut and served with a marshmallow dipping sauce! Super sweet and interesting twist!

We ordered two sides of rice and it was the smallest order ever. I think maybe 10 bites at best per order. I will not be returning here as while the food wasn't bad... it was a very uncomfortable experience. None of the workers wore masks.

They said it would take weeks, so your results may vary. I'm guessing the government already has me on a list somewhere so it was easy for me.

We weren't effusively welcomed but the waitress was very attentive and friendly. The cakes and desserts drew me to the car several times but i don't partake.

They have lots of interestingly flavored sodas on sale ranging from peanut butter to coffee. I tried the pickle flavored one and, while the drink definitely smelled like pickles, it just tasted like sickeningly sweet plain cream soda. There was no actual pickle flavor all, it was so disappointing. They also had buckets of saltwater taffy and smaller candies that you could fill up a bag with and purchase. I was particularly excited about this because I absolutely love saltwater taffy but I'm guessing the bins with all the candy that you could choose from had been out for a very long time because everything was so stale.

{"text":"Farmicia has been my favorite place to brunch in the city for a few years now. I've taken several friends here and no one has ever had a bad meal. The location is easy for this Jersey girl to get to and there is a parking lot right next door. The ambiance is very cozy in winter, and fun with open doors to the street in nice weather. Judge me all you want, but one of my favorite things about this place is that it has happy hour for brunch. I love their version of the mimosa, the Farmer's Daughter, and never leave without having at least two. The orange juice is fresh squeezed and has all the pulpy goodness of one you'd make yourself (if you were so inclined to do so on a Sunday morning - which I'm not). I always get their fresh fruit salad. The fruit varies seasonally but is never predominately melon like most places. Next, I split either the Trio of Spreads w\/ Baguette or Trio of Cheeses. This time I got the spreads. Yummy and fresh with bread that is out of this world. I usually get the Scrambled Tofu & Vegan Chorizo Burrito (I preferred it more when it was a plate, not a burrito). Today I went with a brie-spinach-and mushroom omelette which was out of this world. A side of tasty grits completed the meal. My friend had the Pressed Ham & Swiss on sourdough. It was her first time here and she stated that it was the best ham and cheese sandwich she has ever had. She cleaned her plate which was amazing to see since she's always one of those people who can't finish and takes half of their food home. Another great meal!","stars":4.0}

All I can say is, if you are anywhere near La Patisserie Chouquette today, stop what you're doing and head over there before they sell out! And if today won't work out, make sure you try this place out ASAP. It is also adorable inside, and they have a few tables outside, which was great because I got to take my pup along. Five stars.

Bar seating it is! If you remember this place as Kreugers and have fond memories of your visits here, don't fret.... It's basically the exact same place (with less sausage on the menu). If you're heading out to brunch to enjoy some amazing food, you might want to try somewhere else. If your purpose for brunching is to get a buzz in the AM without feeling guilty about it while spending some QT with a few of your BFF's in a trendy space, this place will do just fine!

One issue is that there isn't much in the way of air conditioning at the establishment, so when lots of people are dancing, it can get extremely humid and hot---especially in the basement.

{"text":"Well we came in here after the Phillies debacle of being on the bad end of a no hitter. Damn you Dodgers , so you figure you want something that has some octane to it to cure the no hitter blues. Moonshine shots, moonshine concoctions, and more shots was the cure to this ailment. So as we were getting our necessary shots, we happen to peruse the menu to fill a void. I feel in my opinion ordering from the appetizer section is a great way to go at it. This gives you an option to order more than one item where you can pick at things see what works and what doesn't. Our appetizers dishes we had selected were: Stuffed squash~ This was stuffed with shredded brisket , which was pretty damn good. I suggest giving this a try, you'll be impressed by it. Wings~ There were a few versions to go with , we chose to go with \"White Lightning\" as our flavor. The wings were good in size , it was suppose to be somewhat spicy but never had that kick we were looking for. Tater Tots~ At first when you they come out they are not your average sized tator tot. It is a deep fried mashed potato ball with cheese and bacon (not enough bacon) with a house dipping sauce. These were pretty good, I'd most likely order these again. Bootleggers still being somewhat new has some kinks it needs to iron out. The staff is on point though, making sure you're fully accommodated. The decor of this establishment has a southern Tennessean type of swagger to it. Little odd I thought that there wasn't a whole lot of country music being played, being a \"Good Ole Boy \" types of places. Our waitress Gina was there, very attentive, making sure we were comfortable. We also met the manager Patty who came to our table seeing we were a lively bunch, harping about the woes of the Phillies. Then there was Bruce, the kitchen chef, the \"Don Juan\" of the grill, who was wheeling and dealing great meals in that kitchen. He too came out to see if we were enjoying ourselves, if we had any questions or comments. Myself I think that makes or breaks an establishment when the staff comes and interacts with the patrons. They enjoyed our company they brought us out a complimentary Upside Pinapple Cake. Which by the way is a must order, rich in flavor, and sweet enough to make you do a shimmy. In all I, or we I should say enjoyed our time in here. I'd come back in again, now go in for yourself and get you a shot of Apple Pie moonshine!","stars":4.0}

Harrah's casino being across the street was a win too! My check in process was quick and painless (major shout to Lahrain who was super nice!). I was able to even get my room without waiting since I landed earlier than the check in time. Kevin assisted with my luggage and I must give him a shout out as well as he was super nice and provided some great recommendations on where to visit and what to eat. I was on the 8th floor which provided an ok view but I would've like to be a tad higher if I could. The room was clean and nice and provided a fridge but no microwave. My room was in a corner area so opening the door to enter the room with luggage was a little tricky since it almost kind of slanted so I would've preferred a room that was more towards the middle of the hallway. The decor in both the room and hotel was nice. Breakfast vouchers were provided although since I only had a few days in the city I made the choice to venture out. I enrolled into the Marriott rewards programs and was told that I would be able to get free WiFi and other perks which I thought was pretty cool.

The sales person was friendly and available for questions when I needed him. The prices were comparable to what was being offered at the big box stores. They offered same day delivery for $60 which I thought was amazing. The delivery person was very friendly and set up my set very quickly. The entire experience was just great!

Race street pier is perfectly placed with a view of the Ben Franklin Bridge, the Delaware River, and if you time it right on a Saturday night, fireworks bursting from Camden.

Call it karma, cosmic intervention, or divine inspiration, I knew we just had to go. The girls had what they thought was \"normal\", chocolate covered, and pink covered. Knowing they weren't the common variety commercial doughnut, I also got donut holes as a back up. I bought a variety thinking I would eat them all. Wrong. After the Maple & Bacon donuts and \"Dad disposal\" remnants of the girls, I considered laying down and napping it off. 3 down, 3 went home with us. They were a little pricey, but definitely worth the money. You can taste the love with each bite.. ..Except the maple icing & bacon covered ones. They were plain awful and made with pure hate. And yes I totally mean it, it has nothing to do with the fact that I'm going back and buying every last one of them they have left..a humanitarian gesture to rid the streets of these addictive morsels of evil.

{"text":"I have had Cuban food several times, in Miami and Key West, and I was a little disappointed by what I had here. This may be because this little restaurant is owned by a nice lady from El Salvador. I loved my fried plantains-so hard to find in the midwest!...the sauce they were served with, a mixture of ketchup and mayo...while perhaps traditional? was gross. The black beans were good but lacked the richness of flavor I have had in Cuban black beans in other locations. My entree was pork chunks which again, lacked the depth that I was expecting and were flavored mainly by grilled onions and their own fat. The rice was completely bland...just a pile on the plate to take up space. HOWEVER the pupusas and little quesadilla type things from Central America were REALLY tasty. My partner's shredded beef in sauce dish was good as well. Perhaps because we were here with a large group the food wasn't presented as it usually is. To emphasize this: the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. Overall, I was underwhelmed. The interior is pleasant enough, painted in bright colors and murals of the beach. I will definitely return to try some other dishes, but I wonder if this place wouldn't be better named as something besides a Cuban restaurant. I would love to see some empanadas like the ones I had in Costa Rica, and more of the owner's native Salvadoran food.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I wanted to take a moment to share my recent experience at Caf\u00e9 Madeleine on Mother's Day for anyone thinking about making a reservation for a special occasion. Back in January when I was looking for ideas on what to do for Mother's Day, I came across their website and loved the idea of dining at the Palm Piper House in Tower Park. I called to inquire and was sold on the experience that myself and my family would receive by booking for the special holiday. At the time the lady who took my reservation, said that I was one of the first callers to make reservations and took all of my information - this was a very easy and pleasant process. Fast forward a few months to April, and it dawned on me that I had not received a confirmation or phone call reminder for my reservation so I called to double check. I left a voicemail which was promptly returned confirming that they had us on the list. When we arrived it was cold and rainy, nothing I was too concerned about because I was under the impression that we would be inside the historic greenhouse. Much to my surprise, we checked in and were shown to an outside table next to one shared space heater. The atmosphere was dreary, cold and extremely disappointing. Maybe on a nicer day, dining outside would have been fine had we been given the option but not in a forced setting. I politely went back to the check in area and addressed the seating arrangement with the gentleman. I realized at that time, it was a moot point as the seating arrangement was decided in advance; however, I told him of my disappointment and shared my feedback. He mentioned that upon reserving my reservation, I was told that I'd be outside which I explained was not the case. How could I have been told when I originally made the reservation in January? And on top of that, when I called to confirm no one told me about the fact I'd be seated outside - otherwise I would have requested inside seating or possibly even cancelled my reservation. It was not mentioned once, not even as a potential option. When I booked the reservation and when I arrived I was lead to believe that I would be inside. I went back to my table with my family, in the cold and tried to make the best of our disappointing start. Our server was not friendly, maybe she could sense we were not happy being outside but none the less she was unprofessional. We started by asking for coffee, my husband requested a hot tea for me as I am not a coffee drinker. She proceeded to say that the water was only lukewarm and that she wasn't sure if that would work - we asked for the tea anyway. It never came, so I ordered an iced tea instead.

{"text":"I used to LOVE eating at this buffet. Not only is the food great (traditional Chinese food\/Sushi), but the price is a bargain. Well, that's all before I recently found out that Chopsticks was involved in human trafficking and exploitation. No wonder its prices were so low for such great food, they were making workers work for 18 hours\/day for $3\/hour. Quoted from the story: \"The owners of a popular Chinese buffet in Countryside have been sentenced for harboring, transporting, and exploiting illegal aliens after a Homeland Security investigation that began in 2011. \"An event that started in a foreign country. People were smuggled in,\" explained Homeland Security Public Safety Group Supervisor Ritchie Flores. According to Flores, Chopsticks owners Jenny Huang and Guang Lin shuttled their 27 employees back and forth from cramped apartments nearby. They shared 3 units, at times sleeping just inches apart, and worked 18-hour days, 6 days a week. Fourteen of them were undocumented workers. At one point during the investigation, the restaurant shut down because the majority of its staff were considered victims of the crime. \"We did the math. It comes out to about $3 per hour,\" Flores said. To read more: I can't believe this place is still open. I won't be eating here ever again, and you shouldn't either!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I attended an event for an organization here that was over $100 per person. It is not worth spending your money here. When we walked into the venue, security was absolutely RIDICULOUS and extremely rude. Kicking people out who were 21 and over, constantly harassing people who didn't even have drinks in their hands. They had 5 choices of alcohol (including boxed wine which was of the lowest quality) and one type of beer. They claimed it was \"open bar\" but they didn't let us order drinks at dinner, which was absolutely horrific considering we paid for an open bar the whole night. The space that we rented out was extremely small. We were crammed in their lobby and unable to even see the theater which we also rented as well. They also did NOT have cell service or WiFi of any sort which was ridiculous for how long we were there for. The food was another story. It tasted like it came from an elementary school cafeteria that was briefly microwaved. While also telling us to serve ourselves with plastic plates and silverware. The chicken looked like soggy bread, and the vegetables were RAW. While also making us eat upstairs and closing the downstairs so we couldn't even get drinks, unbelievable. For a venue that claims to offer many areas to explore, delicious food, and high quality drinks, they are obviously better at lying than doing their job. I would never go back here.

With my recent trip to the Gulf Coast (MS and Louisiana) I flew with them because they had the best rate for flights into the small Gulfport, MS airport and no fee for carry on. I have always regarded Delta as an airline that provides stellar service until my return flight last night. This was the worst customer service interaction experience I've ever had with any airline. My flight was scheduled to leave New Orleans to Atlanta where I would catch a connecting flight to Baltimore. At the gate in New Orleans I stood in line to ask the attendant if I could get a seat assignment for my connecting flight. She gave me a few moments of silence dazed look and finally replied I can't help you so get that done in Atlanta. I felt very dismissed and as if I was a burden to her. I'm not saying that everyone should be bubbly and cheerful but the sole purpose of your job is to assist the customers. As she announced zone 4 to board she stated that everyone in this zone must check their carry on luggage because there was not any over head space available on the plane. I was already worried I wouldn't make my connecting flight in Atlanta because we were leaving late so I highly doubted my bag would make that flight as well. We did not have time to take anything out of our bags because we were spontaneously told this at boarding time, and then rushed to board. Made it to Atlanta and ran to the train to get from concourse E to A for my connecting flight to Baltimore. I stand in line at the gate and when its my turn I did not get a greeting I got the same blank stare and sense of \"what do you want\" look from the attendant. I say hello and that my online check in states to see the desk at the gate to get an assigned seat. She quickly responds just look at the board. It would have at least been somewhat helpful to instruct which board she was referring too. The gentlemen behind me did not have a seat as well and he asked her what if we do not see our name. She coldly replied just board with zone 2. He and I both just boarded with zone 2. Way wait and possibly be without a seat. Made it to Baltimore at 12:30 am (with a 40 minute drive to Oxon Hill ahead of me to get home) and of course my luggage that I was forced to check at the gate in New Orleans did not make it.

{"text":"Everything we wanted out of our day! We had a small party of four women reuniting for a girls' getaway in Santa Barbara. I had researched various wine tour options and found that Dee Tours was exceptionally well-rated on both Yelp and Trip Advisor. Our tour guide and driver was Dee herself, and she picked us up in a bright red jeep on time at our hotel which was 15 minutes north of Santa Barbara. We were greeted with smiles and hugs as well as snack bags in case we hadn't eaten breakfast. As she drove, she set the mood with a variety of music and quickly won us over with her effervescent personality, sharing stories about herself as well as knowledge on the history of the area. She didn't just take us where she wanted to go, she was more than willing to incorporate our preferences for the day. She took us to four wonderful wineries with a variety of wines - Sanford, Sunstone, Brander, and Tercero - as well as a local olive oil vendor. Lunch was delicious - tasty specialty sandwiches in the courtyard at Brander with a bottle of sauvignon blanc. We had requested to stop by the Santa Barbara Mission at the end of the day, and she did us one better and took us for an entire city tour, pointing out her favorite places along the way. We were all exceedingly delighted by the day - from the wine connoisseur to the light-weight. She gave us more than we expected and we expect to be back for more!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Stick to the Mongolian BBQ & Chinese Buffet. The menu is not worth it. I would really like to give this place five stars. For a long time, I would just go to this place for the Mongolian BBQ and Chinese Buffet. But I finally decided to order from their menu, and I was quite disappointed with that. I decided to order from their takeout menu and my order took quite a long time. The place was quite dead, too. When I got home, my order was pretty wrong. Now I ordered through SB menus online, not over the phone, so there was no miscommunication. They had my order, in print, clear as day. How you screw that up, I'm not quite sure. I ordered the \"Complete Dinner Special A\" to split between myself and my girlfriend. I also ordered a side of steamed rice. The fried rice that was supposed to come with the dinner special was missing. Maybe they thought I just wanted steamed rice instead? Perhaps, but then why would I pay extra for it? It was an addition, not a substitute. My girlfriend ate the wonton soup and enjoyed it. The paper wrapped chicken was okay, as was the eggroll. Not great, just okay. I chose sweet and sour pork for my entree. I was disappointed upon looking at it, because there were clearly a lot more vegetables than there were pork, and the pieces of pork were tiny. What's worse is that when I opened it, it smelled horrid, like something had died. I tried it and it didn't taste as bad as it smelled, but it still tasted pretty bad. I couldn't eat it. My girlfriend gave it a go and couldn't eat it either. Extremely disappointing. However, the Mongolian BBQ is fantastic. I've gone here for it many, many times, and it's always delicious. The buffet is pretty hit or miss. Most of the time, it's not that great. Other times, it's quite good. Either way, I always limit myself to very small portions from the buffet. Save your appetite for the BBQ. The food is very filling, and you'll want to go back for seconds (or more), if you can, especially considering the price. It's a bit pricey, but worth it if you come here REALLY hungry. I usually prepare myself for it. Lol The staff is usually very friendly, especially the cook. Every time I've gone, it's always the same cook there. Really nice guy and great at what he does. The soft serve ice cream machine is also good. I would give the BBQ\/Buffet 4 stars (only because the buffet could be a lot better, although you really wouldn't even need it), and the restaurant\/takeout menu 1 star. But to be fair, I've only ordered from the menu once. Maybe others will have better experiences. I, however, will not bother with the menu again.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"We have been going to this place for over a year now. My toddler loves it. It is definitely geared toward kids under 10. My daughter is 10 and gets easily bored. They have several areas of play including huge blocks to build forts, indoor jungle gyms, pretend kitchen and grocery store, Legos, etc. It's our go to place when it's rainy and we want to get out of the house. Also super affordable, only $5 I believe or you can get a monthly pass. The only downfall is there never seems to be enough carts for the play grocery, and over the last year I've noticed some things need fixed or updated. The big light bright board has hardly any pegs left compared to when this place first opened, the Lego table is lacking decent parts (I'm sure kids have pocketed several over time) and the big blue blocks downstairs no longer have red balls for the kids to play with. There may be a reason for that though. I was happy to see at my last visit that they replaced the big huge (heavy) plastic balls on the center jungle gym with lightweight stuffed balls. I had noticed those things were a death trap for tiny fingers and I guess enough parents complained that they changed them out for something less dangerous.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"HORRIBLE, RUDE EXPERIENCE!!! Sorry, this is a long post... We showed up for our 3:30p walking tour at 3:28p with most of our group. The rest of the group showed up at 3:30p exactly. In full disclosure, the email said to be there at 3:15p but the tour didn't start until 330p. We were there at the appointed time and the only group on the tour. We waited inside the bar and kept a lookout for the tour guide. At 3:35p a woman poked her head in the door of the bar and announced she was our tour guide. The tour guide immediately said we were lucky, that she was about to leave since she had been waiting for us for 20 minutes and that we were late. We tried to explain that we had been there by 330p but hadn't seen her in the bar, or outside the bar, when we checked. I was actually cut off by her yelling at me and putting her hand in my face. The tour guide continued to berate and yell at us for being late over the next five minutes. It was honestly bizarre and we are positive she was on some sort of drug. Her behavior was just not normal. After five minutes we decided to leave. As we walked away, she called out to us \"I'm sorry for being so rude\" and begged us to come back. Her behavior had been so appalling that we did not feel comfortable to go back. After the tour, I texted with the tour owner and explained the situation. The tour owner sided with the employee who said we cursed at her. We did not. Also, the tour owner said there was a witness who corroborated the tour guide's story. There was nobody on the street right outside the bar where this conversation took place. Our guess is the tour guide is friends with the bartender at the bar and the bartender backed the tour guide up to the owner. It was honestly a horrible experience. Definitely book with another company!","stars":1.0}

Fairly priced, Bubblefish also offers other options, such as smoothies, tea, appetizers, and Japanese entrees (bento boxes, udon, etc.). They have a decently sized menu for all items (pretty big for just drinks alone), but I would recommend getting bubble tea when you're there (the size is pretty big and most to all cost below $6). I have gotten the Salmon Poke and the Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box, during my times I am at Bubblefish and they have been fairly good. The poke was awesome: tossed salmon salad over rice and bento box was 'mad' filling.

A regular 8oz burger runs $13 but then you have your add ons which range from $1.50 to $5.50. Special burgers run $22-24. My wife, kid, and dad had regular burgers with various things like cheese, long hots, and caramelized onions. Daughter went with a pulled pork sandwich which came with cole slaw, and fried pickles. The burgers were awesome, cooked exactly as wanted, and very tasty. They come with lettuce and tomato, and the toppings especially the cut up long hots really made it special. The duck fat fries were nice and crisp, and the tater tots were beautiful puffs of potato. They almost seemed like fried mashed potatoes with a nice spicy zing. The fried pickles were ok. I also ordered the pickled beets which came with an olive spread and bread. This was delicious with quartered golden and red beets. Wonderful taste! If you like beets, you want to order this.

For the price, one would hope to have a large enough dessert to share. Also the last time we visited, my boyfriend ordered fried chicken, something he's done many times in the past and never been disappointed in. What he received that day was burned and dried out. It was a dark brown in color, clearly overcooked, and shouldn't have been served at all. We would have happily waited for some fresh chicken. This experience was out of the ordinary, however.

The endless special doesn't include extra sides - only 4 pieces of broccoli for $19.99. They also only allowed one shrimp refill at a time which means that it would take you nearly 90 minutes if you wanted to try all 6 puny shrimp dishes - Which by the way weren't very exciting. My daughter's child menu option of chicken fingers for $5.99 had a larger portion than my husbands $11.99 stuffed sole lunch portion which was so small I really felt bad for him! Literally smaller than my fist and with a side of broccoli - also a whole 4 pieces! His meal didn't come with soup or salad, either! We waited over 20 minutes for biscuits - they didn't arrive until we were half way through our entree. I don't know why we keep coming back...

I am very big on presentation, service and the atmosphere especially when spending quite a bit of money when coming to these places. I am a local and have came to dream hotel many times to bring friends and out of town family, etc. I had family in town for the weekend and wanted them to see the Christmas pop up bars. Especially the parlor bar at dream which is the nightmare before Christmas theme. We had a short wait to get seated. We were initially seated at the bar to wait for a table for 5 to open up (which was great, we didn't mind.) As we waited the older male dark haired bartender, I believe his name was Ricardo? Unsure exactly but he was the only male working behind the bar on the night of 12\/20\/21. We were looking over the menu and trying to ask questions about certain drinks from this bartender, who ignored us half the time. Once we did order, one person ordered the \"Christmas town\" drink which was supposed to be a more chocolate\/cream type drink. He gives her a drink that is far from what she ordered which once going over the menu, we realized he gave her the \"Christmas tree\" more of an old fashion type drink.. When I ordered my drink it was a simple spicy margarita and it was honestly unbearable to drink. I kindly asked if I could switch it out and the bartender ignored me once again. I then got his attention finally and he rolled his eyes and grabbed the margarita, (I ordered a \"monster under the bed\" it sounded like more of an espresso martini by the description..) he proceeds to make said drink and clearly is annoyed by having to do so. He pours coffee, cream and whatever alcohol in the drink over ice and slides it at me without mixing it. I then asked is this supposed to be a espresso martini? He looked at me and started to walk away and I said again, so I assume no? Or?... he then turns very annoyed and VERY rude says \"well it has coffee, cream and booze. So there.\" Clearly still not answering my question. I go to many cocktail places, rooftops, etc. when I go I always have great experiences. Any questions asked, get answered. Any drink swaps, happen without a single problem. It's not something anyone wants to do, however he made it 10x more uncomfortable than it should have been. I have dined at stateside multiple times and had drinks at their bar as well. I have always been treated great. Until this night. Going back to my friend who's drink was wrong...

The guacamole was the real thing and no weird creamy filler (as some restaurants add, which is a real pet peeve of mine). I was very impressed with the burrito, which was filled with fajita style veggies and Mexican cheese...it also came with rice as a side! The portions were HUGE, I had 2 full meals from the order.

That was irritation #1. Irritation #2: They were still \"searching\" for our car, which was a minivan. 30 minutes later, they're still searching for it but when I go up to the counter to ask for an upgrade ASAP, they all of a sudden is \"cleaning my car rental\". 20 minutes later as I ask for an update, \"oh, they're at the pump now with it!\" An hour into this horrific experience and we finally get our rental.

I had the stromboli. The flavors were good and it was a good size portion, but there was a pretty large oil slick on my plate due to the amount of cheese in the thing. I have had different things on previous visits: burgers, fish and chips, appetizers, ahi tuna sandwich, pizza. Most of it has been good but nothing has blown me away. That being said it it a cool neighborhood place to grab a burger, have a couple of local microbrews and watch a sporting event on one of their many TV's.

{"text":"The mental scars from our stay in this hellhole are still quite fresh. Here's the short version: we would have rather spent the night in a truck-stop bathroom, with our heads resting in a urinal. Here's the long version: The first room we were assigned was filled with rodent droppings; there were bodily fluids caked on the upholstered furniture; and signs of bedbugs. We left the room immediately. A woman at the front desk was helpful and gave us a new room. This room looked similar to an alley-way after Mardi Gras. It had obviously not been cleaned after the last few guests and had obviously not been repaired or maintained for years. There was: * Vomit on wall * Blood on the bed sheets * A dirty towel hanging up * Semen crusted on the chair * Clumps of hair in bathroom * Mold in shower * A dead mouse outside the door (in later stages of decomposition) Realizing that we could not stay here, we began calling other hotels and trying to find a place downtown that had vacancies for the weekend and accepted large dogs. To our horror, everything was booked; exhausted and in the midst of a cross-country move, we were forced to stay in this hellhole. Afraid of rodents, roaches, and disease, we wiped down the two wooden chairs and rested in them with the lights on; when morning arrived, we left immediately. We were abused at this hotel. Stay away!","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I'm currently completing an analysis of Almond Milk Lattes in Philadelphia (I'm equally passionate about tacos!- see my previous reviews). Gryphon has THE BEST almond milk latte anywhere I've ever been! Their lattes are very coffee forward, slightly gritty, and perfectly delicious. In addition... the croissants... Oh My God! I was meeting a friend at Gryphon one evening and (as they were about to close), we were offered 6 croissants each (for free!!). I ate them all before the sun came up the next morning. I can't say that'll happen to you (the free thing) but I can def recommend that you buy one. I am a current Teach for America Corps Member (TFA shares a building w\/ Gryphon) and I'm forced to come here every couple months for Saturday seminars... waking up early to sit in overly air-conditioned rooms is dreadful (no shade to TFA) but getting my 2 Gryphon lattes (breakfast and lunch) makes it all worth it.

{"text":"I have to admit that the concept of all-you-can-eat sushi and sashimi terrified me initially. I mean, how fresh can the fish be if it's put out and left under heat lamps? Clearly, I was misguided, at least for this place. For about $35-37\/person (including tax and tip) for dinner, you get to eat your heart's desire of sushi, hibachi, sashimi, and other hot dishes, in addition to the ubiquitous crab legs. The sushi isn't exactly Bluefin quality but you get to try some many more varieties and the chef is always more than happy to make a roll for you, should you ask. My dad, being scared to death of raw fish and apparently allergic to anything that is green or seafood-related, loves the udon station and hibachi grill, where he will typically pack away twice his body weight in meat and noodles (and believe me, that's not a very trivial amount). The hot entrees are pretty good, as are the cold salads. They have a dessert bar with green tea ice cream, but I have to confess that I rarely take advantage of it except for maybe a minuscule dish of ice cream because I'm so stuffed with fish and crab by then that they would have needed to pull me out on a stretcher had I chosen to indulge further. Come on people, this is a buffet so what else am I supposed to do besides stuff myself? I mean, the ambiance is okay but that's not why I go there.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Updated review: I moved from NY and told myself I would write a review once moving in since other reviews had helped me make my decision. I've lived here a little over a year now. The apartment and location: The apartments are located conveniently close to the Magazine street and downtown is only a 10 minutes drive. The apartment was very clean upon move-in. The bathroom is large, and there is ample closet space. The kitchen has a good amount of space as well - lots of cabinet and drawer space. My dishwasher is a little off the hinge so I've never used it, but I also didn't bring this up with maintenance. I also have a shared balcony. I did have a few issues with cockroaches - but it was always just a single cockroach in the apartment (NOT an infestation). I think they have pest control on board. I would say that, as a pet owner, the carpet situation is not ideal, however I knew this before signing the lease. The outdoor areas (grass, bushes, etc) around the apartment are also relatively well kept. However, there is also the occasional huge wad of dog poo that people don't pick up. The stairwells leading up to the apartments are a little dirty, dark, and dinky with stains (have not seen any poo ON the stairwell) but this hasn't really affect the living situation at all. Neighbors and noise: The neighbors I've met have been very friendly. There are the occasional Fri\/Sat night house\/pool party, but the noise has been bearable (I think it depends which side you live on). While I cannot hear voices or anything from my upstairs and next-door neighbor, the ceiling is thin enough where I can hear the upstairs neighbor take every step - maybe he\/she just walks very heavily. When they flush the toilet, the water goes through the pipes very loudly as well. Parking: Covered garage parking is a major plus. They provide a key card that provides access to the parking gates. When I first moved in, some of the garage gates were broken, but this has been fixed since then. There are \"reserved\" spots that you can't park in unless you pay for it. Parking spaces can be limited and the garage is a little cramped. However, there's also street parking if the garage is full. Overall, I have not had any major issues with parking. Staff: There is an on-site leasing office. I changed my mind about my move-in date a few times, but Beau made the paperwork process very easy. The office will also accept packages and store them in a safe place. They also email you when your packages come. The staff is pretty attentive and will help you with any issues that arise Amenities: - Gym - Very nice and clean, not crowded even during \"peak\" hours - Very pet friendly - They provide doggy-bags throughout the complex grounds as well - There is a business center where the residents can go to use the computers and print things.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here April 19th and checked out the 21st. We were in town for a friend's wedding downtown and wanted a place that was within walking distance of the venue. The hotels the bride & groom picked had some issues, so we decided to pick one out ourselves. The Hampton Inn & Suites was definitely a great choice. Check in took a while as the lobby was busy and for some reason FULL of children. I knew that when we'd go use the hot tub later in our trip that we should avoid mid morning and mid afternoon. ;) After checking in and getting into the parking garage, our key card stopped working at our room's door. Tried both keys, too. Went down to get them re-keyed and then there was an issue with one of the elevators - luckily I wasn't in it, but I got to see the folks in it several times. The system goes that you must swipe your card in the elevator for floors 5 on up; I think the folks in there didn't put a card in. Once in our room, it was very nice with a comfortable bed. All the usual hotel amenities worked great - wi-fi, the hair dryer, mini fridge, and A\/C. We would definitely stay here again since it is close to so many attractions downtown and the fact that you have in and out privileges for the parking garage.","stars":4.0}

We ordered our beer -- mine arrived 10 minutes before my husband`s (same beer). I presume they were changing a cask but some communication would have been good. Then the food. Ah yes -- the food. We ordered the `famous`steak sandwiches -- mine medium rare, his rare. Mine arrived rare and cold. His almost raw. I told the server about it and here is what she had to say: I don`t know what to tell - you. It`s usually really good. And then she walked away. She came back later to ask if we wanted our bill. I asked whether we were really expected to pay for that (the food) and she sent the manager over. He was quite apologetic and took the food off the bill. But that should have been a no-brainer.

I'll admit, it stresses me out that they don't take reservations here. I usually come here with a party of at least four on a weekend night, so the fact that our dinner plans are up in the air until we arrive to find out how long the wait is, can be a little worrisome. This visit, we decided to sit at the bar since the Final Four games were on and we were more than happy with the service we received while we were originally waiting for a table. Both bartenders were extremely knowledgeable about the food and were able to make great recommendations. They were attentive, friendly, and kept our beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) full! I'm ADDICTED to the Tartufo pizza but I decided I'd try a different pizza this time around, so my beau and I split the San Daniele, topped with prosciutto, smoked mozzarella, and arugula. It was delicious (damn, the crust is good!) but still only ranks second to the decadence of the Tartufo. We also had the arancini as the appetizer but it paled in comparison to Little Nonna's version, so it was a bit of a disappointment. The honey marscapone gelato is to die for. The olive oil version was creative, but not tasty enough to warrant an entire serving, in my opinion. I'd give the food three stars, but for overall experience it's a solid four. I've always loved the relaxed atmosphere and enjoyed the more laid back bar area even more. See you again soon, Stella!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I went to Herbie's this past weekend to use a Travelzoo dining certificate I bought a couple months ago. I've been wanting to go for weeks, and finally made it out! First, we were seated near the bar area at a tiny table. It was fine, and we could watch TV, but pretty much deserted (just us and the bartender). When the waiter came to pour us some water, he spilled it all over the aforementioned tiny table. While I don't blame him for making a human error, he didn't even bother to clean it up at all! So basically, our table was sopping wet the entire time. Strike 1. For our drinks, I got a mimosa (meh, decent), and my BF got coffee. The coffee was lukewarm and when he added creamer, it clumped up something awful. They were really nice about it when we pointed it out, and happily exchanged it for a bloody mary (which was not bad). But honestly, a brunch place that can't make a passable cup of coffee? Strike 2 in my book. For entrees\/sides, I got the chicken fried steak with an egg over easy and the cheddar cheese grits. The BF got a classic eggs benedict and bacon. We had heard about how great the brunch was, and were willing to overlook previous travesties for a good meal. Alas, we were to be disappointed again. My chicken fried steak was so skimpy on the \"steak\" (which tasted more like hamburger mash) that I kept looking for more of it under the potatoes. It tasted mediocre, lacking much of the \"fried\", as well. The BF's eggs benedict had 1 lovely runny egg and another one that was pretty much hard boiled. It was awful. On top of that, his bacon was so badly burnt that it was practically black! It's appalling to me that the chef let that terrible bacon leave the kitchen, and speaks to the fact that the cooking was hasty, shoddy, and not worth even the discounted price. Strikes 3, 4, and 5. The only good thing was the grits. I actually enjoyed those, although they were a little clumpier than i like my grits. I'll even knock off a strike for those. Overall, a pretty disappointing experience that I didn't think was even worth the 1\/2 off Travelzoo price. I don't think we'll be going back.","stars":2.0}

However, the waitress messed up our dinner orders. Everyone who ordered the Skewers agreed they were barely warm. The hoppin john rice that came with the Skewers was also sub-par. Also, if you ordered the Shrimp, Chicken, or Steak skewers, you only got 2 pieces of meat on each skewer with the remaining items vegetables. the meat skewers were the same price as the vegetable skewers, it didn't make much sense. Overall, the food was good, however, it was overpriced for my particular experience. i'm interested in going back, but im not sure if it would be worth it","stars":3.0}

I remember it being too sour, but I forced myself to finish it anyway. My friends took me here cause there's one in Portland, which seems to be the \"it\" place for this new food movement that just doesn't appeal to me. The interior is tasteless.

A lady brought my order to the table but with no drink, then she said, I guess I should bring you a cup. Once she did I had to get up from the table to fill my cup with the diet coke (leaving my food behind). Once I got my drink I was able to finally eat!

{"text":"Food: The food here is terrific (Asian-fusion, good variety, plenty of vegetarian options). All of the sauces are homemade - you get a nice sampling with your wanton appetizer after being seated: spicy mustard, spicy chile, and tangy duck sauce. The veggie steamed dumplings are delicious and made with house-made spinach dough. Entrees: each dish is individually and meticulously prepared. I can speak for the tangerine tofu broccoli dish, which I loved - crispy and crunchy with a little bit of heat in the citrus sauce. You can't go wrong! Service: This is a small family run business, and the co-owners also do all of the cooking and front-of-house themselves. Customer service was on point when we were there (but it was not very busy), but I think they get a bit backed up if they are also trying to fill multiple take-out orders AND wait on customers. This is in part because of the time and care they are taking to make each dish though! A bit chatty, but very friendly and attentive. Other: Alcohol is not served, but don't let that scare you off. The food is worth the trip, and the owners are super nice. The owner mentioned to us that they may be switching gears in the coming months when their lease ends, so try it while you can.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I've been here a lot of times since my last review, and I have to say... I'm losing the love. I tried to make this place my go-to after work hangout, but after two or three times I just got bored. I took some time off and tried again tonight, and I felt like I had to update my review. I finally had the pizza. More than once. Honestly? It was just okay. Maybe it's me but I cannot inherently trust any pizza place that doesn't just have a plain pepperoni on the menu. Maybe this makes me not a foodie anymore but I have lost the ability to care. I've thusfar had the mushroom pizza and the arugala and proscuitto. Both were good, but neither incited the kind of fire in me that I've seen other reviewers express. I also had the zucchini chips, which lacked really any sort of flavor other than oil, and the polenta with ragu. The polenta with ragu is delicious but I was really thrown off by the presentation, which consisted of two separate bowls and some sort of board and what appeared to be a short performance art piece. I understand when this sort of thing is done in restaurants, but at Reilly it just seemed superfluous. Just put the polenta in a bowl and bring it to me so that I can eat it. Don't mash it around on a board. I feel like recently the quality of the food and service have both gone severely downhill. As I usually dine alone, I often sit at the bar. I have a cocktail or wine with dinner or lunch or whatever. My first sign that something was rotten in Denmark was that they stopped serving bottled wine by the glass, and while there is nothing wrong with kegged wine Reilly serves their red wine way too cold, which really kills the flavor. I usually have to spend the first 5-10 minutes with my glass trying to warm it in my hands until it becomes a manageable temperature. I often find that once I order food I fall of the bartender's radar completely, whether the place is packed on a Saturday night or there are only a few other people dining with me. This evening I re-ordered my old standby, the peppardelle. At one point I had to ask the bartender if the recipe had changed because I was certain that I wasn't even eating the same dish. There were (I counted) three mushrooms in the entire dish. The rich, flavorful sauce that I'd remembered was just sort of a stew heaped on top of lukewarm, mushy noodles. I still love the atmosphere, the feeling that \"Aw gee look at what a hip place I'm at maybe that makes me hip too\" but I couldn't help feeling like some of the magic was gone. Hopefully I'll come back in the future and all will be returned to the sparkly hipster wonderland that it once was. I just don't know how long it will be - honestly","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Took my wife to Sama Sama for her first time. I've been for drinks a handful of times and had good experiences. Tonight was much different. We grabbed two open seats at the bar and ordered wings, French fries, and the rice\/ pork sausage dish.Wings were great. They ran out of fries and put in an order of potato wedges instead. My wife tried the rice and immediately didn't like the taste. She told the bartender that she didn't like the dish and asked to order a second dish of chicken wings instead. The bartender asked, \"Can you specify exactly what you don't like?\" (Because she would have to speak with her manager to see if it's okay to swap the dish for another.) This attempt to assess our concern came off as an effort to get the customer to justify why the restaurant should take back the dish rather than an attempt to make future dishes better. When she returned from the kitchen she told us that the owner said, \"Since we didn't like the egg, and the dish description has egg listed on the ingredients, they would not be able to remove the item from our bill but were welcome to finish eating the dish and order something else.\" Needless to say, we weren't satisfied with that response. We continued to eat the rice that we didn't like, pushing the egg to the side, and then asked to speak with the manager. Bartender said the owner\/manager was too busy, and we should \"come back when they're closed.\" (It was 8:15, they close at 10PM) We can clearly see to the kitchen that the owner\/chef was helping his staff clean up and could certainly come out to speak with us for 3 minutes. We asked her again to get her manager to come out, making it clear that we would not wait until the restaurant closed to voice our concerns. The manager\/co-owner Ryan came out immediately once she got him and we told him what happened. He explained that it was likely due to miscommunication and that if he knew it was the taste of the dish and not just the presence of egg, he would have gladly just replaced the dish with something we liked. By the time he apologized we had already paid our bill and left a tip but he was gracious enough to give us a gift certificate for a future visit. We will likely use it on drinks but unfortunately won't be back for food. The experience was not a good one and we expect more from restaurants. TLDR: Paying customers shouldn't ever be told to wait until an establishment is closed to leave feedback and when they don't like a dish, just exchange it, and ask for feedback after they have something they're happy with. Paying customers deserve to get their money's worth and enjoy every part of their experience. Food, drinks, and ambiance were cool. A bit slow. Service was subpar.","stars":3.0}

As it turned out the tire could not be repaired, but the agent effortlessly transitioned to sales mode. Finding affordable tires with the amazing Road Hazard warranty they have. They only ask that you repurchase the warranty on a repaired tire and they will repair or replace it until it drops below legal tread level.

{"text":"I recently went on a trip overseas and it got me back in touch with drinking more tea. I've been on tea kicks here and there in my life (last time before most recently was during a trip to Michigan where I found a small store with great teas) but most haven't stuck. So when I got back home from traveling overseas I kept drinking tea and bought boxes from local grocery stores until I remembered the store in Michigan which made me want to drink more handmade, high quality teas. This led me to Yelp which lead me to Traveling Tea. When I walked in I at first didn't see the whole selection (I wasn't being that observant lol) but once I took the whole store in I noticed that they do have a big selection. The selection was overwhelming in a good way. It was basically a \"there are so many good things to choose from which makes it more difficult but I know I'll really love what I buy and enjoy it\" type overwhelming. The good type of overwhelming as said above. I ended up buying the Cacao Chai Tea and have to say that it has excellent flavor. Very smooth with definite hints of cacao. Ultimately I was hoping for something with a higher caffeine content but I would still rate this a fantastic tea due to the flavor. I will say that my tea palette is still being refined but I'd rate that tea a 8 or 8.5\/10. If the caffeine content were higher the rating would be higher as well. YMMV based on how caffeinated you like your teas. I also bought a one serving tea from their high caffeine shelf and can't wait to try that. It was the Guayusa Ginger Citrus. Citrus + heavy caffeine sounds wonderful. Can't wait to try it. As others have said, the hours aren't very standard on certain days so be sure to look up the hours on their website before driving there. All in all this seems to be a great place to shop if you are looking for good teas and I will definitely be back. I'd give it a 4.5\/5 rating so I gave it a 5\/5 since yelp doesn't allow us to do half stars which I think is unfair and didn't want to rate it a 4\/5.","stars":5.0}

When I bought my ticket the woman told me she didn't have any change, and then when I asked to buy my parking pass (it is $2 and not $1 as I saw somewhere) she told me I would have to wait until she got cash in her register. I could have put it on my credit card with my ticket, but I guess she didn't hear me say I wanted one. So then I went to the bar to get something to eat (and a beer, why not, it's Friday). The guy there said the bartender was running late but he offered to help me. I ordered the steamed buns, and he said \"So you can order food here or at concessions or at your seat in the theater with our tablets...\" Uh, I just ordered. I told him I would just order at my seat and I left. The tablet ordering system did actually work the way it was supposed to, and I didn't have any problems ordering or with the system flashing. Do be aware that the \"house chips\" are plain Lay's. The sandwich was good though.

This is actually my first time grabbing food from here, and it was such a bad experience. I called for pickup, and the man who answered and took my ordered seemed very rude. It was as if I was bothering him by calling ahead for my order, which I usually do. Not only was the customer service a bit horrible, but also the food quality. The rice was sooooo mushy and over cooked, I felt like I was eating a clump of slop. The loco moco was delicious though, minus the rice. Also, the combination plate of bbq chicken and bbq beef was dry and grizzly. We definitely did not get the best cuts. Portion was also the smallest I have seen before! We were both shocked upon opening the to-go container. Overall, not a very pleasant experience from this store.

{"text":"I should start by saying that I had never had Ethiopian food prior to my experience at here. I was greatly anticipating trying out something new thanks to Group On, but I left a little disappointed. The service was fine, but the food took awhile to arrive at the table, which my dining partners told me is typical for Ethiopian food. Just a heads up if you are in a hurry. There were four of us, so we ordered one Veggie Platter and one Taste of Ethiopia meat sampler which ended up being plenty of food ~$40. Both things came with an ample amount of the cold bread that you use to eat everything with. The vegetable sampler was OK, a couple of the things were similar to curry, while others we just pickles. Nothing on the plate was bad, but nothing really stood out either. The meat sampler contained one beef, one chicken, and one lamb dish all of which I did not care for. The chicken and lamb dishes both tasted exactly like Bleu Cheese. I'm not sure if was supposed to taste like this or not, but it was a little off putting with the rest of the flavors. The beef was just kind of dry and bland. I think it is possible that I just don't care for Ethiopian food that much, which is not the restaurants fault. Two of the four people eating seemed to think it was average compared to their other Ethiopian dining experiences, hence the 3 stars.","stars":3.0}

Only wrote up the work order for 30 boxes when we had a little less than double that. They were mostly small as to not be so heavy. The truck they brought didn't fit all of our things so it required a second trip. Ended up having to pay double what they told us. One of the movers was a straight up jerk and complained that we had too much stuff. Tried to make us feel like they were doing us some huge favor by not charging all these additional fees so we would tip them more. They couldn't even get our armoire to the second floor of our new townhouse. Also gave us an issue getting things out of the attic even though we helped them get it down. Made us feel uncomfortable and that we were inconveniencing them almost the entire time the we loading and unloading. The only saving grace to this craziness is that its finally over.

{"text":"*This review is strictly about Sukho Thai's Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mow)* Firstly, I have eaten at multiple Thai restaurants over the past 8 or so years after I got introduced to it. The scenery is very nice. It is upscale and classy. Now let's get to the food itself. My favorite dish in all of Thailand is the Pad Kee Mow. No two restaurants I have been to prepare it the exact same way. They differ in noodles and accompaniments. Sukho Thai's Pad Kee Mow has a brown gravy that the noodles sit over. This brown gravy is nothing but overkill. The noodles, meat, and vegetables are already seasoned to the tee, why saturate this plate with brown gravy underneath it? If anything, serve it on the side as a dip\/sauce. All 5 or so Thai restaurants I have been to serve the Pad Kee Mow as a \"dry\" dish not with broth or a gravy. Nevertheless, they still receive a 3\/5 since it looks very nice on the inside. Good looking customers and somewhat good looking waitstaff are on hand. I have faith in Sukho Thai. Lose the gravy in Pad Kee Mow and you are the premier Thai food spot in Metro New Orleans.","stars":3.0}

The wonderful gentleman who used to work there is home and now the three times I've been back a particular female employee makes the experience uncomfortable and unpleasant. I'm assuming this person is a lead of some sort, as she barks orders at other employees and makes insinuate comments within earshot of the customers. Even the other customers are getting rude in this place. A random guy in line got way too into my business because he didn't understand a joke I was making with my husband. It's also impossible to get condiments at this location... I know the dumb policy that only ketchup comes with burgers so if I want BBQ, I have to pay a quarter. It's the policy and I try to make it easy...but they'll forget to ring it in and then get pissy when I ask after the fact.

{"text":"I'm a former long-term Indianapolis resident but haven't been back to visit for any length of time for a decade. On the recommendation of a friend who shares my reticence regarding chain restaurants, my husband and I gave Stone Creek a try. The decor, ambiance, and service were all lovely. Although the tables are closely placed, the noise level doesn't interfere with normal conversational tones. I ordered the blackened mahi mahi served over dirty rice with bacon (stroke of genius, even if you're over the bacon craze). My carnivore partner ordered the New York strip, well done. Well-done is not my choice, but I think it's ridiculous when a restaurant attaches caveats and excuses disavowing their responsibility for quality when burdened with the order of a well done steak. There was no such quibbling, and his steak was perfectly prepared, full flavored, and moist and tender. Likewise, my mahi mahi was delicately delicious, subtly enhanced but in no way overpowered by the blackening spices. The dirty rice goes without saying-I would order it as a main course! The wine list is nicely balanced, if not extensive, and fairly priced; I enjoyed the two Chardonnays I ordered. But-herein lies the one and only reason I'm not comfortable with a five star rating-my husband ordered two mixed drinks and was disappointed with both. The first was a tropical concoction of some sort, with rum, pineapple juice, and so much lime juice that it was rendered bitterly undrinkable. Thinking perhaps he had just not ordered to his personal taste, he abandoned the first after a few sips and ordered a personal tried-and-true, a Long Island Iced Tea. I know what those look like, even if I don't drink them, but what was delivered certainly wasn't anything I recognized-looked like a glass of lemonade with a little wispy dribble of something brown halfway down one side of the drink. Husband said there was no discernible flavor other than sweet and sour and didn't drink but a few sips of it. Not enough to be a deal breaker for this meal, but considering that between the two cocktails we're talking about nearly 20 bucks, it's certainly a concern. If I could split the bar rating from the rest of the experience, the bartender would rate no stars while everything else would receive a well-deserved five stars.","stars":4.0}

When I heard $300 my gut had dropped but the items needed to go. I said is there some kind of discount for the lateness\/inconvenience they said no. I told them to get started and next thing I knew they knocked a 6 inch hole into my wall with the treadmill and scraped my wooden floor leaving a 10 inch deep scratch with the sofa. I said you guys are destroying my house so they said we could take some of the bill to compensate for the damage. I said this is crazy because the damage exceeds the cost of the job. They called a manager who then told them to take $50 off and give me junk bucks which are coupons I could use again in the future. I basically told them here is $99 bucks and keep the coupons. After I called 3 contractors to estimate the damage they caused the lowest was $650 to fix the hole and the scratches.

The asparagus, poached egg and hollandaise and the risotto balls swimming in a puddle of marinara were equally awesome. I didn't think i'd like a ball of risotto. While the more interesting pizzas were vetoed because of various pork or beef topped products, we got the 4 cheese and the margarita pizza. Amazzzzing. In fact, so amazing that when my bro-inlaw breezed through town again 2 weeks later, he shot down all my restaurant choices and instead wanted to eat here again. 2 weeks later the menu had already changed to other various interesting pizza creations, but he was so hard-pressed for an exact reenactment of his previous experience, he sweet-talked his way into the chef rummaging in his cheese pantry to recreate his quatro-formaggio he so loved.

{"text":"This used to be my favorite sushi place but after trying Kasai Sushi I can't say that anymore. I went back to see how it was and was sorely disappointed. I had a bowl of miso soup and I found the flavor to be bland and full of green onions, not a fan. I had a shrimp tempura roll and a white roll as well. The white tuna on top of the white out roll was old and a little too chewy. The tempura in both rolls was very thing and soggy. Overall the sushi did not hold up to Kasai's. I paid 21.34 for this food and at Kasai I could have gotten all you eat with better sushi and better food for the same price. I will not be returning.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"This is considerably better than one would expect from a mid-priced steakhouse chain. My nicely-seasoned 18-ounce ribeye was tender, juicy, free of fat and gristle, grilled medium-rare as requested, and large enough to warrant a doggie bag. A 9-ounce filet, topped with melted bleu cheese and served on a marinated, grilled portabella mushroom, was equally good. Steaks and prime rib are served with an addictive, hot-from-the-oven loaf of bread, a Caesar or mixed green salad (the chipotle ranch dressing has a nice kick), and one item from a rather unimaginative list of sides (a baked sweet potato with cinnamon-butter proved to be a good choice). Sharing a slice of creamy cappuccino cheesecake, topped with a Kahlua-flavored chocolate sauce, satisfied my mother's sweet tooth. Our overly perky server was almost too attentive, although her tableside appearances may have been less frequent had it not been a quiet Tuesday evening. Given the option of a waitress who's in-your-face or out-of-sight, I guess in the long run the former is preferable.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"We celebrated a kid's birthday here because he's fond of it. Nothing has changed since the last time I was here. This review won't change anything, either; people will still be coming in droves, and the lines will still be out-the-door. I knew it was going to be a hectic buffet atmosphere so ... I wasn't looking for any atmosphere. I also knew it was going to be buffet food, but I was looking for at least some decent buffet food. Forget it, though. This is bottom of the barrel. This isn't about food snobbery; again, we're talking about just wanting some basic, decent buffet food (setting the bar pretty low). This place just doesn't deliver. The best way to summarize it: a really bad mall food court chinese place that smashed into a really bad grade school cafeteria of the old days. Reminds me of the movie, City Slickers (with Billy Crystal), where the food preparer summarizes the food to Billy Crystal's character and others: \"It's brown. It's hot. And there's plenty of it.\" There's plenty of it, but that's about it. I've been to a number of large-volume buffets, and I set my expectation appropriately. This place makes other large-volume buffets seem like culinary heaven in comparison. I just can't believe this place is not only still in business but thriving. Ok - some specifics. The pasta is tasteless and overboiled (think some huge boxes of really crappy, cheap pasta boiled in pots that you can fit a hyundai in until every last bit of any taste that they might have had is boiled out of them). The sauce is tasteless (makes Ragu seem good). The mashed potatoes are along the same lines -- boxed (!) and shoveled out with volume as the goal. The fried chicken (of all things) is bland and oily -- I mean, you can't even get some decadent, decent-tasting fried chicken skin -- it's just really bad fried chicken. The chinese food - mandarin chicken, etc. - is garbage -- the lowest quality, fattiest, crappiest 'chicken' that I had to spit out a few times because it was just unbelievably crappy. The egg rolls tasted like they were the really cheap, crappy, no-name ones that you see in bulk stores -- and then they were microwaved. Yuck. I didn't even try most of the stuff -- the vegetables looked, again, like overboiled cafeteria veggies. And to think that you literally wait on line (for at least 20 minutes) to subject yourself to this crap. Was anything good? The steak was good (and they cook it in front of you). The service - in this hectic, crowded, craziness - was very good. Some of the desserts were tasty (e.g. I had the chocolate fudge). Note: the 'ice cream' is that crappy, frozen ice stuff they serve in many chinese buffets so ... no good on that.","stars":1.0}

The service was fine, our server was on top of things and they made a pretty great bloody mary. We didn't have a great view from our table, just a little sliver of ocean and a little walkway that apparently only the birds use. I saw a pretty mangy looking seagull walk by and was really glad there was glass between us. Yikes! I had a crab melt which was pretty good, with lots of possibly real crab meat and nice toasty sourdough but the cole slaw was just so\/so and had raisins in it so I just picked at that. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their meals and the service so it was not the worst choice we could have made. And beware, if you have a fear of heights or bridges, this place is actually on the pier, meaning you can drive your car ON the pier.

{"text":"Good haircut, great price, convenient location! They have an Axxess deal for a $35 haircut (for women) every time. Beauty Salon V is a quaint, no-excess salon in Goleta with really kind stylists. After looking in the area and spending $60+ on other haircuts, I was wanting to find a more affordable rate with the ideal long-term stylist. The set-up is efficient and suited for their stylists, but don't expect fancy finishes and a massive display of designer products like you might find elsewhere. I called to make an appointment, and I got my selected time. When I arrived and the stylist talked with me about my haircut, it was a super short-and-sweet convo. She nodded as I showed her a few pictures, then she got to work. She didn't ask many questions during this process. Personal pet peeve: uncomfortable hair washing stations. Most chairs seem like they're designed 1-2in too short for the sink, putting a lot of strain on your neck. This wasn't the worst hair washing station, but it wasn't comfortable either. During the whole haircut, there was only a bit of small talk - that could be a dream for some, but I was somewhat hoping for questions about how I preferred to wear my hair so she could do the best cut possible for me. She cut my hair pretty efficiently, appearing to go off the photos I'd already shown her but without much added personalization. When she blow dried it, she asked if I'd like it styled straight or curly, and I said wavy\/curly. She styled it with a curling iron, giving it a bit more of a little girl curl finish than my normal wavy with straight ends vibe. I think Beauty Salon V gives good, consistent haircuts and I definitely appreciate the price, but in the end, I don't think it's the long-term, modern hair salon I'm looking for!","stars":4.0}

So once I have good eventually find my way in I mentioned it to the bartender who seem to not care at all. Minimal Conversation and emotion. Did not seem very happy to be there.

Most likely will not go back unless I just have to be in the area with nothing better to do. Definitely will not make a special trip.

{"text":"Although San Ysidro Ranch has been welcoming guests since the late 1800's, I just enjoyed my first 2 stays here just 2 weeks apart. Originally a sanctuary for Franciscan monks in the late 1700's, it was also a citrus farm. Most famously, John F. and Jaqueline Kennedy honeymooned here. The Ranch has been owned by Ty Warner of Beanie Babies fame since 2000. He is a local resident and also owns the nearby Four Seasons Biltmore (currently closed). Never an inexpensive lodging choice, the Ranch had increased value recently. When the pandemic closed both indoor and outdoor dining, the Ranch offered an all-meal-inclusive in-room dining package at standard rates. During my second visit, outdoor dining had just reopened, so the Ranch included restaurant dining in the package as well. The Ranch is located in a residential area of affluent Montecito, nestled amongst estates with large roadside gates and mansions not visible from the street. The Ranch itself is down a lovely lane surrounded by olive trees and fields of lavender. There are 41 cottages\/hideaways situated U-shaped around expertly-tended central gardens of citrus, roses, vegetables and herbs, plus a lovely pool and temporarily closed fitness centre. The 2017 wildfires, especially the Thomas Fire, severely denuded the hills above the Ranch, so the subsequent heavy rains and mudslides in January 2018 heavily damaged or destroyed about half of the Ranch's cottages. However, by March 2019 the Ranch had reopened, thanks to speedy reconstruction and renovation, lots of mature trees, vines and plants, and Mr. Warner's clout. The Ranch looks unscathed today. Some of the cottages are free-standing, others share common walls. All have private patios, Persian rugs, antiques, four poster king canopy beds. Some have hot tubs, outdoor rain showers and stone fireplaces (gas). Mr. Warner is fond of pigs and their significance in Chinese culture, so there is a sleeping or sniffing porcelain pig in each cottage (also for sale in the gift shop). There is an expansive minibar with top-shelf liquor and many bottles of wine. The non-alcoholic beverages and snacks are complimentary. I stayed in the Jasmine and Magnolia Cottages. The Jasmine is a quaint free-standing creekside cottage, while the Magnolia is one of the French Lavender cottages, slightly larger. There's no such thing as a \"bad\" cottage--make a choice based on location, availability and price. The Kennedy cottage is one of the pricier ones, while the Warner cottage, really a 2 bedroom 2.5 bathroom villa with its own pool, is the priciest. During my first stay, only in-room dining was available. The menu choices were fairly broad. The attendant can set up the meal either indoors or outside. For my second stay, the Stonehouse Restaurant had reopened for outdoor dining on its upper terrace and lower patio. There was just one menu--when both Stonehouse and Plow and Angel (a second less formal restaurant) are open, I believe there are 2 separate menus. The restaurant menu had a few more choices than the in-room dining menu and the atmosphere and ambiance are beautiful. I enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner on the","stars":5.0}

My only quibble was that it was served in a rocks glass, which given the amount of ice and cut citrus, seems like a stingy drink.

The individual who was seating us took us to the large room in the back and tried to seat us in the most crowded room. If the tables were 6 ft apart, or tables were closed so we could sit 6ft from the other table we would have sat in that room. The individual then moved us to the next room, the only table that was clearly 6ft from the next occupied table was right next to the bathroom. After we were seated my husband over heard the server from the large crowded room ask the person who sat us 'whose table is THAT!' We sat for more than 5 minutes, nobody waited on us, and 3 different people went right past our table to the bathroom 'no masks'. We got up to leave , there were 2 individuals at what I can only assume is the hostess stand with their heads down looking at a phone. Nobody saw us leave, very disappointed. My final note, if you are going to have a hostess stand, have professional dressed, mature individuals working it. My experience now since this is only my second time at this restaurant, is the individuals seating patrons aren't at the stand, both times they were in the bar, and behaving as though they were patrons in the bar. Furthermore neither time were they dressed as though they were seating patrons at what I assumed is expected to be a higher end Steak House.

I am very happy with my lashes. I will return to the salon.

{"text":"I'm not a big fan of pastries and desserts (I know, I know) but I was visiting family and they suggested we stop by. There were so many pastries, I had no idea what to get since they all looked so good. We ended up ordering a snickerdoodle cookie, box of macaroons, mini mango cake, mini raspberry cake, and two coffees. The star of the show for me was definitely the mango cake. I'm not a fan of coconut, but the coconut and mango combination was fantastic. The taste was light, refreshing, and not sweet at all. I had no idea who Nathaniel Reid was or what he looked like, but when my family member pointed me out to him, I was in awe. He's so nice and friendly, and I loved how he took the time to talk to each customer individually. The staff is great as well. They gave us two blueberry macaroons to try since they were cracked and unable to sell. The gesture was sweet and the macaroon was amazing. I'll be sure to stop by when I visit St. Louis again.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I know I was critical and I got annoyed with the fact that it seemed like my car was fine when I brought it in but then broke during a test drive.... but to be honest, they caught what my dealership's service department didn't during the inspection. Squeaking and loud noises at low speed. And I'm not sure if it was related to the clutch but it could have been, I guess. All I know is that now FINALLY my car does not squeak anymore. That is all I care about right now. Just do yourself a favor... if you have to pay for car repairs, do NOT use Duvera financing. They have a daily compounded interest that is REALLY high. I mean, like you'd have to go to a loan shark to get a better deal. I think the interest rate for the year was 189%. I am not kidding. Take out a 401k loan or borrow the money, but do not do Duvera if it's offered to you due to low credit. I did that the first time I came and regretted it because when I thought I was paying off the balance, there was a trickling of daily interest that brought it above $0. I had to request a Zero Balance letter from them to get them off my back. But the car runs great now and most importantly does NOT squeak. I just wish I took it here to get fixed for this problem before I let the dealership take a crack at it. They not only did not fix it, but they told me it was a nail in the tire which I knew was fake. AAMCO found the problem and now my car runs like it's new again.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This hotel is in the idea spot. However, as an elite member we had 24 hour access to the M Club. The breakfast was good but they constantly ran out of food. The evening appetizers were nice but again they constantly ran out of food. I'm pecsectarian and I was told I could put in a request for the chef to make something for me conducive to my diet. Well, the first day he did. The following days I was told he couldn't do that anymore. Then I asked for additional vegetables that were on the buffet and I was told they didn't have anymore. This was told to me at 530 and they start serving at 5. The vegetables ran out each and everyday that I was there. The M Club was not a happy experience. I also noticed a lot of non Elite people coming in and eating that shouldn't have. Upon my check out I had been charged 3 charges for utilizing the Club. If I hadn't looked at my bill it would have been a mess on my credit card. Also, the water pressure in the rooms are a joke. It took 20 minutes to wash shampoo out of my hair. I will give a shot out to Natalie and Cari who are amazing front desk ladies. Thats where the 2 stars come in.","stars":2.0}

Very spacious. *Food - The food was good. The shrimp tacos were a little disappointing, but the rest was very good. This is a more casual venue to grab some drinks and dancing for cheap. Definitely go later in the week though because I imagine it is a better crowd.","stars":3.0}

It was my first time having an Impossible burger and I was worried because it tasted like the real thing, but I didn't get sick. Also had my husband taste it and he said it wasn't meat. Really enjoyed this place, the only drawback is how dang expensive it is. As for my delivery experience using Door Dash, it brought my rating down by a star because they gave me the wrong type of burger even though I checked the correct one and also included the name of it in my instructions. On the plus side the potato crisps were delicious. It's just a good thing I can handle heat or I'd be more upset I got the \"Dry Heat\" rather than \"Good night Kiss\" I ordered.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"This is the closest \"Packer Bar\" to our home so we decided to take in a Sunday game along with other fans. First, the bad stuff. Although they tout dozens of TV's they're all fairly small for a sports bar. None of the TV's were bigger than ours at home. Watching the game from near the back of the room was a challenge. It was hard to tell what was going on a lot of the time on the TV. It would be great if they invested in one huge TV for that dining area or at least had a projection system or something. Trying to watch half a dozen small TV's showing simultaneously is a chore. As for the food, it was decent but nothing spectacular. We started off with the appetizer sampler which was listed as onion rings, zucchini strips, and mushrooms beer battered and fried and served with ranch dressing on the side. Sounded good. Unfortunately, when they arrived someone in the kitchen had decided they needed a little something extra and had dumped about half a jar of horrid powdered cheese on top of them. They would have been decent had it not been for that. The powdered cheese made them horrible. For our main dish we had the Firework Chipotle Chicken sandwich with fries. The sandwich was decent but nothing incredible. Very basic bar and grill type fare. The addition of the \"bottlecap jalapenos\" was nice and added some kick to the sandwich. Without a doubt the best part were the fries which were fresh and nicely hand cut. While not in the same league as Five Guys they were better than fast food fries and substantially better than most chain casual dining restaurants that serve fries. Desserts aren't listed on the menu but we asked our server about them and she informed us they did have a few things available like chocolate cake, ice cream or deep fried brownie bites. We opted for the brownie bites and they were quite good. She'd said they came with a scoop of ice cream but when they arrived it was simply whipped cream with a little drizzle of chocolate sauce. Regardless, they were delicious and hot with a crunchy exterior and wonderful soft chocolate interior. The prices are pretty reasonable for a sports bar and grill and we did have a good time watching the game with other Packers fans and cheering. Although we'll opt to watch games at home thanks to a better view of the TV, we still will keep Famous Sam's in mind for important games that aren't televised locally.","stars":3.0}

The selection can be good or bad depending on what time you come in and which part of the season it is. It is a big store but I've always found something that suits my taste.The customer service is what you would expect for teenage employees - not great, but good enough.

{"text":"Went here for the first time today with my wife and 12 year old son. First, the good... its a real nice place, very clean, good atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and helpful (although the greeter lady had a thick Italian accent, so listen carefully!) We had no wait, but it is fairly small so I could see that being an issue if you go at the wrong time. Food came out quickly, although it was before the dinner rush so not yet crowded (it was filling up as we were leaving). Pretty good selection to choose from. The food I'd say was good, but not great. Probably not the best I've ever had, but I generally concur with the other reviewers and I doubt many will have an issue with the quality of the food (it definitely was fresh and we saw no problems whatsoever with the preparation, it was more a question of not loving our own choices). Portion size also seemed good (I finished all of my entree, my wife and son had some to take home, all regular sizes). The salad I had (baby arugula with mozzarella and prosciutto) was especially good! Our one big problem was the price: $127 before tip in total. That seems a bit steep for three people, and nobody ordered anything crazy. Now, part of that was not asking for the prices of the specials ($30 for my entree, a pasta with seafood dish, and $15 for that admittedly excellent salad, which was NOT entree-sized but nice for a side dish)... but that aside, it was still quite a bit. Obviously the question is whether a meal is worth the price you pay regardless of how much it is. While it WAS a good meal, we didn't feel it was $127 good. So, the bottom line for me is if you go here you'll probably enjoy it, but prepared for the bill lest you have sticker shock like we did. FYI, I've eaten at a number of authentic Italian restaurants in Boston's east end... I'd say the food at this place compares pretty favorably, but its a bit overpriced in comparison. Nice to at least have such an option in the area though, that's for sure! If not for the price I'd have given this four stars without hesitation, and I wouldn't argue with anyone that says five stars.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Last night my friend and I went to Southwark. As usual, we sat in the bar, and as usual, we were treated to mouthwatering food, sublime cocktails, and exquisite service and banter from Kip and George behind the bar. Southwark is most definitely a place for foodies and those who love a truly well-made cocktail, yet it has the relaxed atmosphere of a neighbourhood delight you want to come back to again and again. The food is always delicious and light, with just the right sized portions - you'll find no foams or overly-rich smudges of sauce here! - and the flavours in each dish always complement each other perfectly, like a culinary symphony. Because the food is seasonal, the menu changes all the time (but if you go now, do yourself a favour and try the mutton appetizer and the liver entree...they were nothing short of heavenly). Every time I've gone to Southwark (and I've been MANY times), each dish has been right on the mark, from the appetizer to the desert, the cocktails have been perfection, and the service has been wonderful... so I thought it was high time to write a review. Before doing so I had a look through the posted reviews on Southwark, just out of interest, and was rather upset by a review from Ruby B, who described Kip and \"his sidekicks\" as \"the Bar Nazis\"....then I noticed that Ruby B is from New Jersey and it all became clear. Ruby - perhaps you should stay in New Jersey (where I'm sure your local Olive Garden can more than accommodate your culinary needs) and let the rest of us who appreciate good food, cocktails and excellent service, enjoy Southwark without you...and by the way, Ruby, Kip and George do not \"lecture\" about cocktails, they are merely passing on their wisdom (clearly, in Ruby's case, they were throwing pearls before swine). I hate to end this review on a sour note, so I'll close with this: if you haven't been to Southwark, do yourself a favour and try it out.

{"text":"My stay at Hotel Preston is about my fourth. I originally stayed here a couple of years ago when using Priceline to find a hotel. This visit was due to a company function being held at Hotel Preston, so it was convenient. My room was clean and what I needed. I did have a hard time finding a place near the bed to charge my telephone and laptop. (It would be nice to have outlets that are easy to get to other than the desk lamp). I had dinner at the restaurant. I remembered that the food was good, and I was not disappointed. I ordered the balsamic chicken which was amazing. Service was wonderful...a very attentive staff. There is a lounge adjacent to the restaurant, so it gets loud once the band starts so if you are looking for a quiet dinner, eat before the band gets going. I needed a corkscrew so I visited the front desk to borrow one and was directed to the bar. The female bartender was not able to loan me a corkscrew and said I could either bring my bottle to the very busy bar, or to the restaurant which I was not interested in doing either. I went back to the front desk and they were able to find one from the restaurant. I felt as though the bartender just didn't want to bother with me. If I weren't a loyal diamond guest at another hotel chain due to my business travel, I would stay here again. Again, my stay was due to business at the hotel however, I HIGHLY recommend this unique hotel and encourage anyone to try the restaurant.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This facility is really first rate in all respects. Seems like mgmt takes feedback on other Lifetime clubs and makes the next ones better. For instance, Ft Washington has 2 completely separate lap pools for adults (one inside, one outside) not just a roped-off area of the family pool that other clubs have. Lap pools are clean, open many hours and not too warm - the big three if you're joining to swim. They are constantly testing water quality. The ladies locker rooms are spotless and always well supplied. I think there are w eights and machines somewhere in the club ;-) but these can wait for winter when the outdoor pool is closed! Staff is friendly and competent. The one class I've tried - Pilates - is too tough for me, but Geoffrey makes you laugh while you're toppling over, so that helps the pain and makes you want to come back. Also kudos to Evan in sales - no high pressure, just assesses what you're looking for, shows you what you ask to see, and lays out the price.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I had an appointment at the Apple Store and after getting my computer worked on there, I stopped off at the new Oath Pizza. I came in and the staff behind the counter kindly greeted me and asked me if I had been to the restaurant before. I appreciated that they recommended to me not to get too many toppings on the pizza because the crust will break, but I found it a bit odd that they had crust that could not hold that many toppings. I went ahead and got a regular pizza with some chicken on top. It was made pretty quickly and came out nice and warm. As other reviews stated, the crust at Oath Pizza is very thin, crispy and light. Although, that adds a nice distinct taste it is unable to hold too much and breaks. The bottom part of the pizza was a bit droopy at times, but I did find the crust to be tasty and go well with the sauce. The chicken that was provided was very nice and moist. Some pieces were a bit chewy, but it was only a minor issue. The staff was light with the sauce, but I thought that it was flavorful and went well with the chicken. Next time that I am at Oath Pizza, I wouldn't resist trying the Triple Chocolate Cookie Pizza, which sounded delicious. This time, I only got a chocolate chip cookie, but it was tasty with large chunks of chocolate and was moist. I appreciated that they gave me a free fountain drink on the house, but they gave me a block of wood to identify myself. It was fairly big, but wasn't that heavy. However, I thought that I didn't need it to be given to me because I was the only person in the restaurant. Altogether, Crust Pizza serves a flavorful pizza and crust, but they could improve the amount of toppings that the pizza could hold. I will return!","stars":4.0}

This work of art, spread atop excellent multi grain toast and garnished with greens and petunia petals, was likely the best of breed. It was delicious, while providing superlative flavor and crunchable texture. Just stupendous! The suck down smoothie called \"Blueberry Wake Up,\" was all that, too. It was richly blueberried, and blended with other ingredients (see menu photo) that were almost addictive. Semisweet, darkly indigo, thick and creamy, and loaded with energy, it was hard to take the straw out of my mouth. And, combined with the egg salad, made for a surprisingly memorable morning meal. Service was friendly, informative, impeccable and attractive. The small shop full of magical foods and additives to help you live a more healthy and essential life. Just check out the wire egg basket. Those uber fresh hard shells were right from the nest, without even a stop for a bath. I'm a believer.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I need more greasy diner food in my life. Well, most of the food I would be able to pass over... but as far as breakfast foods go, I need more greasy diner food in my life. I have been on the bad side of \"You have never been to Uncle Bills?\" for a few years now. I guess now that I have been, I can turn around and use this on other people. Unfortunately my first visit was not one where I was completely drunk... because I understand in general that is the time to go. But here's hoping for next time. This time was just breakfast. It was the best option for a Saturday morning after a long Friday night out. There was a bit of a wait when we walked in the door, which I assumed was normal, but I didn't really understand the line part. Everyone waits in a line that is marked off by a little barrier to separate the entrance and the exit areas. I can't tell if there is usually a line, and the line was not very long, but it was there. We waited about ten minutes for a table. This was totally reasonable. But then it seemed like we were waiting at the table for quite a while before a waitress came over. Or really before anyone brought coffee, which is a critical play in a situation like this. As for ordering, the name of the place has the word \"pancake\" in it, so that is what I went for. I was between blueberry and buckwheat, which I think is a generally overlooked and underrated pancake choice. I went with the buckwheat, and it was a good choice. The blueberry got knocked off the list because of the compote, which means probably no blueberries in the pancakes, but maybe a solid try for next time. My breakfast eating counterpart got the pecan, which I will admit here, but never to his face, that I was pretty jealous of when they came out because they smelled absolutely amazing. Also on the short list of choices for next time. Once the coffee started coming, the staff kept the cups pretty full, which is good because the only thing that knocks down my reviews of breakfast places more than an empty coffee cup is nothing. Full, in fact, I like it when they have a roaming robot with a carafe filling the cups. Ok, that has never happened, but it is a solid idea. The staff here was as remarkably close to those robots as I have ever seen, and I loved it. As for asthetics, you can't really get better than wood paneling and carpet that looks like it has been there since 1961 when the place opened. The big question that I have is: Is there just this one carpet company that is supplying old timey restaurants with new carpet to make it look like the carpet has never been changed? Because even if you are open for 24 hours\/7 days, for 50 years,","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I credit this school for: a) instilling in me a love of dance. They have a spacious studio above the Oaks with top to bottom windows. Instructor Beverly Trask is my hero. b) its aesthetics of a green quad, red brick building campus feel while I studied away my days. c) helping a once shy girl like me get her nose out of a book and be a social butterfly, having certainly met friends for life here. d) having such a rich history. Every now and then I'd run across black and white photo archives of students in the 1920s, 1960s, and even 80s seeming to have the best time of their lives. The naysayers may just dismiss this fine institution as a \"party school,\" but that's only just seeing one on the surface element of this unique place. I met underground radio types and community service involved students that went on to do Teach for America and Peace Corps. I wear my Tulane t-shirt with pride and I get annoyed when it's falsely assumed students just came here to have fun. We played hard, and many of us worked harder! :) The silly, yet meaningful things I remember about this school are that: bizzarely enough, the otherwise very subpar Bruff Cafeteria had great breakfasts (biscuits, scrambled eggs, grits). Yum! And it was never hard to get space to play on its sunny tennis courts. I heart you, Tulane. Hail to thee, o alma mater.

{"text":"I was really excited when the street car had a stop by here because I love going to breweries. But this was not what I thought at all. We walked in and the place was really quiet, with a couple of people. We sat at the bar, and started to look over the menu, but couldn't find any of their beers on the list. And when we looked at the taps, they all were all beers from different breweries. When I asked the bartender what Jackson Brewery beers were on tap, he said that the Brewery stopped making beers years ago and it no longer exists, only the building is left for other businesses. Instead, they serve local craft beers from all around Louisiana. Having never had beer from Louisiana I did a flight, which came with four samples. I tried the three IPAs that were available and a coffee porter. Unfortunately, all of the IPAs were really weak and not that hoppy, which was disappointing since IPA is my favorite kind of beer. When I asked the bartender about what are some popular IPAs from the state are, he told me that not a lot of people like IPAs; but more breweries are starting up around the area, and they always carry an IPA just to have one. Okay... Maybe I am too Pacific Northwest, but it was still disappointing to learn of the beer scene in Louisiana. The bartender was friendly though hence the two stars.","stars":2.0}

Service is always really quick, with placing of, arrival of, and removal of food dishes in addition to our bottomless liquid refreshments. The food quality is pretty good as well. Now I haven't dabbled too much outside of the Pho menu (yes, I'm a pho-phile, and no, therapy hasn't helped), but my late night dining mate does and each time he has been really impressed with the items he's received. Thus far, their rare skirt steak pho (pho-tai) is my favorite. There is a bit more oil than I'm used to in Golden Flower's soup, but I find it surprisingly good. Portion size is spot on in that anytime I think about ordering a \"large\" i immediately regret my decision as there is always way more than I can finish. Price you ask? Pretty spot on for the area.

We walked into a long bar and tight and snagged two seats at the bar. The bartender was friendly and working hard. I ordered the Bizet cocktail (spanish vodka, passionfruit, clementine, and thyme). Amazing! What an awesome drink! I don't like cocktails that are too citrusy-y or orange-y and this was spot-on. Very refreshing for a spring day. For food we ordered the papas fritas, which were fried potatos that were really taste. We also ordered the calamari which is cooked in the squid sauce, so the calamari is still black. The calamari was good but there are probably other more interesting and tasty options on the menu. The bartender was knowledgeable about which items are gluten free and could be made gluten free. When I called ahead to make sure they had gluten free options the hostess said \"many! and I am gluten free.\" So that was reassuring.

{"text":"One thing straight. The food is VERY good! Aside from that, this place has a few things to take care of. When you advertise as a brunch spot, you know that you are going to get crowds. In fact, expect crowds on a Saturday morning. We live a few doors down from Toast and we've been excited to go for some time now. We arrived around 10:50am and placed our orders. We received our food around 11:35am. That is quite long for some breakfast, just saying. We watched not ONE but THREE tables get up and leave because their food took an immense amount of time. It seemed that two were locals and the other 4 people were tourists and on a schedule. It was very awkward to see every table looking around to see why the food takes so long. I find it incredible that THREE tables left and a manager or someone pulls aside the waitress, reprimanding her. I feel that management is the issue here, not the waitresses. How would they control the time that the food takes? Anywho, food is great but service SUCKS! If you are looking for a quick brunch, stay away. If you have time to kill, definitely try this place out!","stars":3.0}

I do not feel its good enough for a revisit based on the food quality and how long it took to get into the restaurant. They also have like no parking and neighborhood is not safe to walk outside. I highly suggest vallet. They let you get drinks and appetizers (no entrees) at top railing but not bar since they do reservation for those. The place is not organized and we watched many open seats while we waited for our table.. annoying. We also had to send back some food for tasting bad such as the chicken liver... the food was average. I would suggest getting a drink and sitting by fireplace maybe try and appertizer by rail if available and go to a nicer place for dinner. This is a one and done in my book.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I've been to this location enough times and have had both good and bad experiences. It's McDonald's. Good employees in general are hard to find so usually the good ones aren't working at a fast food establishment. I don't mind dining in at this location because the inside of it was remodeled recently and it is very modern, clean and spacious. The checkout process here is pretty quick for the most part as long as you don't get stuck behind four senior citizens attempting to use the McDonald's App for the first time, but that's a different story... As soon as you order, you sit down and your meal is actually brought out to you by a staff member. I've had some bad experiences here with food: cold fries, missing items, and most recently, I watched my breakfast burrito get microwaved first thing in the morning when it should be freshly made. It's fast food and that happens. You almost have to go in with the mindset that your order is going to somehow get screwed up. The good experiences outnumber the bad ones at any fast food place and that's fine with me. My favorite thing about this location is there are signs near the doors that read, \"Time Limit: 30 minutes while consuming food.\" I would love to be there the day that actually decide to enforce that statement.","stars":3.0}

Hours later, after picking up, my car my tire pressure light is still on.

For dinner I had the Kona Poke with Sushi rice, green onion, avocado, seaweed salad, cucumber, macadamia nuts, Hawaiian poke sauce with tuna. It was nice and fresh but didn't have the flavor that I was looking for and not enough tuna in my opinion. My friend had the Cilantro Lime Chicken Yogurt-lime marinated chicken skewers, cilantro, pickled red onions, turmeric-almond rice, saut\u00e9ed broccolini.

When you are waiting try the proscutto-wrapped baked boccincini. It comes in a tangy homemade tomato sauce and is perfect for sharing with your date.

I like it for vegetarian options but not enough to skip cooking unless I have to. Atmosphere is somewhat of a beachy feeling and it's good for outdoor seating too.

{"text":"Worst experience at a BMW dealership. I just moved here after going to a wonderful dealership for the past 8 years and expected the kind of service I was used to. Not the case. I'll drive my car back to NC before I come back here again. I had a vehicle check brake light come on and scheduled the appointment to also have my airbag replaced for the recall. When they called with the assessment of the work that needed to be done, they said the front brakes needed to be replaced and that when I had my rear brakes replaced by my other dealership 3 months prior, they failed to replace the sensor. I told them to hold off on doing any of the repairs so that I could contact my previous dealership about the sensor and about what was covered by the warranty because it may be more prudent to take it back to NC. She said that was fine and I could let her know in the morning, as it was already after hours in NC. The warranty issue I had addressed with another guy who helped me when I walked in because she had been on the phone the entire time rather than helping me herself, so she had no clue what I was talking about. I woke up to them having invoiced me saying the work was complete when they were supposed to wait for my okay, charging me for the brakes and the sensor, even though I did not authorize it. My original dealership said that there was really no way that they hadn't replaced the sensor because it comes in a kit and that they would have liked to take a look at it to make sure but can't now because this dealership had already done the work. My original dealership asked that I ask to have the sensor they replaced because it sounded fishy to them too (plus I was already charged for the original sensor when I first had the brakes replaced). They also did not at all replace the airbag or mention that when they called. In addition, they wasted two days of our time telling us they'd call us back shortly and we had to call multiple times with many unsuccessful attempts at reaching them in order to pick up the car. Maybe she was also sitting on the phone all day the next day too? They ended up removing the sensor from the invoice, but it took the director of parts and service from my original dealership going through the records and standing by their work to resolve the issue. Two days of frustration on the phone for a luxury dealership is just unacceptable, but I guess they figure they can get away with it being the only BMW dealership in Nashville. I hope their new location doesn't have these same problems, but I'm not sure it's worth finding.","stars":1.0}

My Vet referred me to a different company in which I immediately felt a sense of coldness when speaking to owner and felt my baby would not be treated with dignity. I phoned EVERY cremation company in the area and it wasn't until I spoke with Elaine that my spirt felt a sense of calmness and relief. Elaine walked me through the process and reassured me that my baby will be cremated with dignity and that I can be present during the private cremation. I toured the facility beforehand and met Christy. I was still inconsolable and in disbelief and Christy was also very supportive as I had no support system in town at the time. I was an emotional wreck. Steve pick up my boy from the Vet and phoned me the night before his private cremation. On the day of cremation, Jessica facilitated the cremation. Once again I was met with kindness, warmth and support. She allowed private time with him in which I did not feel rushed, and she throughly explained every step and invited my participation in starting the process. Words cannot express my gratitude of the care and respect Beloved Pets provided to my lil boy JP (16y.0 toy poodle). Steve, Elaine, Jessica and Christy thank you thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm so glad I found you (I'm still crying as I write this). If I could give a million stars I would!!!!","stars":5.0}

The atmosphere was outstanding along with the service. Jordan was our server and was very accommodating all night long. We ordered an aged New York strip steak , Bone in Ribeye and a Prime Rib. the food was just ok. We had been to Lawrys in Chicago the week before and had prime rib at Lawrys was much better. The strip and rib eye was ok but expected much more for the price point. May try again not sure at this point.","stars":3.0}

Prices were commiserate with atmosphere and food quality. Drinks are priced fairly as well. Open kitchen is small, but also answered why our meals were slow in coming out. As for the deck out back.

Made dinner reservations (via opentable) for a Sunday evening before a show, was seated immediately, and met with very friendly and quick service! Our server was very helpful and suggested cocktails and wines for our particular palettes that ended up being exactly what we needed on an unexpectedly hot day. They have an extensive drink menu so don't be afraid to ask for help\/suggestions if you're not well versed in wine. We started with the chorizo fundido which was deliciously flavorful and cheesy, with a side of 4 small corn tortillas, a perfect indulgent start to our meal. I ordered the spicy diablo shrimp which I didn't think was very spicy at first but it has a hidden heat that sneaks up at you! The sauce is maybe the most delicious I've ever had in a pasta entree, period. My partner order the champagne cod fish and chips and I just had to try it - the cod was PERFECTLY flaky and I may just have to go back to get some myself. I wish we had room for dessert but let me tell you I'm going to be back for dinner and brunch because this restaurant is now going to the top of my Indy faves!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I left one star for this Buca location because Yelp wouldn't let me post -5. Just to lay out a base line: In hopes of celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary, my husband made reservations for 8 pm at this Buca for 5 people which included the both of us and our 3 children. There's a laundry list of issues so I've listed them in bullet format. -Our reservation was for 8 pm. We were seated at almost 8:30. -Our waitress (Madison) finally showed up about 10 minutes later to take our drink order, claiming that she had been in the back loading dishes. She also said they were out of plates, cups, silverware... -Madison told us we couldn't order the strawberry kid's drink for our daughter because they were out of the cups. Hello! You could have just put it in a different cup. -Since we had been sitting there long enough to figure out what we wanted to eat, we went ahead and ordered. She asked us if we wanted garlic bread but we had already ordered an appetizer so I didn't want to buy bread. I vaguely remembered Buca giving complimentary house bread but she didn't mention it nor did she bring us out any. I sat there 3\/4 of the night wondering why other people were getting free bread. -We didn't have enough silverware and had to go up to the bar twice to ask for extra napkins. You would think that being a \"family\" style restaurant this Buca would be conscientious enough to give this family with 3 kids extra napkins. Nope! We had 3 napkins. -Back to the bread thing: I ended up asking another waitress about the bread and she instantly knew I was referring to the house bread. Brought us the bread, olive oil and oh, extra napkins within a minute. Wish we would have gotten her instead. There's wasn't an ounce of garlic on the bread. -Finally our food arrives, just to find out that one of our entrees was given to a different table. So more waiting for us... -We finally get our missing entree just to find out that it was watered down and tasteless. Apparently while rushing to remake it, the cooks didn't drain the noodles enough so the water they boiled them in had diluted the \"butter sauce\" while sitting on the plate. Our Shrimp Florentine looked like a plate full of boiled fettuccine noodles topped with boiled shrimp and a hand full of spinach leaves. -To add to our very \"special\" anniversary dinner, we had the opportunity of hearing the manager (Jeff) tell the family sitting right behind us that he had married his wife on Christmas and then handed her divorce papers on Christmas, just to she would remember that day. At this point I had had enough so I turned to him and thanked him for his very touching story while we were \"celebrating\" our wedding anniversary. -To end this spectacular night, our waitress even made sure to come back to our table to ask us for","stars":1.0}

It was good that we had a smallish group since it was the 4th of July and the streets were busy. Joe was a really good tour guide. He was a little quiet, but I think that just drew you into the stories he would tell. We made 5 different stops roughly in our 2.5 hour tour. It was really helpful since Joe would tell you what drinks the next bar specialized in, so that you could try something new. Besides talking about booze, Joe gives lots of insights into NOLA history and culture. There was even a close encounter with a ghost! Our tour started at 4 which worked out well so we could go get some dinner and soak it up when we were done, then check out the fireworks. Good times!","stars":4.0}

I had to damn near BEG and PLEAD for insanely subpar service in order to spend a nice chunk of change on a watch. It's important to note that while I was being treated like absolute crap, my paler, blonder friend was being bombarded with \"ma'ams, \"did you want to see anything up close?\" and \"how can I help you\"s although her only purpose in the store was to accompany ME in spending a considerable amount of money.

Chicken is nice and tender. loved the sides of corn, muffin, beans and slaw. Our waiter was so sweet. She checked up on us constantly and gave us a choice of BBQ sauce to take home.

I ordered my chicken with buttermilk ranch dry seasoning and I'd put that dry seasoning on everything if I could. The chicken itself was moist, tender, crunchy on the outside and perfect on the inside. The honey doughnut that came with it was perfect as always. My family, who had never had the joy of eating Federal Donuts, chose not to get any but once they tasted mine, they all ran back in line to get their own order. I was disappointed they don't give the pickles here, as I really like the tang of the pickle to cut through the sweetness and heaviness of the rest of the meal. I was also happy they didn't raise the price of the meal just because it's at the ballpark. Spending $9 here will get you the same meal (minus pickles) as it will at the other locations.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO THE CASINOS!! After a horrible experience at the Brew Brothers at El Dorado, I'm very happy that the Front Desk Manager at Harrahs pointed this place out to me! First off, I love the location. It's amazing what a difference a block will make. On Virginia Street, you have to trip over bums and weird guys shouting at the top of their lungs some unintelligeable comment. Go one block west to Sierra Street and a totally different story!! I saw younger people, professionals, and people just out on the town. Not one vagrant to be found. The Silver Peak Tap Room has a great urban atmosphere minus all the negatives. The beer was something else! Their selection was incredible! I ordered a sampler and they brought about 12 different types of beers to my table! All of them were great!! The food was pretty good, big portions, and the price was very reasonable as well. The thing that made the difference for me however was the great service! The waitress was very attentive, friendly, but not too nosy or pushy. There was a very relaxed environment inside, everyone was friendly, and overall I had a great time. Brew Brothers loss was Silver Peaks gain! I definitely recommend anyone who finds themselves in Reno and doesn't want to trip over vagrants or swim through a cloud of smoke, to give Silver Peaks a shot!!!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Yeah... so based on the strong reviews, I was really excited for this place, but I ended up pretty disappointed. I'm from a part of Maryland with a fairly large Afghan community (and a ton of great Afghan restaurants), but I've tried to factor out the \"wow this is worse than what I'm used to.\" Basically, if the food cost $5 here, this place would be alright, but for $15 (dinner price for the Sansom mixed kabob), you get a few, small, dry, un-spiced kabobs on a bed of dry-ish rice with a piece of Afghan bread that is about 20% as good as it can be. I mean, it's not the worst food ever, and it's probably closer to two and a half stars, but the price (and the misleading fact that they only publish their lunch prices online and on their takeout menu, which are almost half the dinner prices) keeps it to two. I will say that I got takeout, but everyone seemed super nice working there, and the place itself was pretty cool.","stars":2.0}

There were five of us on a recent Saturday, and we ate it all. Bloody Marys, fancy cocktails, fruit, Lancaster ham, eggs, pancakes...good Lord, people, we tore it up and loved every minute of it. My only complaint is that there was so much to choose from, I had a hard time deciding. I can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner. Wine list, here I come! We called ahead to reserve a table. I think that was a smart move on our part. Me eating so much that I had to unbutton my pants? Not so much.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"My apartment is very nice, but the management is slimey. They use every trick to extract your last dime here. Rent increases every year to ridiculous levels, and once you sign the contract \"we never said that\" is the usual answer. Right now a commercial tenant (our grocery store) lost its lease during Covid, when we need a food store more than ever. They are replacing it with a tenant willing to pay more. Last summer they started charging $2500 for tented cabanas by the pool when they were always free. It is offensive to sit by the pool with no one using it, because that free shade now costs four figures. They need to replace resident relations with a manager who understands customer service and can treat residents with respect.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I just don't want to write a bad review, but after talking with Stephanie this afternoon and getting no resolution I feel it's worth it. No need to name call, just the facts of what happened. I ordered 3 round cakes for a baby shower. All vanilla cakes with vanilla buttercream icing. One was a naked cake. It was supposed to be simple with slight scalloped edges on top. It was a disaster and looked so unprofessional everyone who has seen it couldn't believe that I paid money for it. We were going to stick the naked cake on top of another round, however all the round cakes came with a ring of buttercream roses on top. I was never told that there would be roses. Apparently this is their standard, but no one mentioned it to me, so how would I know it would be on there? Also when I stacked the cakes, the naked cake icing was a different color than the other two cakes. All the same icing, one super white and the other two were a yellow color. They tasted different and I know what the frosting should taste like since I had a sample of it before ordering. Obviously they messed up the icing on two of the cakes. Stephanie explained that they didn't know I would be stacking it so it didn't seem like it would matter. All the cakes were also supposed to be on cardboard that was cut to the size of the bottom of the cakes. Stephanie and I spoke about this on the phone and I emailed her a confirmation that this would be done. Naturally, they weren't cut so they stood out terribly on our cake base. Plus we had to take the naked cake off of its cardboard base so we could stack it, which was just annoying and unnecessary. Also the cakes were dry. It was just so disappointing all around. I really wanted to like this bakery, but for how many things they got wrong and then to not give me a refund considering the issues were their fault, I'm astounded.","stars":1.0}

But, it's been awhile, and today was such a disappointment. We asked to sit outside in smoking and were shown to Hemingway's cafe area. Disgusting! Made us feel worse for asking for 'smoking'!! Dirty tabletops and seating with small, extremely uncomfortable metal, backless stools, while the rest of the outdoor diners enjoyed lovely tables and comfortable chairs! I do give cudos to the young man who served us! Pleasant, efficient and knowledgeable. Now, about the food.....loved the complimentary pineapple 'salsa' and crispy chips! (Something new). The fish dip was good not great, but the tortilla chips served with it were flavorless. Our meals, which were ample in size, included the grouper rueben...flat and flavorless, a grilled grouper sandwich which was OK. Both at MKT pricing! (No pricing on the menu).

I'd had my eye on this place for some time now being that there aren't many restaurants in the area offering this type of cuisine. The weather in STL was amazing on yesterday, so I decided to treat my Mom to brunch. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by the hostess who was kind enough to ask if we preferred to sit near or away from the music (live band). Once we were seated, our server (can't remember his name) presented us with water while we browsed the menu. My Mom chose the pork chop entree while I opted for biscuits with andouille gravy house potatoes and an egg (potatoes and egg were ala cart). While listening to the band and checking out the smooth dance moves of a few patrons, we admired the atmosphere. Nothing fancy but overall the place was nicely set up with decorative decor throughout. After a short time our waiter presented our meals. Everything looked amazing. Now it's time for a taste test! The pork chop was well seasoned, tender and grilled perfectly. The biscuits and gravy were delightful. My mom kindly asked for a side of gravy (she's a huge fan of biscuits and gravy - Extra $4 for a side of gravy) The potatoes were decent. My fried egg. Not so much. I asked for a fried egg with the yolk fully cooked. I'm not sure what happened but it was barely edible. The edges, bottom and the yolk were way over cooked. As we finished up our meals we looked for our waiter who was MIA for quite sometime. Maybe he took a quick break as the restaurant was quite full. Nevertheless, he finally reappeared and we asked for the check and a to go container. Overall, I was not that impressed with brunch. I spent approximately $43 (not including the tip) and can honestly say that I've had many more options elsewhere for way less. In closing, I will definitely try this place again simply because I am a fan of this type of food and I believe in second chances.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"A 5 star venue. Top notch performances. One of the best hockey teams in North America. Seating is great. Even nosebleed seats had great views. Was there for the Chicago Blackhawk game. Maybe more Hawks fans then BOLTS fans. But was a fun night. Entering the arena was hassle free as long as you adhear to the security directions. Food was on the pricy side but these days where can you go for a quality burger for under $10.00. Parking is no diiferent then any other downtown city sports complex. Fans were loud but polite. All in all was a great time. Waiting to attend a concert in the near future .","stars":5.0}

I saw online they had pecan encrusted mahi with tomato and avocado salad on the menu, but I didn't see it. The waiter said it was a special and that I could still order it. It was so good it literally melted in my mouth. RJ ordered a filet cooked rare and I have never seen one that big. He let me taste it, and it was cooked perfectly. I could cut it with a butter knife.

{"text":"Just no. I'm a local and love supporting our small businesses, but sadly this place is not deserving of anyone's hard earned money. First off, my daughter and I waited over ten minutes to be seated while the hostess ignored us. We were the only ones waiting. Finally a nice waiter seated us. After we were seated we waited another ten minutes before someone came to our table. Finally, the food came out and I was hoping this would be the redemption. Nope. It was gross. All of it. And that's a lot coming from me- Im very easy to please. Everything was pre-packaged and salty, and the enchilada and burrito I ordered were nothing more than packaged taco meat shoved in a big and small tortilla then smothered in...wait for it...watered down pizza sauce lol. It's actually pretty funny. We took a few bites then just asked for the check. The place was pretty dirty to boot and I was just grossed out. Please heed the advice on these reviews and patronize another establishment in our beautiful neighborhood. These folks aren't even trying. :(","stars":1.0}

The food was delicious. This is authentic and delicious Italian food, and you know the food is good when you're looking through the Yelp pictures, except it tastes ten times better. The bread they give you in the beginning has a cake like texture, and the green cilantro, parsley oil they provided for you to dip the bread in is so delicious. For dinner, we started with the fried calamari and fried smelts, both were good. The calamari was pretty standard and the fried smelts were a lil fishy, but we like that so that's okay with us. The servers would perform live opera every so often during our meal, we probably heard 4 servers sing while we were there. They were truly talented and their voices amazing. Definitely made for a cool dining experience. For our main dishes, my party had the Prince Igor, Fra Diavolo, Dido & Aeneas, Pasta Caruso and the Branzino. Everyone pretty much devoured everything on their plates. Unfortunately when it came to dessert, I was too full, the dessert menu presented many choices that were very tempting and hard to choose from. Finally, my husband and my brother-in-law decided on the tiramisu and the panna cotta and both said they were delicious.","stars":5.0}

My granddaughter would always want Cracker Barrell, but since going to Lenny's, she now has a new favorite. She's four years old and loves the raisin bread. When we go, I have to get two extra loaves for her to take home. When shes out of bread, she lets me know that we have to go to Lenny's. I had the BLT Benidict. Oh my, this dish is worth every penny. If you can finish it, you need to take a nap. Needles to say, the ride back home is a little uncomfortable, but worth it. The decor is a little old, but quant. There's plenty to see and read on the walls while you wait for your food. The wait staff never lets a coffee or drink glass get empty. They move around the multiple dining rooms like you're watching a stage show. I wished I lived closer to go mre often, but I know that I'd spend all of my time and eat many meals a week there.They have a guy doing balloon art for the young and old alike.

{"text":"just relocated to Tampa area from North Carolina & I was in the need of getting my hair highlighted, so I read reviews & decided to try this salon. I reached out to one of the stylists, Hannah, as I had seen some of her highlights on others online & scheduled an appointment. I had sent her a photo of my hair, and when I arrived at my appointment on Monday I showed her one of her clients hair colors that I liked & I also gave her the info on the color my hair stylist in NC used on me, told her to decide which was best, she never went over ANYTHING with me, in fact she didn't speak much in my entire 3 hour appointment (I've never had a PARTIAL hair highlight take 3 hours) at this point I was concerned, I had read the pricing on salon 705 website and partial highlights started at $85 - I was charged $240!! She butchered my husbands hair in a 5 minute cut, it's gapped all over and he's probably going to shave his head. She spent 3 hours adding foils to ONLY the top part of my hair and charged a total of $240! I almost fell over. I've never paid this for my hair in my life. My husband and I just paid it and left, we both felt sick and so I texted Hannah and asked for a breakdown of a receipt, which she sent me a receipt that only said $240, so I had no idea what she charged for my husbands butchered cut, or what she charged me for just the top part of my head being foiled, she told me that it was $240 because she ALSO cut my hair (she BARELY trimmed a few split ends and I mean barely ! I would think a trim would be included in a service such as highlighting but if not, maybe she should have told me it was going to be EXTRA for my few split ends to be snipped and she also told me via text that she had to use a different highlight technique with her foils because of my root color & because I had dark underneath (I've been getting partial highlights for YEARS and never seen a technique that takes 3 hours) but Hannah said she had to use this technique because I was \"phasing my lowlights out\" , ummm I haven't had lowlights in years, I simply get highlights throughout my hair and leave the underneath darker, why wouldn't she advise me or disclose to me before doing these things? Instead she tells me she STARTS at $85 an HOUR! Are you kidding me?? You're barely out of hair school, you totally robbed me by spending 3 hours on PARTIAL foils that made no difference in my hair and my roots are STILL dark! I can't even tell that I had my hair done!! I basically got robbed because you thought I was new to the area and that you could take","stars":1.0}

Would totally be a 5 star but the valet parking at the hotel lost my keys, and I had to cab it to my first appointment in the morning, after waiting 30 minutes and being told they were bringing my car right up. Finally they admitted they couldnt find my keys (and said i must have them... Sorry, my car is kinda fancy, and an alarm sounds when the keys leave it as a security detail. I think they were joyriding). Not the way to start your business day. When I returned, they had the keys. The hotel and the parking people made no offers to: pay for my cab rides, or comp the $38 charge for parking. Not a huge deal, but a detail that a 5 star would have caught. Anyway..... You hopefully have better luck! This place is really attractive (so is most of the staff!). The design is retro 1930's NYC vibe... Concierge very helpful and informed, AWESOME workout space for a hotel, great view from the room overlooking the city and river, comfy bed, good air controls, quiet.

Big Kahuna's also offers a variety of appetizers (jalapeno poppers, buffalo wings, potato wedges, etc), kids meals, sandwiches, pasta, salads and calzones.

Once a server finally paid attention to me at the front door, she was pretty friendly, but I still had to drive the experience (asking for a menu, getting a burdened response when asking a menu clarification, having to ask again for a wine list whilst waiting for my take out order)... The good and the bad of very young restauranteurs -- creativity with the food, yet shoddy, unsure service. Will try again on account of the quality of the food and it being new and all. Bad news: I'm gonna not exaggerate here... On a Monday night with a half-full restaurant it took 40 minutes for me to get ONE BURGER TO GO. Seriously not exaggerating. Was never offered water. Had to ask for my check... Felt kinda bummed as I just popped in to grab a burger. I have to admit the burger was great. The fries were mediocre (soggy -- yes I busted into them before I left the restaurant!) Go if you have time time time to spend, but not if you need a quick and efficient bite.

{"text":"Well, I am willing to give it one more shot. I want to give the benefit of the doubt as this place is new and hopefully working the kinks out. Went here with my husband to check out the new spot in the neighborhood. A lot of opportunities presented themselves on our visit. A bartender came up immediately with menus (yay) and she seemed pretty friendly. She came back around no 40 seconds later, \"Ready to order!?\" -- we politely told her we needed more time...she huffed and rolled her eyes. Pardon us for needing a hot second. 15 minutes later a male bartender asked if we were ready...yes, yes we were. The menu stated 12 wings for $12.00. I ordered the wings and my husband ordered the burger with dipping sauce. We each ordered a beer...the first two we tried to order were not available. The drink list itself is VERY pricey for cocktails or for ordering bourbons neat. We are not in Center City, San Francisco, or Manhattan. We are at a neighborhood bar. I know what a neat bourbon should cost or what a Titos & tonic should cost. This is a HUGE miss for me. Anyway, the food arrives. My husband did enjoy the burger with dipping sauce. He said would order it again. The wings were great -- BUT there were only 8 wings NOT the 12 listed on the menu. The male bartender never came back to check on us. By the time we were done we had to flag him down for the check...I couldn't even tell him I was missing 4 wings. When we finally got his attention he behaved like the female bartender, very huffy and a lot of eye rolling. What really kills me is that I reached out to the restaurant on Instagram to let them know about the wings (in a polite way) and my comment was DELETED. As I said...I will give this one more try. Opportunities include a staff that at least seems like they enjoy their job, get the menu portions and pricing correct, and lower the price of your drinks. I will reiterate -- this is a neighborhood spot, please price it like one.","stars":2.0}

I had a bacon\/egg\/cheese wrap, which was far larger than I expected. The husband had a double bacon cheese burger with fries. Also far larger than we expected. No, not fresh ground beef, probably those patties that they get from SYSCO, but still tasty. The staff was very friendly, very attentive. We weren't even sure they were open today, but they were, until 2pm. Since we arrived at 1:15, they were more than accommodating to us. Our cups never went empty and the food came out -very- quickly.

After a weird encounter my first time around--where they were not even busy yet wouldn't seat us because they were 'slammed', I gave it a pass because I've been in the service industry before and understand there are off days, but after this second time, I will not be returning. Aside from the general rudeness throughout the meal, the icing on the cake was when we had been waiting quite a bit of time for our waitress to come over so we could ask for more coffee, the hostess finally walked by and when we asked for coffee she stopped (directly next to the coffee stand) and said, \"that's not my job, I'm the hostess\". WOW. I'm sorry, but she could have easily said sure and then gotten our waitress to grab us coffee! She walked away smugly and shortly there after our waitress came over.

{"text":"I like this store. I really do. They have interesting, fun things -- things you don't necessarily see in other stores -- and they're purporting to do something great for global economies and supporting artisans in 3rd world countries. However, after traveling through 3rd world countries and seeing some of the same items in these stores for so much more than you would ever pay abroad, I find it nearly impossible to purchase anything here at this point. For example, after going to South America I stopped into this store and saw an alpaca pullover for $400!!!! That same item would cost maybe $20 in South America, probably less if you're a great negotiator. I understand that there are import fees, travel fees, and other overhead costs involved in running a business -- no, really, I do -- but I feel as though this store tries to make it sound as if so much more money goes to the artisan, when, in fact, I don't think that's true. So while I'm happy that this store (chain, really) keeps people fed, clothed, and housed in developing nations, I'm not sure their marketing practices aren't without deception. And, yes, I understand that livable wages vary from region to region, so what the artisans actually receive may be a \"fair\" wage where they live, but the wage they're receiving hardly renders them much above poverty. Meanwhile, this chain is pocketing a hefty sum (see example above) for those artisans' wares. I'll continue to stop in from time to time, but I'm more likely to stimulate other economies by actually visiting the countries and buying directly from the artisans.","stars":3.0}

Upon walking in I thought, okay, this looks like a BBQ joint. Nothing to write home about, per se, nice and classic, but when I walked upstairs, whoa, that was the Martin's I wanted to see! The upstairs is amazing. The vibe, perfect. When you reach the top of the stairs, you enter a courtyard with picnic tables. On either side and slightly behind you are two bars. There is also a ping pong room, dart alley, high top standing tables, small living rooms with old car seats, and a few private party rooms. I was dining solo so it was easy to grab a car seat and relax without feeling uncomfortable. The design allows you to feel intimate even thought the space is huge. I can't say it enough, they really knocked it out of the park with the second floor. Top notch stuff! The food didn't disappoint either, it was just as great as the other two locations.

I ordered the chicken and shrimp, and got a bowl of soup, salad, fried rice, vegetables, my entree, and noodles for around $17 I believe. All delicious! I will say that I am gluten intolerant and was under the impression that Yamato had gluten free options. The server instead told me that my food would be cooked in the back with no sauce, and I did not want to pay $17 for unseasoned food. I ate the regular gluten-y food. I suffered later, but it was delicious. :)","stars":4.0}

Grains, root vegetables, soups, salads, bread, desserts, beer, wine, coffee, cocktails. Celery root velvet soup is thick & savory sweet good. Roasted beet salad is wonderful, surprises with crunchy bits of nutty granola. Table seating & a low counter with stools. Great view of the Monon trail & a long low fire pit outside.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"This company is completely overwhelmed and only interested in making excuses for not fulfilling promises. He completed our 40K backyard redesign (which was a stretch for us) and asked for references only to back out on their bids and make me look like an idiot. He couldn't find multiple plants (that I had had to find on my own; and did, easily). He even planted a tree that was not the type we wanted and made us feel bad for him having to pay for the replacement. When checking the wrong tree, his guys even removed one of our warranted ill plants and didn't tell us...like we didn't notice. DO NOT HIRE!!! He always talks about his great reviews but I think you see that they are mediocre.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Finally made it here last night after wanting to check it out for far too long. I thought the Goat's Beard was a tiny spot, until I walked in and was taken up to the 2nd floor (and noticed there is a 3rd floor!). The menu was relatively small, which I've always considered to a be a good thing. Service was a little slow, but well attentive. Lighting and decor were stylish, but the tables were too close together, making for an overly loud Saturday night dinner. I got the squash soup and winter risotto. The soup was just average. Fried ginger garnish was a nice touch, but I've had better squash soup in the past. The risotto on the other hand was great! Really flavorful. My gf had the Goat's nuggets, which are best described as up-scale, spicy chicken tenders. Really good. Solid draft beer list. Intense whisky list, though I'm not much of a liquor drinker. Price was right at expected for Main Street. I will be back.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"We frequent the tea bar next door and since they are owned by the same person, I wanted to give Hub a try. I was personally not impressed at all. The first thing that struck me as odd was that they do not offer any white chocolate drinks. I've probably been to 20+ different coffee shops on the west coast, never have I been told they cannot make a white chocolate mocha. I decided to still order and went ahead and ordered a small hot coffee with cream, a large iced mocha and a child's hot chocolate. The only person who enjoyed their drink was my little one. The drinks were extremely small, I had asked for a large iced mocha and the drink was just as tiny as the \"small\" hot coffee (which was very small). They do not put lids on anything you order, so I was left trying to take 3 very full drinks over to the other side to put lids on them by myself... I understand that they make \"pretty\" images on top of the drinks, but I would rather have had lids on my to go drinks instead of trying to balance my way over to the other counter with not even an offer of a drink carrier or assistance. Not to mention, for 3 very tiny drinks it was rather expensive. Just not a fan.... We have some really great coffee shops and this was not one of them for me.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Rosepepper is definitely another sweet spot on the east side. Similar to what other people have said, it is pricier than your normal mexican restaurant, but I believe that the quality for the most part, is a little above your standard place as well. For one, their margaritas are amazing. When I was there and I assume that this is always the case, we had Patron Margaritas, and that was not by choice, that is the standard. They are incredible and incredibly strong. The food is also really good, very fresh, and their menu is a little different than most mexican places. If you like spicy, and I mean it will make you sweat spicy, try their verde pork. It has a a lot of flavor and is really good, but only if you can handle it. It was really a little too much for me, but the waitress will let you try it before you order it, just to let you feel the heat. The atmosphere is also cool and original and even a little hip. They also serve sour cream and guacomole in fried tortilla cups, which is pretty awesome as well. Its def a go to place in my neighborhood.","stars":4.0}

Aqimero exceeded my expectations. Us party of girls had arrived late due to inclement weather. Our server granted our request to be quick with the orders and get our bill within the hour. Service was prompt and attentive. Food was excellent. We had the bread with squash butter. Our entrees were the grilled Latin cheese, butternut squash tostadas, and romaine salad. I ordered the picanha steak medium rare. It was the right of flavoring and seasoning. Passion fruit mousse was refreshing.

Had the oyster \"tacos\" while the oysters were fried well - they are not on tacos. It's on a tortilla chip. Seriously?! Maybe bc I'm from cali is why that bothered me so. Hubby had the redfish. It was dry but the veggies were good. Oh yes the alligator bites were super tasty.

{"text":"This place is horrible!!! I went there because I had a gift card, and it was a terrible experience. Multiple staff tried to talk me into getting different services (gel polish) and when I politely declined, they stated \"it's not their fault if your polish gets messed up right away and gets all over my flipflips\". As if I have never gotten my nails painted and have no idea how that works...I finally agreed to help polish on my fingernails just so they would leave me alone. The lady that gave me a manicure and a pedicure talked on her cellphone the whole entire time (had a Bluetooth ear piece). She wore a short dress with her legs wide open the whole time she gave me a pedicure, putting her black underwear on full display. I was just so uncomfortable the whole time! I had to remind her to paint my whole nail (she was painting just the middle of the nail with a huge gap on each side) and she was overall sloppy. They were required to wear a mask due to COVID (and asked all customers to do the same), but her nose was out the whole time she actually wore the mask! At some point during my manicure she took off the mask all together. I would never go back there again! Even having a $50 gift card was not worth the experience. Update: the gel polish on my fingernails started to peel 3 days later! I have had gel manicures many times from other salons, and that has never happened before!","stars":1.0}
{"text":"This Cuban was perfect! Bread fresh, an inch thick pile of cold cuts, flavorful pork, and it was huge! Can I say that again? HUGE! It was so good, I had to try something else from the menu. So, I went with the garbanzo bean soup, which was savory, and full of beans, potatoes, and pork. So good, I ordered some to take home. I was on a run, so I decided to try the homemade flan, neatly stacked in their ramekins. The flans was rich, creamy, and modestly sweet, with the perfect amount of vanilla. At this point they were going to have to roll me out the door. All in all, it's well worth the extra few minutes to visit Perera for a Cuban sandwich and a soda. Be daring try some of the other items. On another note, the place was super clean. The staff incredibly polite. I noticed the chef was hand breading fish fillets, which no one takes the time to do anymore. Genuine from-scratch cooking and care. Next time I'm trying the fish dish. Enjoy!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I have a lot of love for DeSano. It's now my favorite pizza on the west side of the river. We (my family) tried it this afternoon, right after work at 6:00. It was only moderately busy so we had a chance to figure things out. We were a little clueless about how the system worked, but the employees were very nice, patient, and gave my 16-month old a lot of well-received attention. That's not what I expected because DeSano's menu and website give off a high-falutin' vibe (the salt is from the Mediterranean and the flour is imported, etc). When you first walk in, there are two registers where you place your order. There's plenty of room to grab a menu and take a long look off to the side. There's a wide variety of bottled drinks, or you can BYOB. After you order, there are several sets of bench-style seating (think Hattie Bs and Burger Up). The tables have buckets of plastic utensils and rolls of paper towels. The oven area is wide-open, and at the little bar area in front there's an assortment of spices, balsamic vinegar, and olive oil from which you can make a concoction to dip your crust in. The pizza is brought out on wax paper in a metal pan. One pizza was perfect for myself and my wife. We have moderate appetites. If you're a big eater you might want to consider getting salad or getting two pizzas and taking some back home. As other reviews have mentioned, the pizza comes out super-quick because it's cooked in volcanic rock ovens at ~900F. This makes it a great choice for a business lunch. The only slight downside to this is that a few tiny bubbles at the edge of your crust get charred. If you try to avoid eating charred things, a quick brush with the knife knocks the paper-thin burnt crust right off. The pizza itself is fantastic. The ingredients are super high-quality. The crust is average thickness, and you can really taste the freshness. The sauce is slightly sweet but also savory, and the pizza has wonderful cheese but not an abundance of it. For me it was the perfect balance. It's also not greasy. I would say this pizza is pretty similar to Five Points on the east side, and these two places are neck-and-neck for my overall favorite.","stars":5.0}

I had a their mango special last night and it was DELICIOUS. Big chunks of really ripe delicious mango with shrimp, scallops, pineapple and onions. YUMMM. My friends had the Pad Ginger with shrimp and the tofu red curry. All the dishes were super tasty and the veggies really fresh. Love the ginger in the pad ginger.

I have never left a salon needing to go home and actually cut my cuticles myself on my hands and toes. It was really bizarre and I felt worse rather than and cleaned up.

The highest priced entree is $12. If you're seeking good grub and that \"real Bywater experience\" look no further this is it - The Wandering Buddha is tucked away behind the Hi Ho Lounge on historic St. Claude Avenue. Even if you're not a vegan or vegetarian I guarantee you'll love this place. Don't be fooled by the clich\u00e9 statement \"vegan food is probably bland and tasteless\" because it's not and The Wandering Buddha's Korean twist is bursting with flavor.

The original salesman (Scott) we were working with \"handed us off\" to another person who then had a prior client come in.

The interior is a thoughtful blend of modern and rustic finishes. Seating abounds, and the room on the left features a great, casual drinking room. Their beer is brewed in house, and it is on point! I had the IPA and it easily compares to the gold standards you might have. From a local perspective, this spot by far out does Tired Hands and other micro breweries. HOWEVER, the cocktails left no lasting impression, despite their enticing descriptions. For food, we did several of the charcuterie plates. The options, ranging from meatballs to ceviche, were smashing additions to what you might traditionally expect. The Brussels sprouts stole the show for me. A great value for $29. Only complaint would be the almost intentional move from the waiter to leave glasses, plates, etc on our small table. It doesn't make sense to leave empty beer glasses and dirty plates when they are no longer in use. Since we had 9 people, this got to be a little much. Overall though, I can't wait to go back and enjoy more of their food and beer.","stars":4.0}

You'll recognize it by the horse head on the sign. I've spent many a lunch or early evening here with my other grad student friends from Temple, drinking margaritas, or beer, or both, and noshing on their greasy bar food. The food reminds me of a chain (only it's not), with sandwiches, quesedillas, salads, wings, etc. Pretty standard bar food fare, but it's pretty good. The beer selection leaves something to be desired, but I'm into Belgian beer bars, and, hey, it's a college bar with pretty cheap prices for drinks, so I cannot expect more. I usually just order a Corona or Sam Adams and am content. Every time I've been here, my friends and I have always gotten a table quickly, even if we wanted one outside, and our service was always fast. The waitresses and hostesses (who I suspect are Temple undergrads) are really friendly, and this place is really clean. No sticky college bar floors here! And I always bring my food home with me because the portions are so large, the the waitress was nice enough to run after me one day because I'd left my box of food on the table.

She was actually enthusiastic about their donuts, something that is rare among clerks in donut stores. I really like their donuts! My current favorite is a chocolate glazed old fashioned. This is bit of a curiosity to me as I definitely prefer a yeast donut to a cake donut 9 times out of 10. Ray's is very clearly the 10th time as I can't seem to order anything else lately. Their version is dense without being dry...a feat most places can't accomplish. I bring donuts to customers 2-3 times per month.

{"text":"Panera is the go-to place when my friends and I are completely indecisive! We stick with what's around and what we know. You have to dabble around the menu to find something you like! I am a fan of their vegetarian choices, they are quite flavorful and all their ingredients are fresh and vibrant. The staff is hard working, from what I've seen. My absolute favorite was the hummus power bowl but it has been discarded from the menu! I'll stick to the mediterranean sand which! What I found odd is sometimes they would switch up the bread for that order. Some are white, some are a tinted red. With every order I accompany it with the refreshing iced green tea or green power smoothie(?) It's definitely something to crave on a hot day. The parking is such a hassle! Though not the restaurants fault of course, finding a parking spot relatively near the restaurant is a lucky find! It's a relaxing place to study indoors, wifi is provided. It could get a bit chilly inside, but they have an outdoors area as well! As for most orders they come with a 99c pastry item which is hard to pass up.. But when you get the chance, if you think you'll like it then definitely try out the carrot cupcake! The icing is nice and think with a candy carrot on top for decor\/ a garnish. Some orders are rushed but all in all its a pretty good place.","stars":3.0}

Anyway, as soon as we walked in the door, we were ignored. I couldn't figure out if it was seat yourself. But after one server passed us cussing and slamming things about three times, we decided to seat ourselves. Luckily our server was NOT this server who continued to yell and throw a fit the ENTIRE time we were there. Our server was nice enough. He got our order pretty quick. We didnt really see him again until it was time to pay. Our food came and my food was half cold. Like not edible cold. As someone who worked in the service industry throughout college, I HATE sending food back. But I really didn't want ice cold biscuits and gravy, so I kindly asked them to microwave it. The kitchen and servers made a HUGE deal. I mean you can SEE them right there. A busser or hostess came back and told me that the kitchen was making me a brand new plate instead of microwaving so it would take a few minutes. So I waited. And then she brought back my old plate, microwaved, and turned around from where I took a bite. I mean that's fine, but don't tell me I'm waiting 10 minutes for my plate to be microwaved. In addition to all of this, my boyfriend's hash browns in his skillet were all white, watery, and cold... Being from Webster as a kid and wanting to check the place out, I was highly dissapointed.","stars":1.0}

She instead argued with me, she called out her manager, and he argued with me TOO. I was in complete shock as my family owns a restaurant plus I am a waitress myself. So I just paid the full bill and wanted exit as quickly as possible. Also, we came here for line dancing. everyone recommended it as a main event.

They offer a variety of croissants, freshly baked breads, scones, muffins, cupcakes, and breakfast and lunch items. I came to pick up their (very moist and delicious) cupcakes, and I ended up trying their spinach and cheese and ham and cheese croissants fresh out of the oven last time, and they were simply heavenly. This time, I picked up almond, fig & Brie, plain, chocolate, and salmon and cream cheese croissants for breakfast, again, fresh out of the oven, and they're dangerous.

It has been 7 weeks and for the past 3 weeks we have been told it will come in that week. Called today and it will be at least 2 more weeks for it to come in. We have spent thousands of dollars here but after seeing the other reviews here I should not be surprised about this issues and we be taking my business elsewhere. Please save yourself the trouble and go to Raymore and Flanigan Update, took 13 weeks to get a dresser. They never returned the many phone calls in the process of trying to find when we would get our dresser. We went in, was told we'd get a call Wednesday, never called cause morons run this place. Went back Thursday, and they had given my dresser to someone else so they had to take a different orders to fill mine. Finally got it. Please, I implore you, don't go here.

However, when they set down the chips you can tell they're freshly made in-house, and it just goes on from there. I enjoyed a flat enchilada, which tasted like crispy fried cornbread. Even my stepdaughter's quesadillas were clearly made on homemade tortillas and tasted amazing. Hubby ate a large number of shrimp wrapped in bacon, which probably need no further explanation. My father-in-law had regular enchiladas, which I did not taste, or ask him about, but his plate was completely clean at the end of the meal. The only thing that didn't go over well was stepson's green chile tamale, which was very dry and very sweet.

The escolar nigiri was thin and lovely but much too thick on the sashimi as was the rest of the pieces.

I started getting nauseous about 15 minutes after dinner and it continued all night. Florida is on the wrong side of the country for sushi.","stars":2.0}

Everything here is made out of wood and it truely feels like you are out in the woods somewhere and not miles from downtown. We came on a Sunday evening with my family who has never been here before and the service was extremely slow. If it was busy I would understand, but Big Woods was dead. The bartender was nice enough did help. We ordered pretzels sticks as an appetizer together. The appetizer was quite good. The mustard and cheese sauces tastes like they were made in house and was something I would order again. For those who do not like horseradish I would caution you to take a tiny sample of the mustard before going all out. After that the dinners were kind of rough. I ordered poutine with steak tips. The gravy was as thin as water and the cheese curds were not well melted and oozing at all. It can be hard to make a good poutine so I know the risk you run ordering it. My brother in law ordered a fried chicken sandwich and there were very simple mistakes made, like serving the sandwich with burned buns and a soppy not crispy chicken. The rest of the meals my family enjoyed. I simply wish there was more attention to detail given to the food that was served. That being said I would come here again to try other things as I have heard plenty of good things and may have just picked the wrong menu item.","stars":2.0}

Saw that this place has decent Yelp reviews so I took a leap of faith. Parking lot: no lines, super rough gravel, dark in a super sketch part of town. There was maybe 2 other cars there. To be honest I was pretty scared of walking alone into and out of the restaurant. Ambience: I can't stand the 80's overly cheesy Chinese decorations in so many Tucson Asian restaurant. It's 2016! Show off our own cultural decor and identity with pride. Come onnnnnnn. The whole time I was waiting for my food, there were 2 tables with leftover food sitting there for a long-time without being wiped down, isn't that a sanitary hazard? Food: Pho dac biet with err'thang. It came with a solid portion of meat, but some of the meat tasted a bit old... The broth was pretty bland, I had to put some extra fish sauce in at home. The bean sprouts and herbs were pretty old and soggy, URGH. Ioono, overall I was just hugely disappointed with Tucson's Viet food scene, again. *TEARS* ALSO! I wanted my pho to-go and the noodles uncooked on the side (just something my g-ma taught me to keep the noodles from being over cooked) I overheard the cooks in the kitchen made fun of me for wanting uncooked noodles.

I am 23, and ate with a group of 23-30 year olds. After scarfing down my jambalaya, the waitress scurried over and said \"umm excuse me...how old are you??\" I politely replied with my age, to which she replied \"oh good, we thought you were 14 and not allowed here.\" Just sort of a bizarre experience, considering I've never had a problem with not looking my age.","stars":5.0}

I woulda enjoyed more royales :( but overall, the meat selections were well cooked, seasoned, and not dry which is a plus plus plus. The rest of the trough though, consisted of carbs carbs and carbs: ten+ biscuits which I thought were too many and just a space filler. They were tasty biscuits but totally too many. There were blueberry glazed donuts (my fav), French crullers which were airy and ok, and probably only one cream filled one that was cut in half. There were a good number of cast iron pancakes which were so thick they were more like corn bread - but still delicious and moist once you cut through the hard shell! Mmmmm and then those loaded potato hashes were something else. Sooo good, basically thick hash browns in the form of baby pancakes. Wish there were more of those. And finally, the frittata was perfectly cooked, moist and flavorful enough to compliment the meats and carbs in the board. Overall, a very tasty meal with good and attentive service. I definitely wanna come back and try their all meat dinner trough :)","stars":5.0}

I'm in customer service too as a job and if that's the way the employees act to customers it's what they should expect to get dished right back at them. You also have to whip down your own cart but they have enough people to check around at the entrance\/exit for thiefs.

{"text":"All this speak about Shaya and then I saw it listed as one of the \"best new restaurants in America\" for 2015... what has taken me so long??!!! AMAZING restaurant highlighting Chef Shaya's Israeli family recipes. Highlighted TIP: Keep it classy New Orleans. The space is beautiful and the patio is a hidden gem, tucked away from the hustle of magazine. The weather was a bit hot but I still decided on outdoors to enjoy some sun. The umbrellas provide a great deal of shade and there are industrial fans to help keep the space cool. I would think night time would be a bit more intimate as I saw candles tucked away. I read almost every review on here before I went to decide on what I was going to eat. The consensus was: #1 Falafel - I decided on the sandwich solely because of Sonia R.'s review. I was sold on \"curry fries with harissa mayo\". #2 Curry Cauliflower hummus - I am obsessed with the cauliflower at Domenica. Certainly this must be good and I can't come here and not have hummus. #3 Baba ganoush - 3 for $15 seemed like the thing to do but alas I was alone. I really want this baba ganoush though!! You can purchase single items for the same price ($5 each). First and foremost, why isn't the hummus on the shared menu?? Likely because its a bit more substantial than the other dips and such in this section but, it certainly would be nice to have basic hummus as an option. Curry Cauliflower hummus was good but I wasn't in love. The cauliflower is fried and was a bit too salty. Perhaps I had my mind on my favorite roasted cauliflower and was dissapointed because of that... the rich salty onions were overpowering the hummus so that too, I couldn't appreciate fully. Reviews claim best falafel ever. In the sandwich, the falafel was overpowered. It was a good sandwich, but I wasn't able to appreciate the falafel. The curry fries are addicting, I will crave those regularly. I was way too stuffed to eat them all and even left overs reheated well although my roomates probably hated me for the strong curry smell through out the apartment. Baba ganoush was perfectly smoky. Don't miss this item! The pita!! oh man the pita... I am ruined. The woman called it some other named bread - I don't think its \"pita bread\". Whatever it is, its so darn good. Light and fluffy pillows is what they should call it. Service was outstanding, not rushed, not slow. I sat and ate a great leisurely lunch.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I won't be returning here again. My 8 month old puppy was hit by a car late one night and this was the only hospital I knew of in Reno open 24 hours. You have to ring a doorbell to be let in to the hospital, which I can understand from a safety standpoint, but when you're holding a 50 pound dog who has a broken leg, waiting is not an option. When I walked in, someone came in and just took my puppy from me and went into the back. Talk about a worried mom! They didn't come out to talk to us for about 20 minutes, leaving me to sit in their inhospitable waiting area. When the doctor finally came out, she had us meet her in the only room they had. She told me about the multiple things that could be wrong with my dog because no one saw how she got hit. Again, she left for a long while before returning with the quote for the overnight hospitalization and treatments. It came out to $1,400, and they wanted it immediately. The doctor stood in the room with us with almost no regard for our privacy while we tried to figure out how to come up with over a thousand dollars in the middle of the night. She just stood there, staring at us, waiting for me to pull out a magic credit card that would pay for everything. She wasn't willing to work with us at all. She just wanted our money. Thankfully, I had some family help me out. We were sent home being told the doctor would call me once the lab and X-ray results would come in, which could take hours. I didn't get a call until 12:30 in the morning. This is when I found out that the facility doesn't perform orthopedic surgery anyways! And my dog's leg was broken! So now, instead of paying for just one hospital visit, I had to pay for two. I honestly just wish they would have referred me to the other 24 hour pet emergency hospital that DOES perform surgery. It would have saved a lot of driving and money. This place has no remorse or empathy for your pet. They just want your money. If you have a pet emergency, I highly suggest Sierra Veterinary Specialists off of Wells.","stars":2.0}

They are very dog friendly, welcoming our pooches with bowls of water. I was impressed with the steak sandwich. I was envisioning something akin to Philly meat (i.e. shredded\/chopped), but instead, it was meaty slices of lean sirloin. Add onions grilled soft, sliced mushrooms and provolone on a crusty bun, and it is one heck of a finger-sucking sammie. Their fresh cut fries are also fabulous, crispy but still fluffy in the middle. They are served with a spicy sauce that I couldn't identify but was happy to devour. I tried my husband's salmon sandwich. It has avocado, bacon, and greens. In theory, it should have been delicious. Unfortunately, the bun was just too thick and the salmon too thin. If proportioned right, this could be a win. Based on Kimmi's review, I started with the wedge salad, and it is definitely a winner. I would love to see more bacon on it, but I probably like bacon more than your average person.

Granted, we weren't seated nearest the bar, but the patio seemed to smell completely smoke-free.","stars":4.0}

I took it to the tech desk in Paterno Library where they told me the motherboard was fried ($800 fix) and my best option was to buy a new computer. Went for a second opinion downtown State College and they told me the same thing, also charged a $50 \"diagnosis fee\". So, being in the tough position - I went to best buy and bought a new macbook thinking my 2012 was toast. Fast forward 2 weeks, finals are over and I'm back in Doylestown . I figured I would take my \"unfixable\" macbook to Blake just to see if he could work some magic on it. Blake told me that my specific model had a factory recall and apple would replace the motherboard free of charge!!!! Blake printed out a sheet and told me to take it to a certified apple retailer and they would fix it free of charge. Blake charged me $0. Blake is a computer wizard.

{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and spaciousness of the restaurant: it used to be a church so there are high vaulted ceilings and overall the open space provides for a comfortable atmosphere. Our server was attentive and hospitable. We ordered the German Sausage Sampler ($13), a Greek Salad with Chicken ($10 + $3 add on for chicken) and the Fish & Chips dinner ($16). 1) German Sausage Sampler: The sausages themselves were very nice and had that characteristic 'grilled flavor' to it. The bread was really enjoyable as well- it was soft and grilled. I would preferred if they had given more- they gave three small pieces on the sampler plate: perhaps a few more would have been perfect for a sampler plate. The German potato salad that came with the sampler was okay (I had higher hopes for this component of the dish), and the sauerkraut didn't seem to be that fresh. I also would preferred if they provided more mustard or another sauce, as there was only one side of mustard which wasn't enough. But, in the end what mattered most were the sausages and bread- and they were both grilled and indeed very good. 2) Greek Salad with Chicken: I was surprised at how good this was, given that its a simpler, healthier alternative. They gave a good portion and had the salad had plenty of olives, feta, and banana peppers. It was tossed in a light dressing and wasn't heavy at all. I was impressed with the quality of the grilled chicken- they freshly grilled the chicken and had a nice char flavor to it. I was happy that the chicken was served hot on the crisp salad. 3) Fish & Chips: The waiter recommended this and he was right on the money- this was a HUGE portion of cod fish. I tried it and the cod was really, really nice- better than the Fish & Chips at many English & Irish Pubs I've tried. It tasted fresh and the batter held on really well to the fish. The fries were good- I would have preferred them a little hotter though. I would also make sure to ask for the malt vinegar when ordering this as it didn't come with the Fish & Chips nor was it on the table. But those are quite minor issues. Again, this was a very large piece of cod which was fried to order and, in my opinion, was well worth the $16 price. As far as food goes I would definitely recommend this place. Its not overly loud so one can have conversion with ease and the space itself is very unique and spacious. The prices are also fair and the portions were on point.

Regardless, they treated us quite well. In fact, the manager was not only keenly interested in finding us things to do, he also offered fine tips on where to meet the lovely ladies of Nashville, as well as midget strippers.

I am also docking a star because the ad for Maryville University in Terminal C with an adorable skunk is no longer there. That is probably one of the most randomly offensive things I can think of. All things considered, as long as the flights are relatively on time and all that, airports don't have to be someplace you want to hang out. And, for what it is worth, I personally have not had problems there since 1997 when I tried walking on with a can of mace (on my keychain), but I was not in trouble. But I am white, and look like a Midwesterner. My husband is north-east Asian, and he has gotten completely different treatment just being 2 feet behind me in lines multiple times through security and boarding aircrafts. The most extreme example was one time the TSA agents were pulling all Asians, not just brown south Asians (unfortunately expected for many post 9\/11), out for extra screening and baggage evisceration. I walked through security right before my husband, and the same women who thanked me was yelling at me 30 seconds later when I grabbed one of our mutual bags, as my husband had already been pulled aside for his extra special treatment. Apparently I was not allowed to touch potential terrorist material? Like I mentioned, all Asians were getting pulled, including a Chinese mom with two very small kids. Really?

I stop in maybe every other week for various things, and I always find exactly what I'm looking for. I usually stop by to stock up on wine because I can never have enough in my house, and the selection is pretty unbeatable. They have little carts with wine boxes on top that you can push around, which is so much easier than trying to hold it all. The best part, though? You'll usually be handed a small glass to taste as you're walking around. Are you sold yet? They have a nice range of prices, but I always find plenty in that $25-30 range that don't break the bank. Every wine I've tried from this place has been incredible. There's much more than wine, though. I recently had a holiday brunch party and was able to create an awesome bloody mary bar using a ton of things from Parker's Table. They sell an amazing spicy bloody mary mixer, great pickles, olives, and all kinds of things that are perfect for a party. A few other words of wisdom: -Check out the cheese counter, you will not be disappointed -If you need a host\/hostess gift, this place has you covered - grab a bottle of wine and one of their unique chocolate selections -If you need to create a gift basket, you can hand-pick whatever you want and they'll wrap it up beautifully -The metered parking outside is a little weird, but I never pay and have never gotten a ticket (I live on the wild side) -The staff is the friendliest I've ever seen, and will carry your heavy box of wine to your car When I think of shopping local, this place is first on my mind.

One couple was lingering, but it looked as if they were just perusing. I went to the cashier, and the man behind the counter sternly told me I needed to get in line on the other side. What line?! There was none. The couple ended up getting food, and I proceeded to order a mango lassi after. It was pre-bottled, and they had three other flavors - one being rose. Many of them appeared to have separated with milk\/yogurt byproducts floating on the top and liquid at the bottom. The man shook it up prior to handing it to me so that it was all homogenized, but I still had my hesitations. The lassi had a slightly sour aftertaste -- as if it had gone bad. Although I was using a regular straw to drink it, there were pieces that came through the straw that resembled curdled milk. I barely drink half of it before throwing it away. I've had mango lassis at a number of other places and is one of my favorite drinks, but this was by far the worst I've ever had.

It took about ten minutes for someone to show up and it was just a bus boy with water. Add on another 25 minutes and not one employee came to our table to take any part of our order including drinks. We decided to get up and leave and they gave no effort but just said with half smile 'sorry.' Unfortunate, but definitely left a bad taste in our mouth.","stars":1.0}

I had pouched eggs with sausage which was served with a small fruit cup and artisan quality whole wheat toast. A freshly made blueberry compose accompanied the meal and was delicious on the extra price of toast. The bottomless coffee was typical of a breakfast restaurant.

{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I do really like their food! However, there's reasons why it's a 3 star rating in my book. There was a Uniboil in my hometown, but I never bothered to try it until they opened in Goleta. The uniboil back in my hometown also made it a 2 concept store with Phresh Teas as well. I've tried their Sichuan spicy broth and healthy tomato, both are solid. I personally pick beef as my meat. Popcorn chicken is the best in SB!! Tastes how it's supposed to be, but over priced at $7 for a basket. Esp since chicken thigh is a really cheap cut of meat! Issues with the store: My 1st visit, I came with my boyfriend and they ran out of popcorn chicken at 5pm....we did end up trying their drinks, also known as Phresh Teas. My gripe is that they don't add enough toppings in their drinks when it's a 50 cent upcharge. There was literally only an inch sized layer of topping. I ordered a Hokkaido milk tea, 1\/2 sweet and I saw that it was powdered, so nothing special. However, even at 1\/2 sugar it was still really sweet as if it was regular sugar. It's probably because of the Hokkaido flavored powder containing sugar already. This is coming from someone who grew up in the 626 and got boba everyday after high school! My bf got the fruit tea, which is good and what I've had before in the 626. Got lychee jelly, but was the same one inch amount inside. Personally I'd prefer chopped fruits than whole though, since it means less of the tea! The chunks are huge and you can only really eat the watermelon spear inside. It's usually lime, lemon, orange, and watermelon, but I'd suggest they mix up other fruit combos as well. 2nd visit, I came with friends and there was plenty of seating. We wanted to sit in against the wall where there was a cushioned bench on one side, but we were told to wait for a table with all chairs. Took over 10 mins to set up one table even though the store wasn't even busy.. The girl wiped the table clean but it was still soaking wet and my friend made a remark about it and the employee just said \"oh it means it's clean!\" I felt that she didn't piece it together that she needed to grab a dry towel to wipe it...so we did end up eating at the table while it was still wet. 3rd visit, I came with friends who were fans of uniboil back in Monterey Park. We ordered and one of my friends wanted the korean army stew, but substitute pork with beef. The manager said we couldn't do that, but my friend stated that the other uniboil she's a regular at are ok with it. The manager said she needed to talk to the other owners if it's allowed, but I don't see why a simple meat swap would be such a","stars":3.0}

Got the meat pizza...it was loaded with meat but was rather soggy. Every time I picked up a slice the toppings would slide off. The sauce was a little bland, if I could get all the toppings on the slice it wasn't too bad but nothing that really stood out. I also got a \"side salad\" and it was good...but...damn, 8 bucks for a side salad!?!?! I would say that it would be worth trying but nearly 40 bucks (including tip) for a can of beer, side salad and a 10\" pizza? The taste didn't meet the price to me.","stars":3.0}

The Summer heirloom tomato salad with arugula and burrata, drizzled with balsamic and olive oil is my favorite to this day. Check their menu out for rotating seasonal salads and soups. You can call ahead and pick it up, or order at the counter and they will bring your food out to you.

{"text":"My parents always used to tell me that if I couldn't say anything nice I shouldn't say anything at all...well, if I chose to follow that advice 24\/7 I wouldn't even be writing my review of Arnaud's \"Jazz\" brunch that I experienced on Valentine's Day 2010. Present in New Orleans since 1918 and billing itself as the ultimate New Orleans experience I at least figured I would get some good Creole food in a nice setting along with some pleasant Jazz - what I got instead was mediocre to bad food, lousy and rushed service, and approximately 8 minutes of Jazz before I was hurried out the door. Preparing my coffee in my standard style with artificial sweetener I hadn't even managed to tear open the packet before my captain arrived, pad open and pen in hand, asking \"so, what can I get you.\" Thankfully I'd already looked at the menu online and knew what I'd be ordering, but this event let me know straight up that we were on a clock - turnover time was of the essence - and as such I began keeping track of time. Orders placed I finished preparing my coffee - a decently nutty and thick blend that lacked the chicory so prominently featured at most of the other restaurants in New Orleans. With a \"put the bread on him\" I received an admirable loaf of French Bread with a peculiar design but excellent flavor, crisp and golden crust, and fluffy interior. Unfortunately, the bread would serve as the best thing I ate while at Arnaud's. Quickly following the arrival of the bread was Shrimp Arnaud - approximately 7 shrimp that were no larger or better than the flash frozen and bagged versions I can get in Ohio. They were served over a tomato and some iceberg lettuce and accompanied with lemon slices. Topping the dish was the \"famous\" tangy remoulade sauce - essentially a thick and pungent orange sauce that tasted largely like curry, paprika, and capers - perhaps some horseradish as well. Poorly conceived and featuring inferior ingredients all I could taste was the sauce - a taste I could do without having experienced. Finishing the shrimp and the tomato the surly man I mentioned hanging the balloons appeared with my second course in hand and \"swapped out\" one plate for the next. No presentation, just one plate collected with right, the other deposited with left. Now less than 10 minutes after being seated I was on course two and there was no jazz in sight or hearing range. Dish two was a lettuce salad topped with Creole vinaigrette - decent but nothing to write home about. Feeling again as if I was being rushed I picked at my salad and ate some bread only to have the surly man come back 7 minutes later and ask if I was \"all done\" with his hand already on the rim of my plate. Stating \"no\" he retracted, walked away, and stood eyeing me from the doorway. When I did finish the plate I moved it","stars":1.0}

The water is pretty clear too, I saw a fish swimming by my feet at one point. They have platforms you can swim out too as well.

{"text":"Overall had a great experience coming here for Sunday morning brunch on a holiday weekend. The setting almost feels right out of a PAUL or Le Pain Quotidien location found along the east coast or in a European city, but is unique for St. Louis. The quiche, avocado toast and coffee we ordered were tasty and good sized. Emily delivered great service, but this location remains chronically understaffed and is consistent with my previous experience here. A big problem is the signage directing diners to \"please set yourself\" which leads to many people sitting down an expecting someone will be by shortly to take their order, however this place runs with a skeleton crew. Emily and the other staff member on duty were both delightful and did their very best, but if a member of management happens to be reading this PLEASE invest in more staff. Your guest experience is suffering as a lack of it and it is placing an undue burden on your staff juggling too many duties at a given time.

There is a fountain in one corner and we were told if we sat over there the trickling water might splash us. I can't imagine getting splashed with water in those temperatures. I had two blankets wrapped around me like a cocoon and I never fully got warm in 45 minutes. I have been to two other salt caves and it was warm and cozy in those. They dimmed the lights way down for most of the session but honestly I would've preferred them to stay on because it gave a nice glow. The music also stopped halfway through the session and so I felt strange in a dark, damp and silent room. A little too cave-y for relaxation, IMO.","stars":3.0}

Most seating is in the form of booths with nice atmosphere, perfectly spaced with like palm leaf style dividers. The whole place is also very clean and organized. I feel the theme is very cohesive and just feels right. The wait can be extensive. Always call ahead. The wait is worth it. I tried one crazy sandwich called the Shark Bite that comes on cheese bread and includes ham, bacon, cream cheese, tabasco sauce and veggies. You know, totally normal, not to mention kosher. It's a great conception and the overall composition is good if you like flavor. The medium is a massive size. It is very rich and filling. Save half.

{"text":"I feel bad for rating so low because their staff the last handful of times I've been back since their re-opening in April have been awesome. Really I think their service is great and none of my comments are a reflection on them. My biggest complaint is the new menus and the quality\/consistency of food within them. I get that there is new ownership and they want it to reflect their vision, so I won't spend a ton of time on this, but I thought their old menu was better. It was simpler, and the food was consistently very good. I thought the crab dip was as good as any in the city and their brunch was a favorite and unlike other brunch items along Main Street in Manayunk. It was just good food, and I never would've gone away from it if it were me. But I get that that's nostalgia and not fair to the current owners. I do wish the old photos of their food could be taken down from The Yelp! Review page, as it doesn't accurately reflect their current offerings. I kind of decided that today was probably my last visit for a while after the brunch we had. As I said before, the old brunch menu was good and different than the rest of Manayunk. The breakfast quesadilla with spicy ketchup was a favorite, especially on a hangover. Anyway, the new menu feels like it's overly complicated, and there wasn't anything that I could just order and feel good or excited about. I ended up with what I thought would be two eggs with some spicy sauce on top and toast, but was actually just one (medium?) egg on top of a ton of spicy (I presume) arrabbiata sauce, and a side of sausage. The sauce was decent, as was the egg, but the toast was bread that was flipped on the griddle and the bottom side was left for way too long, it was all black and burnt, but the middle was still straight bread. They were out of the sausage, but the waitress wasn't made aware and brought out a side of bacon, which was frustrating but she ended up not charging me since it's not what I ordered and I appreciate that. As it turns out that was probably the best part of the entire meal flavor wise. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is the meal was... okay. But considering that it was 14 bucks when you throw in a side of bacon I see absolutely zero value for the level of execution or for the actual amount of food. To me, you can get away with setting a premium if you're serving something that's next level flavorful, but that wasn't the case here. It was thoroughly just okay. And the wait time was pretty long for what was one egg, some bacon and some sauce heated up in a restaurant that wasn't in any way busy. I'll say that it was presented well as you can see in the attached photo.","stars":1.0}

They have HUGE frozen margaritas (\"Monster\" margaritas I believe) which were only $7, but meh, it could have been frozen ice as far as I'm concerned. Wasn't really anything to write home about. The food, ok. We got carnitas tacos - which were dry and I had to add unconscionable amounts of hot sauce to to even enjoy- a chimichunga, which was cool, and chicken wings, which were actually pretty darn good.

The hotel itself, is kind of in the middle of no-where but there is small gas station across the street in case you need amenities, ie. a bottle of wine. There is, however, a small bar (with Happy Hour!) in the lobby as well as free flowing free fruit and 2 computers with free WiFi (that no nobody was using except me). Breakfast is also free (continental stuff) but if you want an omlette it will cost you a little more. The staffs are pleasant and helpful.

We stood in front of the desserts trying to figure out what was best to order. No one ever came to help encourage us on what to decide to get, or explain what any of the desserts were. There was just some new girl at the register that kept saying , \"i can take your order here\". All other staff was just running around like chickens fulfilling drive-through orders. We chose to eat our order in house instead of to-go, and after about 15 min we were finally served (which i thought was kind of unreasonable for desserts you just slice up and put on a plate) . So they bring it to us in to-go containers\/bags. The I look around and pretty much everybody else in the place was eating out of to-go containers. Talk about tacky and wasteful.

{"text":"Just had a great ride\/experience. One of the volunteers took us around the trail. It was more than just walking, which I appreciated. We did the giddy up and ride and, like the other reviewers say, our horses trotted and cantered. It was a little scary at first but the guides and horses are really experienced so I didn't feel too out of control. My horse, Cracker, knew exactly where to go, how to follow, and even knew the cues of the guide so I didn't have to control him too much. It started to drizzle during our ride which turned out to be kind of cool. We also went onto what should have been the side path but due to the recent flooding, turned into a mini \"river\". The horses knew how to navigate and were calm in the water. Only our feet got wet since we were higher up and the water area wasn't Super deep (it came up to the horses bellies. This probably isn't the norm though since this was only the result of the recent rain. ) Overall, It was such a cool experience because we did stuff other than just sitting and letting the horses walk in circles. We did more than I had expected for a beginner ride. Well worth the money (we had a groupon) Oh!! I totally forgot to tip our guide. I know they're volunteers so they probably don't get any money for this. I had such a great experience and she was very friendly and calming, I wish I had remembered to tip her at the end.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Great feel to the newly renovated space. We celebrated out anniversary on a Wednesday night. Reservation process was easy and friendly with a text reminder, which was nice. We were greeted and seated immediately. It took a few extra minutes for anyone to come to our table to take a drink order. Then a few more minutes for the actual waitress to appear. She was very friendly and knowledgeable. However, she was spread a little thin and getting two different drink orders too way too long. When I requested wine with my entree, I was nearly done before I had to flag down the manager to assist. Speaking of the manager, he wasn't friendly and seemed upset\/preoccupied with running the restaurant vs greeting guests. No manager ever came to our table to check in which was very disappointing since we were excited about supporting this new local restaurant. The meatloaf was excellent. The vegetable entree was surprisingly small and overpriced. Biscuits were fantastic. Margarita was too sour. Hummus was too cold and hard...I'm not sure if it's because it was black eye pea based vs chick pea. We understand they've only been opened 5 weeks, so we cut them some slack. The \"now hiring\" banner on the front of the building totally cheapened the experience...very poor first impression for an upscale restaurant. Overall, the ambiance was great, our waitress tried hard and was very sweet, the food was good-ish. We spent $100 for 3 drinks, appetizer and 2 entrees. One of the biggest disappointments was when no one, including the manager standing at the front door, thanked us for coming when we left.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because I enjoyed this so much more than the fancy Brazilian steakhouses. --- --- --- I found this food truck a while back on Yelp and have been stalking their Facebook page pretty thoroughly as I've tried to find a time to visit them that made sense. It ended up working out that I visited them at an office park in Clearwater, near my wife's office, so that she could meet us for lunch. All of that time stalking Facebook was well worth it because I thoroughly enjoyed this meal! I ordered the #1 - steak skewers with rice and beans and I opted to add plantains. My wife ordered the #2, which had chicken skewers instead of steak. I really loved both of these, but thought that the steak was the start of the show. The rice and beans were honestly perfect - everything I'd hope for in this staple of a side dish duo. Plus, each meal was served with some kind of breading that's called farofa, which was an amazing compliment for the meat. Lastly, I ordered a can of Guarana, which is a Brazilian soda that was described as \"like gingerale with cherry,\" which completely sold me. I loved every last drop of it. If I ever see this truck out again, I will definitely stop what I'm doing and head to the counter!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This place is OK at best. The antipasta platter ($16) is decent but pretty skimpy with the more expensive ingredients (meat\/cheese). Pasta dishes are flavorless and none of the entrees stand out. Dessert (tiramisu) was the one really good thing we ate here. For this price, there are so many better places to go just within a few blocks. For example, the amatriciana pasta at La Viola is much better and more flavorful but a lot cheaper. If you're going to splurge on a $25-30 entree, there are many other nice restaurants to choose from. Towards the end of the meal, our waiter began circling our table like a vulture. Right after we signed the check he explicitly asked us if we could leave because another party was coming in, even though we were still finishing our wine. Other groups had lingered much longer than us without being disturbed (but I suspect those groups had not yet signed off on the tip). A couple minutes later, he started pushing our table together with another table (while we were still sitting in it!) to make room for the other group. Again, I wouldn't complain about this service at a restaurant that charges $15 \/ plate but I think it is outrageous to be treated like this after paying $16\/ $25\/ $8 for an appetizer, entree and dessert! The hostess was nice, but just try not to get this imbecile of a waiter with long-ish dark hair and an accent who serves the window tables on Friday nights.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Amazing place! Kava is quite a good trip...kinda like floating on a cloud at peace, with a clear mind and heart. As soon as my girlfriend and I sat down, the \"bartender\" gave us the lowdown on the Kava situation. It is served in one of three varieties (everyday, premium, and rare) which each costs a bit more than the one before it. I had two 'large' servings...(they come in small 4oz, large 8oz and \"party bowl\" - 10 servings with a ladle). There were a lot of people there for a Tuesday night, everyone just chilling and laughing. A really good vibe was in the place. We had a smoothie after the first round of kava (it tastes pretty bad...not \"gag\" bad, but not delicious in any way). Then we each had another round before we left. It's a bit surreal at Bula Kafe. It is like a regular tiki bar you might find on the beach, but no alcohol is served. Just smoothies, teas, and the kava of course. I highly underestimated the power of the kava, which was amazingly relaxing and lasted several hours. It also numbs the mouth slightly when you drink it, an odd sensation, but pleasant. This place is now in the rotation. I will stop here on the way back to Gulfport after any event downtown for a chill break. I am a fan! The prices were WAY reasonable, a large \"everyday\" kava was like 5 bucks or so. Small 3 bucks...I now want to try the \"premium\" stuff... A truly unique experience...I think my girl and I were the oldest folks in the bar (40-ish). But it felt very welcoming...","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Got drawn into this place by a new donor drive that offered a premium for the first 8 donations within a 30-day period. First donation was a bit of a train wreck. They were very busy, so I ended up being there just over three hours without even donating. They infiltrated the vein in my right arm and, because of how long I had been there, decided to just give the whole blood back so I could donate in a couple days. Problem was my phlebotomist forgot to take out the saline, so when the machine attempted to pump that into the vein on my left arm, it caused a rupture and bled. I was patient- mistakes happen- but as a result of the bruising this caused, I was not allowed to donate for 14 days. I talked to Brenda at the Boise office on Eagle to see if my promotional period would be adjusted, and was told it wouldn't. I explained what had happened - that it was a result of a mistake on their end - and was told too bad. Thanks Brenda. In conclusion, you get here what I've come to expect. Impersonal behavior by the staff and constant skepticism, like you're asking for a handout instead of entering into a mutually beneficial agreement. I should mention here, though, that Kevin- one of the phlebotomists - was awesome during my second and third donations and a very personable guy.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Like Dave B, I'm stuck between two and three stars -- after hearing about Philippine Jeepney Grill from a recent article in the news, we were very excited to come here. Sadly, I think what makes this place so attractive is that it's the only Filipino restaurant in the city. We opted for the \"buffet sampler\", which at $5.99 is a great way to try out a variety of dishes. I enjoyed the bicol express, which is a spicy pork and coconut green curry similar to the Thai version. Less impressive was the lechon paksiw, which was somewhat tough and brutally fatty; the sweetness of the dish also overpowered the minute vinegary taste in the meat. The kare kare, which I was looking forward to the most, was a big miss. It would have been incredibly bland had it not been for the serving of shrimp paste on the side, which we both used liberally. Most disappointing was the lumpia. We ordered the savoury kind for the table and for $5 we received eight finger-sized pieces that were very meh. I also ordered the dessert lumpia turon to go, and found it to be okay. I'm not sure if I've been spoiled by my friends' homemade lumpia, but both versions did not live up to our expectations. The redeeming quality about this place is the staff, who were incredibly friendly and kept checking on us to make sure we were enjoying the food. Hopefully on a return visit the food improves considerably.","stars":2.0}

Travis & Jayce showed up when they said they would, and took time to talk to my home warranty company on the phone before doing anything so I could make sure I'd qualify for reimbursement, and then efficiently removed my old water heater, installed a new one with a new drip pan, and added a hot water shutoff so I could turn off just the water heater in the future. They also identified a leak in a pipe I hadn't noticed, and replaced that section of pipe. They worked cleanly, quickly, and with high quality, and were also very friendly throughout, answering my questions and offering advice about water heaters in general, the leaking pipe, and about working with contractors when I have to get all the water damage taken care of. Great experience all around! Hopefully I won't need a new water heater again anytime soon, but I'll keep them in mind for any other plumbing jobs that come up.","stars":5.0}

It was built during the 1960's (from what I was told), and the folks there has still found the ability to keep the atmosphere similiar to the time. Always busy for a little tiny place, but worth it to eat if you are looking for a simple meal for an inexpensive price. Its great! I usually have breakfast there, and NEVER had a complaint about it. They never try to spice anything up, just simple and just right! Parking is usually tough in Roxborough, but you can park behind the citizen's parking lot with free of charge.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"The boyfriend and I headed to Husk on Friday night for date night. We were so excited to score reservations so quickly (got totally lucky and booked the day the online reservation system opened!), and I'm happy to say it lived up to our expectations. The setting was perfect for a relaxed but romantic evening. I really love what they've done with the old house - really opened it up and made it modern but it still retains some historic charm. We arrived about 7:45 for an 8:15 reservation, with the intent of getting a drink at the bar before dinner. The bar area itself was really nice - cozy and with an upscale basement bar feel. Our time at the bar was probably the low point of our visit though and the only disappointment. The bar was busy, but not packed by any means. However it took a full 30 minutes and all the way until our 8:15 reservation to get our two drinks. My cocktail (Rye Rocket) was fantastic though, and my boyfriend loved his Bourbon, even remarking on how much he appreciated the heavy pour. Our server in the bar was definitely in the weeds though, and couldn't handle a full (but again...not overly so) bar, which was disappointing, especially since a managerial type appeared to be nearby just chatting with other staff instead of lending a hand to get the service back on track. When our table was ready, we asked for the check, only to be handed back a folder with someone else's bill and credit card in it! That's just a rookie mistake, and I'd expect better from a restaurant of Husk's caliber, even if it is busy. The only other surprise we got was that the alcohol tax is added AFTER you get your bill, which we just weren't used to. Maybe I've missed it, but I don't know of other places in town that do this. So our cocktail and bourbon (admittedly, he ordered an expensive bourbon) were around $35 after tax. We had a bit of sticker shock, especially considering the bar service quality. However, once we went back upstairs to our table, everything was perfect. Our server was attentive, but not intrusive at all. She took time to explain the menu and cooking style to us so we knew what to expect. She was friendly and totally unpretentious. And the food....oh my god, the food! We ordered the smoked chicken wings and pig ear appetizers, the pork and grouper entrees, and the buttermilk pie and citrus upside down cake for dessert. Everything was incredible, but standouts were definitely the chicken wings (although VERY spicy), pork entr\u00e9e, and buttermilk pie. After tax, but before tip, our dinner total was around $95. Not bad at all for six incredible dishes! Overall, we loved Husk. The quality of food and service is top notch, and we had a great time. We were there for almost 3 hours total, and never felt rushed or crowded the entire time. They still have some kinks to work out","stars":4.0}

{"text":"The stadium is nice. The neighborhood is terrible. It's a relatively small stadium with about 18,000 seats. I'll be interested to see the longevity of the fan-base as the novelty of the stadium and a new team wears off, but so far, they have been doing quite well in attendance and fan enthusiasm at the games is great. The actual venue for watching the event is excellent. Many of the seats have views of the river and most seats seem to provide good views of the field. The stadium also always seems clean and well maintained. The downside to the stadium is that the concourse areas seem too small (specifically too narrow) for the amount of people in the stadium. It's almost as if the designers of the stadium viewed the stadium more as a baseball\/football stadium than a soccer stadium. This is because, unlike baseball, where people head out to bathrooms\/concessions after each half inning, halftime is generally the only time fans leave their seats. This means that at half-time the lines for concessions are very long and the concourse areas are extremely crowded. I'm not sure if there is anything you can do to prevent the mad rush at halftime, but they could have widened the concourse to allow for the mass of people that migrate there during halftime. The parking situation has also deservedly received some negative comments. Like some of the design of the stadium the parking was not well thought out. The location of the stadium is in, literally, one of the worst neighborhoods in Pennsylvania. The riverfront area understanding as a result has plenty of undeveloped area. Unfortunately, the building of the stadium either did not account of the necessary amount of parking nearby or thought they were going to get more people commuting to the games via train. Either way, many lots are offsite and require a shuttle bus ride. Not a huge deal, but certainly not a great situation. Leaving the main parking lot also gets very backed up as there are limited exits. Driving access to the stadium isn't great either. They are currently constructing an off ramp that would allow for reasonable access that doesn't require a trip through the ghetto. Overall its a fun place to visit. I think some of the elements about the stadium and surrounding area were poorly planned, and I'm not a believer that the Chester Waterfront is ever going to be what they want it to be, so I doubt some of the issues about the stadium...specifically parking will ever be addressed. However, the crowds are great and it's a great way to spend an afternoon or evening.

Beatrice was fantastic - friendly, affable, polite, and even offered services without condesending tone (even though my eyebrows need a little work). And all of it was done in about 1\/2 hour. Never more than a few minutes behind and very fast. There's also a relaxing 5 minute massage at the end. All of this for $20 but don't forget the tip. Appointments aren't hard to come by if you put a couple weeks into it (but 3 or 4 days is fine as well). And all of this was 2 years ago and since I've moved again, I keep going back.

{"text":"The Sisters and I have known each other since 1976 when I was a seminarian at St. Anthony's Seminary (now a private school) located behind the Old Mission. I was first introduced to Sister Colette, a Portress Nun at the time, through my friend and fellow seminarian, Paul S. Later, several of us, seminarians, would serve as Altar boys at the afternoon Mass. Every time I visited the monastery, I found such peace. As a seminarian, I had the opportunities to visit with Sister Colette and Rev. Mother M. Clare, the Abbess. My conversations with them were always delightful. They had such inter-joy which seem to pour out of them. During last visit with them was prior to their Golden Jubilee. When I saw both of them, Sister Colette had returned to the cloister, so they were both seated behind the screen in the visitors room. I informed Sister Colette how much of a positive influence she was on my life during my formation years. Jokingly, I told her that several of us, seminarians, were considering calling her Dr. Colette instead of Sister Colette because she had the ability to actively listen and give the advice. Anyway, Sister Colette has pasted away several years ago; yet, Rev, Mother Clare is still alive. So, she is my only connection to the monastery. My intention is to visit with her in June 2012, as we are both getting on in age and our geographical difference, East to West Coast, this may be our very last time we will see each again. Well, I know that in my heart Rev. Mother Clare, Sister Colette (especially them) and the monastery, itself, will always hold a very special place in my heart. So, if you ever have the opportunity to visit the monastery, please do - attending Mass and hearing the Sisters singing is a pure delight!","stars":5.0}

When I entered the restaurant I immediately noticed the bright umbrellas hanging upside-down from the ceiling which gave me the feeling I was in a version of an Indian Alice in Wonderland. The decor was fun and whimsical and it immediately put me in a good mood as we were seated. To drink I started off with the Sweet of Chai of Mine, made with gin, chai, lemon, cream, egg whites and cinnamon. It was only slightly sweet and had a really subtle chai flavor that was not overwhelming. This was my favorite cocktail out of what I tried. My friend got Let's Par-tea which is made with gin, sparkling wine, blue tea and coriander. This was also only slightly sweet but was refreshing. The other drink I tried was the Dehli-licious with rum, lemongrass, mango and ginger ale. It was very sweet but I did really enjoy the mango flavor. My friend and I shared all the food we ordered. The waitress suggested we get a couple items from the left side of the menu then one thing from the right side of the menu which are the heavier items more like entrees. We took her advice on that and also ordered a dessert. The first thing we tried was Puff Puff Pass which are four semolina puffs which had a filling of daal (Indian lentils), potatoes & a yogurt sauce. The server told us that you were meant to consume each puff as a bite otherwise it'd be messy. There were so many flavors\/textures hitting my mouth that I thought this was so interesting and delicious. I liked the crunch of the puff and then the soft texture of the potato and lentils. The yogurt cut through all the flavors and was refreshing. Next, we tried Shammi the Way which was my favorite thing of the evening. These are two lamb sliders, which have mint chutney (yum) and pickled onions on them. The meat was so tender and the flavors were great. The O.G. was our main entree, which you can get with either paneer (Indian cheese) or a roasted half chicken. We got it with the chicken which was roasted well and the sauce was definitely the star of the show. It came with a side of yellow rice but we also were instructed that one of rolls\/breads would be good with the sauce. We ordered The Right Stuff which is a flatbread called a paratha. It was flaky, soft, and lightly fried but not oily. It almost reminded me of a Mexican sopapilla without the sugar on top. We could have easily finished the meal there. However, we were having such a great time so naturally dessert ended up being part of our night. Our server informed us of the options and we settled on a chocolate mousse not on the menu. It was served with three chocolate mousse with a sliced strawberry, candied ginger, sesame biscuits, pistachios and pomegranate seeds. The mousse was","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Tria is awesome. Everyone who lives in Philly and enjoys food should come here at least once, as Tria offers something for everyone. First, the food is consistently amazing. The truffled egg toast is one of the best apps I've ever had, and all of the bruschettas I tried (broccoli rabe, pistachio ricotta with honey, and truffled mushroom) came on thinly sliced bread with a light crispness that served as perfect backdrops for the delicious food on top. The sliced Italian meats were solid as well. For my (only) main course, the smoked duck salad was the best salad I've ever had in my life. While I am nowhere close to salad lover status, I've tried countless salad dishes and this one comes out on top. The dessert was incredible as well if not perfect, as the bread pudding was very sweet and the chocolate espresso cake was on the rich side, though I guess that is the point of dessert. The wine selection here is also incredible. The staff was somewhat knowledgeable (though a bit rehearsed), but it's hard to go wrong with their broad selection of reds and whites. I sampled the torrentes, riesling and the valpolicella classico and was happy with each, though I must say it was misleading for a 'glass' of wine to come 1\/3 full. The service was very friendly if on the slow side, but it was understandable given the busy night at the full restaurant.","stars":4.0}

My mussels marinara we good but not over the top good. Could have had more sauc end garlic bread. Still, this place on a Sunday is awesome, practically no wait for excellent, not over priced food.

I recently moved to Northern Liberties and found myself often walking up and down 2nd Street to find a new \"local\" spot to call my own. Being a music fan, I was immediately drawn to the sweet sounds of a nylon stringed, jazz guitar from the street. I poked my head in with my girlfriend and saw an incredible layout of a rustic, DYI looking bar with a live jazz band. We headed in for a drink and needless to say, we've been back many times. The service is always on point and the beer selection is great! I will admit, their Old Fashioned was pretty weak, so I would avoid any cocktails but the bartenders are very friendly! The wait staff is also great the few times I've eaten there! The food is a tad on the pricey side, especially for that neighborhood but well worth it for a date spot!","stars":4.0}

In addition, still haven't received a refund on that double charge yet, or a follow up call from upper management apologizing. We were also told that we would receive a call to schedule delivery, and what I received was an email that showed a time that wouldn't work for us.

They were willing to give us a slightly better price if we paid cash, so we went for it. We paid $5,001.40 for the trailer. They weren't willing to shave the $1.40 because the water bottle they offered my husband at the beginning \"wasn't free\". They didn't mention he needed to pay for it, they just offered it to him so he accepted it. $1.40 isn't going to put us out, but he wouldn't have taken it if he knew they were going to make him pay for it. He had a drink in the truck and would have been perfectly fine walking out to get it. It wasn't a horrible experience overall, but we won't be returning customers.

Even the homemade chocolate chip cookie was soft, moist and mouth-watering delicious! I must say even the gender neutral restrooms were clean too! Someone was always there constantly cleaning around the shop so that was impressive!

For those of senior years, please be careful stepping down when going into the interior room to the right of the front door.

{"text":"Freud wrote in \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" about \"the narcissism of small differences,\" and this concept is the essence of what the current phenomenon of hipsterism is about. Of course the recursiveness of hipsterism is that hipsters love to hate other hipsters and claim some difference between themselves and the other hipsters. As such, Exo trips a whole lot of my hipster\/hipster-hater triggers. The pomo exposed-brick-and-industrial-steel-and-rustic-woods interior design; the fetishization of the equipment; the turntable playing vintage vinyl alternating with ipod or powerbook itunage plugged into vintage amplifier. It's all just so... perfect... And worst of all, the extremely small space combined with the now extreme popularity. All this makes me think, \"I love this, and I hate this, and I hate all you people taking all the seats and making me embarrassed to be one of you.\" However, if you can get past, or never suffer from, this kind of vicious spiral of neuroticism and self-hatred, and if you can get here early enough to find a place to sit, or stand nervously against a wall, and if you like good coffee and espresso, then you should visit Exo. The simple facts are this: they know how to roast coffee really well; They know how to prepare and serve coffee really well; they make cortados (literally \"shortened\" in Spanish, a wonderful style of espresso drink I haven't seen previously outside of Argentina and Chile. basically a really small, elegantly performed latte); they are nice people; and finally, the place is very comfortable to hang out in - but again, only if you can find a spot to sit down. If you can't find a spot (approximately every other time I come in, I cannot), at least buy some of their beans, and some unbleached filter cones, and take it all home to make some pour-over cafe con leche yourself, and hang out in your living room with your dog and your plants.

The Duck Fat Fries with Sly Fox Cheddar was delicious too- the cheddar wasn't too cheesy, which I liked. I also got the Ginger Ale Beer- which is nonalcoholic. I thought it would be ginger ale + beer (both things that I love) but it was just ginger ale + more sugar. Not really my taste, and a warning to those who think simply like me.

Not to mention a nice waiting room with delicious tea. If you can make it during the day on Mon -Wed, the price is even better, like $30 for a Swedish and $40 for a deep tissue. I like to get their signature massage, which is a combination of Swedish, deep tissue and sports. It works wonder in getting the kinks out.

They cook the chicken in small batches so it does take a little while to receive your order, not to worry, it's worth it. In addition, a couple of the side dishes were real standouts. The green beans are slow cooked and come in a large dish with a side of white rice and brown gravy. Wow, that's how I want my green beans from now on. The red beans and rice was great too.

{"text":"I bought a brand new truck at the end of last year over 40K. I barely put 2k miles on it and the engine goes. Now I am being told that there was a known issue on all Ford trucks that were built from April-October 2016 with the engine's ecoboost. This requires a total engine replacement. I only put less than 2k miles since I bought it and due to an known issue with the ecoboost engine now they need to replace the engine on a 40k+ truck that is still brand new. When I took it in I was advised the issue causes the engine to lose oil and my engine had none. Ford says they like to honor their warranty so they will replace the engine on a truck I will be paying over $600 for 7 years. Who knows what other image has happened that I will not find out for years to come. I do not understand why they would sell a product like that and lastly why do they not stick behind their product and understand that 40k+++ is a lot of money for people and they should get what you paid for not a repaired truck that I only had a couple of months with 2k miles. I should of stayed with the Chevy Silverado.","stars":1.0}

Alas, it was not reheated long enough, the roll was still a bit stale and the spinach remained cold at the time of consumption. Returning to the soccer complex around the corner to enjoy my sandwich and my boy's soccer game, let's just say the soccer game was the only thing that was not a disappointment.

{"text":"If I could rate this company zero, I would. This company is a bunch of scam artists. I honestly question all the positive reviews. Before I got this insurance I called around many places to make sure that my pet's history wasn't going to be a factor in his future coverages. My cat had UTI before but I know that some companies will still cover this in the future if he has been UTI free for over 6 months as UTI could be a recurring illness (bacterial infection). Petsbest was very nice when I called and said that most likely it will be covered but it depends on the underwriter. Two years after I joined my cat had a urinary blockage due to a stone. This is not UTI as I've asked my Vet. She replied that there is no bacterial infection (per my cat's urine culture). Stones are formed by diet and such. My claim was completely denied. They told me that my pet's condition happened before he joined pets best. He has never had a stone in his life prior to this. To put things into consideration they said that I was claiming for heart murmur which was on the bill but made up .06% of the bill. When he was as kitten there was some heart murmur but the vet ruled it out that later and there was none. Before he had his surgery for the stone, the vet did a check to make sure his heart was fine (which it was). That was part of the whole bill yet the whole claim was denied because of the heart murmur. I'm sorry if this is very rushed and unclear as my pet recently passed and I can't think straight. But my advice to others...please beware of the company. I've been a customer for my whole pet's life (minus the first 6 months as a kitten) and the one time I put in a claim they find every reason to deny it. I called to ask why my claim was denied and the woman who went from very sweet voice to very nasty voice really quick. When I didn't pursue further she went back to her sweet voice. This company has FAKE written all over it. I will appeal and hopefully they will manage to do the right thing and cover the expense.","stars":1.0}

Very inviting for long enjoyable conversations. We sat at the bar and ordered the calamari and grilled octopus. The calamari were ok. Not bad but not special either. The grilled octopus was good. Not extraordinary but perfect fine. For dessert we had tiramisu. This was sinful. Thank goodness loosing wait it's not our New Years resolution because it would have been out of the window. Note to self: happy hour every day and dishes are half off. Something to take into consideration is that the pasta dishes are from La Strada, which is next footy, and offers extraordinary mushroom tortellini.

{"text":"A relative and I went to lunch here today (a Friday) and were seated immediately. Chips and bowls of salsa were placed on the table and I was happy to have my own salsa bowl, making it so I didn't have to be mindful of not double dipping. No mention was made of a lunch menu as restaurants often do when eating at that time of day but we found the lunch specials on the last page. Our order was taken within a few minutes and then served around ten minutes later. We both ordered lunch specials and were surprised by the large portions for the entrees being lunch entrees. I ordered a lunch special #8 which is a burrito and a tamale with a choice of rice or beans. I chose ground beef for the burrito and went with beans. Both were pretty good but nothing exceptional. The tamale on the other hand, was made up of way entirely too much masa and too little meat filling. I would not recommend their tamales. Service here was very attentive and the lunch special prices are incredibly reasonable, especially when factoring in the portion sizes. I would definitely go here again but not order tamales, which is kinda disappointing.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"The Omni is a nice hotel in a fabulous location. The Mister and I were in town for a conference, and decided to tack on a few days of Nashville fun. Rather than deal with the valet at the Omni, we parked at a garage a block up on the other side of the Music Center for $24 a day. Not great, but better than Seattle, Boston or Chicago. We arrived early, and lucked out in that our room was clean already and were able to check in and freshen up. The room was spacious and the bathroom sink had enough counter space for the 2 of us. The dresser drawers were huge with plenty of room to put our clothes in. The closet was small but wasn't out of the norm of most hotel closets and as a bonus there were complimentary bathrobes. There was a fridge which was nice to keep drinks in (Walgreens up a few blocks on 5th street). What is great about this location is it is about 2 blocks from Broadway, there is an awesome Mexican restaurant down the hallway to the Country Music Hall of Fame (also attached), and a couple restaurants open after the Hall of Fame closes. Since the Mister wanted to get some work done, he sent me to the Omni spa 2 mornings. The changing room was awesome with private changing rooms, a sauna, private showers and a nice counter area. I did not like the fact that the relaxation room was co-ed. I'm not a fan of men with their bits next to my bits just separated by robes. I just couldn't quite relax. I wish they would separate the room in half with a women's side coming out of their locker area and the men's side coming out of their side. There are 2 doorways going back to the treatment areas so I think this would be feasible. Despite this, the treatments I received were top-notch, and the complimentary champagne post-treatment were a plus! Its hard to evaluate the sound-proofing of rooms in hotels because you could have a quiet neighbor which masks potential issues. In the hallway, however, there were some noise issues. One night there were people coming back in the early morning hours laughing, being loud and slamming their doors. Outside, well, our room was on the side of Korean Veterans Blvd. There are construction projects going on across the street. Luckily, the mornings we slept in were a holiday weekend. But the weekday mornings we had to get to the conference we had to get up early and the work started at 6am. We were up anyway, but jack-hammering that early could be annoying if you didn't have to get up early. Ask for a room away from that street if you want to sleep in. There was also a train nearby and would blare its horn at all hours of the night. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs. Overall, I would absolutely stay at the Omni Nashville again.

{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I wanted to give this place 1 star, but I feel as though I need to give 2 stars for the way that the manager handled our very odd dining experience. She did genuinely seem to care about our experience, but it was all too far gone at that point. Of the group I was with, we all regularly eat out at nice restaurants, and one of us is affiliated with a popular, upscale restaurant in another city. Plus, we really wanted to love this place since we had friends who ate here 2 weeks before (also in the hospitality industry with very discerning standards) who said it was great. The meal started promisingly enough. We ordered cocktails and then put in a number of starters and an entree to split between the table. The server asked if that was all of the food that we wanted, and we asked if what we ordered was enough for the table for dinner or if we should order more (perfect opportunity to up sell). The server said no, so we didn't add anything to the order. The first grouping of appetizers that came out were good and included the brussels sprouts, which turned out to be our favorite food or the evening. I love brussels sprouts, but when that's the best item, something is wrong. This round of appetizers included all of the veges we ordered, so we knew the meat would be coming after. When we were done with the first round, our smaller share plates were cleared away and we were given larger share plates in anticipation of the meat. This is where it got weird. No more food comes out for what seemed to be 45 minutes, and the server seemed to be avoiding our table? Like she seemed to be going out of her way to avoid us. Did she want to avoid questions about where our food was? Was she angry at us for not ordering enough food? Remember that we asked her if we needed to order more for the table and she said no. We assumed she was pissed at us for some odd reason, which we cannot fathom. We had to flag her down to order another cocktail and ask about the status of the rest of the food, which she said would be out in just a minute. Finally, the rest of the food comes and is brought out by the manager, who was apologetic and unprompted said that dessert was on the house because it took so long to get the rest of our food. How was the rest of the food? Not good. Not only was it not good, but most of it was cold, so it had obviously been sitting for a while before it was brought to us. A few very sad items in this grouping: the risotto, which was ice cold; the spaetzel, say over salted; and last but not least, the pork belly, which was supposed to be \"crispy\" but there was","stars":2.0}

Service was excellent, food was good and authentic.The second time the service was really slow and we had to ask the servers what we needed many times. This is a usual problem is many Asian restaurants. Servers don't have a common sense. If there is little kids at the table, they are supposed to bring water in cup with straw and lid. But instead they just bring big glass of water full of ice with no straw. How can a 3 year old drink from that glass? Anyways, service was poor at the second visit. And the food items (ALL OF THEM) were super super spicy even though we asked them mild. I don't think I will return here unless I really crave spicy Korean food.

The present people are from the China mainland (not Hong Kong), so the food no longer has that South China\/Cantonese flair, and is more like the standard Mandarin Chinese restaurants. The menu and preparation are pretty much standard, with the common red-and-black menu, and back-lit pictures above the cashier counter. I had my standard Moo Goo Gai Pan, and noticed the freshness of the vegetables, and just the right amount of seasoning, no excess salt, chicken was good, the egg roll was great, and the pork-fried-rice was superb, with lean and succulent pork chunks, not the usual dried out pieces that normally come in pork-fried-rice. Noticeable differences from standard Chinese walk-up-and-order restaurants are the self-serve soda fountain (Pepsi products), disposable chopsticks available alongside the self-serve plastic utensils, larger than average dining area, and a rack of kids' toys and puzzles, placed out near the magazine rack, so they were probably as much for customers' children as the owners' children.

{"text":"One of the worst customer service and food, I walked in expecting to pick my order that I placed online through their website. There was no wait staff at the front, I kept waiting expecting someone from the kitchen to come and help me out, some old dude came out and I told him am here to pickup my order, he did not understand me and went back in. After several minutes of waiting I called their main number, no one picked up the phone so I called the other locations asking for the owner or manager, I had no luck at the Manayunk location but was able to get through the manager from the East Falls location. I told her that it has almost been here for half an hour and no one has acknowledged me, as I was talking to her one of the customers told me that they had been waiting for an hour and no seemed to bother to serve them. After a while a dude walked in from the outside in a hurry, apparently he had been out on deliveries. His name was max and he was a one man show, taking orders, making deliveries, waiting on the customers and serving the customers. I also learned that my online order had not been prepared ahead of time, it was prepared when I walked in. The owner Sajid has no clue whatsoever of running a business. I regretted not going to my usual favorite place in town, Ekta Cuisine. I would stay away from this shitty place.","stars":1.0}

We were there to celebrate my bosses birthday, total of 8 of us, just trying to have a nice evening away from work. He immediately complained that he was going to have to put tables together and that we were late. Our administrative assistant had called to make the reservation and alert them we would be tardy; we were informed it wasn't going to be a busy time so whenever we arrived would be fine, but apparently that wasn't the case. He consistently made undermining comments, ignored certain members of the table and made everyone uncomfortable and upset.

{"text":"I think I am becoming obsessed with gyros - is that a bad thing? In the land of the Philly Cheesesteak, I find myself craving a good gyro sliced right off the cone. So I was excited when I saw this restaurant in downtown Glassboro just off Rowan University campus. I am not sure what rock I have been living under, but this joint has evidently been around for a couple years. I was greeted by an older - what I think was - Greek gentleman and was staring at two beautiful lamb cones on spits right behind the counter. I thought to myself that I would be in for a treat. I was a little troubled when I saw the sliced meat transferred from the cone to the flat top, but my fears were unfounded. I found the service to be emotionless and slow - I can't say rude, but just not friendly. I waited about 15 minutes for my order with just 1 person ahead of me. However, all that was forgotten when I got my actual gyro. Warm pita, generous portions of tender meat, fresh tomato, and crunchy onion. I also appreciated that they put the Z sauce on as a condiment, not drowning the gyro like some places do. I also ordered a side of Aegean sauce to see what that was about. It is a mixture of mayo and mustard, but I recommend sticking with the Z sauce. The sandwich comes with a small bag of fresh fried and seasoned chips. Think Greek should make you think Greek the next time you are in Glassboro.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"The on again, off again, on again, off again, on again franchise known as Ponderosa Steakhouse has never really abandoned its presence in the Hoosier state even during its leanest time. Started in the mid-1960's by local auto dealer Norm Wiese (along with Dan Lasater and Charles Kleptz), Ponderosa Steakhouse would rather quickly also include the Bonanza chain and would have a very modest presence in the 80s and 90s before starting to bounce back in the late 90s. It's still not a huge chain, but now operated by Homestyle Dining LLC, Ponderosa Steakhouse still has a pretty decent Hoosier presence including this Southside location. Every time I drive by this place, it seems to be crowded. It is a steakhouse so, rather obviously, it offers modestly priced steaks (most are in the $10 - 15 range). It also offers pasta, fish, chicken and, of course, a buffet. Ponderosa is housed in a free-standing building at the corner of Emerson and Thompson in the same parking lot as one of the city's two remaining Kmart stores. It's an obviously older building. They have a couple of non-ADA compliant accessible spots along with a curb cut that, oddly enough, is located across from the spots rather than next to them. I'm guessing that there's either been renovation or someone was dropping acid when they designed it. As you enter the first set of doors, there's a second set of doors - one is for entering and going up to an ordering counter. The other is where you exit. The ordering counter has their meal menus along with their buffet, though it's not very clearly explained. I don't know that I actually saw the buffet price tonight, but the person working the counter was helpful enough that it worked. You pay, get your receipt and then you can pick out a table in their large dining room. You leave the receipt on the table and a server will bring you your drink while you go get your food. This all seems weird considering right now on the Ponderosa website it brags that they were rated #1 in customer service for steak\/buffet restaurants (Is that really even a thing?) by Restaurant News Magazine (Which, oddly enough, really is a thing). They brag about their \"full-service,\" yet you have to go get your own food. How is that full service? I mean, sure, they bring you your drink. Big whoop? My server, and I use that term lightly, was Mona and she was definitely friendly and quite obsessive about clearing plates (and admitted it). I also got serenaded by a lovely young child who was belting out \"Tomorrow\" from the musical \"Annie.\" I didn't pay extra for it. The food on the buffet consisted largely of chicken variations (tenders, fried chicken, baked chicken, bbq chicken, etc.), ham, noodles, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and a few other mostly \"homestyle\" type options. They also offer desserts, including sugar free options, and rolls. To respect my diet, I mostly stuck with chicken options along with mashed potatoes, carrots, and a","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Balcony Bar. Where it fits for me is a weeknight or weekend afternoon. The Balcony Bar is a really cool old house. A really big old house. It is very interesting inside, but I always go for that balcony to observe the happenings on Magazine. The food is very passable, although knowing when your food is ready is sort of a pain. It is just bar food, but above average bar food. The pizzas are pretty good and they have a large assortment of fried foods. It does get packed on Friday and Saturday nights. The crowd then definitely skews college aged. I'm not much of one for crowds and also don't care for constant reminders of how far removed from college I am. Especially when those reminders are wearing neon YOLO shirts. I've heard bad things about the bartenders, but haven't had any issues myself. They aren't exactly rays of sunshine, but they aren't scumbags either. A few months ago they popped up a big white Ten Commandments style list of dress code and rules.

{"text":"Drink LOTS of water! There was so much salt on the food it was hard to taste much else- and the fact that they melted AMERICAN CHEESE on everything didn't help. For an appetizer we had the Queso Fondito. A skillet with melted American cheese and some sausage. I asked the waitress about the Pollo Azteca. I asked her what kind of cheese was in the sauce. After leaning over my shoulder to read the menu, she told me that they only use American cheese. Awesome. American cheese at a Mexican restaurant. I had the #15 combo- chicken quesadilla, beef taco, beef tostada. My chicken quesadilla was greasy and filled with chicken and American cheese. My crispy taco had salad on top- lettuce, cabbage, and carrots. Carrots on a taco? It was also topped with American cheese. The tostada was a flat crispy taco with beef and... you guessed it- American cheese. My lips tingled for the rest of the night due to the excessive salt in take. The table side guacamole was a neat idea. Until I saw the girl put an entire tablespoon of salt into the what, two serving bowl? I ordered a Miami Vice to drink. It's supposed to be a strawberry daiquiri and Pina Colada mix. It tasted like ice. There was no flavor. On the good side, my kids enjoyed their Kraft macaroni and cheese- although the waitress initially brought out cheese quesadillas (that we did not order- which she then asked if we wanted to take home and charged us for). We were going to order dessert, but after we were finished the waitress took 15 minutes to come back with our check... so we stopped at the local ice cream shop afterward instead. I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone. The service, food, and drinks were all terrible. Except for the Kraft macaroni and cheese.","stars":1.0}

The burger chef nailed the food - she is a rockstar! Inside, it's small and super clean. Really clean.

NOTE TO MGMT: Buy some BBQ sauce for your restaurant. Nobody in our party liked their food. Seems like a fun place, especially to sit outside. But when the food and drinks are not good (bordering on horrible) why go back.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"A disappointment. I come to Coal Pizza as a foodie with a love for all things pizza. Every style has its appeal. Give me good pizza and a micro brew and I'm in heaven. If you come to Coal Pizza expecting premium pizza of any variety, something with premium meats, a knowledgeable serving staff, and amazing flavors in every bite. You're going to be severely disappointed. As our waitress arrived at our table to take our drink order I inquired about a particular beer on tap I've never had before. This threw her for a momentary loop until she remember to pull out her notepad and read off something to the effect of 'A light refreshing beer!'. To which I screwed up my face and asked \"yeah?'. 'Would you like one?'... 'Hmmm' . Then I got up and walked to the bar so the owner could pull me a sample. He was very pleasant and obviously cared about beer. The beer in question was lemony swill, tasting like someone went fruity on a Budweiser. I settled on a tasty amber. Note to those explaining beer everywhere, use terms like body, malt, hops, talk about its smell, it's genre, etc... These small breweries in Indy haven't opened because people settle for a 'light refreshing beer'. We ordered the Greek salad, a prosciutto pizza, and a pizza that was half 'cheese' and half tomato and cheese. The salad was dandy, though the greek salad was suspiciously like a caesar, matter of fact throw some croutons on it and it could have passed for one. One of our party members inquired as to if the pepperoni was of the spicy or mild variety, they offered to grab us a piece. We were all obviously excited for a preview of our delicious 90 second pizzas... they brought out a piece of pep that could have walked out a plastic bag in the refrigerator section of Marsh. This was a preview of things to come. The half cheese half tomato & cheese pizza came out first... someone gave the illusion of cheese dancing on this pizza, I'm not sure who's idea of cheese this was. It was more like a light dusting. Meh. The 'Prosciutto' pizza came out next, it was lovely. A hearty layer of cheese with some sliced honeydew mellon on top drizzled with balsamic. There was obviously a bit of prosciutto there, thing was... it was totally tasteless. The honeydew mellon and balsamic completely dominated everything about the pizza. This was junk prosciutto, it didn't come from a local charcuterie, this was on the same level as the crap pepperoni we tasted earlier. It was... interesting. I understand what they were going for, but their ingredients were simply not up to the task. ON A PIZZA CALLED 'PROSCIUTTO' YOU'D THINK YOU COULD PICK OUT THE KEY INGREDIENT! These pizzas were a victim of poor ingredient choice and lacking any sort of sparkle in the flavor department. A shame. For $16 for a 12\" pizza I was expecting something excellent. I should also mention how","stars":2.0}

I'm usually so laid back and not picky but I just couldn't eat it. So I decide to order another one with the premium cream and as I was ordering the owner lady asked what was wrong with my first one. I was very nice but honest she asked if she could try to make it better and then she found out the employee forgot a ingredient. I tried it and still was sick. Got my other one made which I paid full price for and it was creamer looking but hard as a rock and didn't taste creamy or like ice cream. My husbands was so so.

I gave Amani my theme and one piece that had to be in my sleeve and let him create the rest. When the time come for my first appointment I didn't know what to expect and ended up sitting for 18hrs, you may think that's a long time but honestly Amani started working and piecing things together and we would look at it and he would have another idea and change a little here and there until we both decided it was perfect. The time I spent in the chair went by so fast between Netflix, guest popping in every once in awhile, videos on the computer and just having life talks about how we both raise our kids, current events, politics, our travels and anything and everything else.

{"text":"Some friends and I were going to a late movie and decided to grab dinner first. I had never been to BJ's and suggested it. Its pretty much a standard franchise brew house. Fairly certain beer is not brewed on site, but I could be wrong about that. It's a Ruby Tuesday's with a slightly better beer selection. I had their light lager, comparable to a bud light. Not my favorite kind of beer, but its more wallet friendly than a nice bold craft. I ordered the buffalo bison burger with a wedge salad, dressing on the side. I like my veg. No questions, no problem. Easy order. Or so I thought. Tell me yelp-verse, what does \"on the side\" mean to you? Maybe I'm wrong, but generally it means in a ramekin on the side of the plate. When my salad came it was drenched in dressing. Some dressing, whatevs, I don't care. But I couldn't see any leafy greens, so I sent it back, politely explained that I asked for dressing on the side. When my salad came back there was even more dressing on the salad. now completely surrounding the plate. I realized.. they thought I meant dressing on the side of the plate. Oh. My friend who is a huge fan of blue cheese dressing decided to take the salad and move it to his bill. So no harm, but I do feel like this is waitressing 101. The waitress added on to this by rolling her eyes when she placed the second salad in front of me. One other complaint, our food took over an hour to receive. We got there well ahead of our movie time (1.5 hours), they weren't busy and still had to throw food down our throats and rush to the theater. The food was fairly tasty, hence the 2 stars. everyone enjoyed their meal. The buffalo bison burger was pretty good, though it had to be enjoyed on the fly.","stars":2.0}

The menu was diverse with interesting options. I was not feeling adventurous and stuck with Pad Thai, which was very good. I ordered medium and it was quite mild. However, my experience has been that the better Thai restaurants don't make \"hot\" overwhelming and that seems to vary, so I wanted to get an idea of their spice level before choosing hot. It was quite flavorful. I also got the Tom Yum soup and it was probably one of the better Tom Yum soups that I have had. Although, I did not have wine, they have a good wine selection and the interior has a very pleasing \"new\" appearance.

{"text":"Negotiating with verizon for internet\/cable TV services is similar to negotiating with a used car salesman. However, buying a used car is much simpler. You are only negotiating one price. Throw in Verizon's deliberately obtuse price structure and you have an impossible situation. After a series of 5 phone calls and a lot of wasted time, I'll be taking my business elsewhere. I called Verizon to renegotiate our cable bill after it had become too expensive. I asked what the options were, from continuing our current package of TV\/internet\/phone service to internet only service. Each price I was quoted was well above what is being offered to new customers. This business model is backwards. Verizon is effectively telling its established customers that you matter less than new customers, which is insulting. I was told that Verizon can't give me those prices. The word they're looking for is not can't, it's won't. The solution: one price for everyone. No negotiating. After receiving the price quotes, I decided to call Comcast to inquire about their prices. I then called Verizon back to accept their internet only offer, which was well above Comcast's prices. Mainly, I didn't want to switch services. However, Verizon then quoted me a price $20 a month above the price I had called to accept. Frustrated, I called back and received a third different price, $40 above the original price! My decision was made. The incredible thing is that if I was given the price I was originally quoted, I would still be a Verizon customer. So you say, good luck with Comcast, they are exactly the same? Your bill will jump in price after the introductory offer? True. That's why the cable TV industry is doomed. More and more people are realizing they don't have to pay ridiculous prices for services they don't need. It's much easier to stream content you actually want a la carte. And there's one price. No calling to renegotiate your bill when it becomes too high. No opaque pricing structure. Verizon Fios will be a fossil in 20 years.","stars":1.0}

Well I didn't smell or see any chicken at all cooking on the grill, in fact it was empty! I was watching the workers and all they were doing was standing around talking to each other. I noticed the grill master guy was standing next to the microwave. What was he doing? I was curious so I kept watching him only to realize he was putting the chicken in the microwave and nuking it! And who knows how many days old that chicken was. I couldn't even eat my lunch because I was disgusted with what I had witnessed. I didn't want to take a risk at getting food poisoning!

The lamb was on the seasonal menu and its my partner's favorite. The meat was requested for medium cook (5\/10 cook) but it was served well medium cook (7\/10 cook). So she requested for a replacement, in just 5 minutes, the meal was served. It was not even medium raw (3\/10 cook). I certainly think that it was a challenge from the kitchen chef. My partner did not want to have any trouble so she just take it how it is. But I feel unpleased that how can the chef do this things in the matter he was asked to cook the food medium cook but instead he did over cooking it. Then I'm not sure what happened they placed with a raw food. I took a picture as you can see. I have been to LongHorn couple times but this is the worst experience I ever had and nevertheless it somehow ruin our night as it was our 7 monthsary celebration. I'm really disappointed with this experience I hope it will turn out to have a significant change on the management and chef whereby I'm not sure if he\/she is capable to cook. Or this will be the last time I will be coming in.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I cajole everyone I know into going here, because so many people think vegan eating is joyless. At Horizons, it is an art and a celebration of life and peace and flavor and creativity. One example -- we ordered the Jamaican Jerk Seitan for an appetizer. My partner took his first bite and looked at me incredulously with joy on his face, knowing it would blow my mind with flavor, and it did. I am crazy for mushrooms, and the dish that featured them prepared four different ways was heavenly. It even had a tiny shepherd's pie with mushrooms on the bottom. He had the Cauliflower Mac, which mimics the comfort of macaroni and cheese without hardening your arteries. When your partner is vegan too, you can obviously just switch plates the whole time, wherever you go -- but at Horizons, make sure you get your fork into every dish you can. :-) It is always so hard to decide what to order here. We need a sampler! We really enjoyed tasting the wines by the glass, many organic, and our waiter made excellent recommendations. The staff is very well-trained and enthusiastic about the food. It makes me fantasize about working in a vegan eatery. As a coffee fanatic (and Coffee Fool addict), I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the loose teas. The blueberry rooibos tasted so good that I am now have a proper teapot of my own. We have the Horizons cookbook and have made nearly all of the dishes. It is filled with good advice and cool stories of how Kate and Rich get their food ideas. I love that there is a vegan restaurant so good that people have to make reservations far in advance. Maybe someday people will go out for vegan like they do for sushi. I cannot believe people complain about the prices. They are right in line with other nice restaurants and probably lower, with all entrees under $20. Long live Horizons! Bravo Kate and Rich!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Mallory is the best tattoo artist I've ever worked with and I regretfully wish I had all my ink done by her. I love her studio because it is so private, quiet, and comfortable, totally different than going into a tattoo shop off the street. She has a light touch and knows how to use color. Really super talented and also so much fun to talk to--which is really important when you are sitting alone with someone for 4.5 hours! I have no negative things to say except for maybe that she is booked out far in advance so you may have to wait a while, but I suppose that's not really a negative because when getting a tattoo you want someone who is in high demand. It's a good indicator of the quality of her work. I should have come to her sooner, she's the best around!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Mom's Deli is a staple of South St. Louis dining. The speciality sandwiches are uniquely selected and made to order. In addition to these house gems (i.e., the Mom's, Dad's, Charlie, and Po' Boy), the menu is online and posted in the store for your own mix and match creations. Sandwiches can be ordered hot or cold, with a variety of toppings. Mom's also carries a large selection of drinks (bottles, cans, and fountain), snacks (chips of all kinds), and dessert (including lots of local treats like Ted Drewes and Dad's cookies). For casual dining or picking up sub sandwiches on the go, Mom's is one of the best local choices! To maximize efficiency, call your order in before arriving. By doing this, you can skip the sandwich counter and go straight for the cash register - which will save you a lot of time on beautiful summer evenings or during the lunch rush. The street parking can also be a bit tricky. For those less comfortable with parallel parking on a busy street, try turning down the first side street. Parking is usually more available and less stressful, even if you do have to walk a few more steps.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I've eaten at Kyoto for years despite only okay quality of some of their food (their salmon sashimi is delicious and fresh, but their tempura flakes are always soggy and their beef tataki is frequently overcooked), but after my last meal there, I won't be going back. More than half of my last bowl of salmon don here was covered in so much pickled ginger juice that it was inedible (something that the hostess insisted was impossible, but my rice was visibly dyed yellow in parts by the ginger), and my side-order of maki contained strands of someone else's hair. My boyfriend's rice bowl was great for the first half of the meal, but partway through, he bit into a piece of sashimi that had literally been left out for so long at the restaurant that it was dry and crunchy around the edges. Our order had been to-go, and when we called to let the restaurant know that someone was dropping the ball in their kitchen, the hostess demanded that we pack up the remnants of our meal (some of which was literally in the trash can) and drive it back to the restaurant so that they could \"have a look at it.\" If you're hungry for sushi on Jasper, try I Love Sushi instead - it has a silly name, but the food is excellent. Or, if you want a top-notch Japanese meal in Edmonton, go to Maki Maki or Furusato (both on Whyte), where the food is always prepared fresh and served with a smile. Kyoto restaurants are ubiquitous here in Edmonton, but so many other restaurants do it better!","stars":1.0}

The custard melts as fast as custard should (still not sure if there is some secret formula for how fast ice cream or custard should dissolve). But it is good. Wizards is never crowded. It is perfect for families. Service is fast. Two can eat for $5. So basically, you keep taking your out of town guests to Drewes.

{"text":"The Fox Theater is my favorite historic building in Tucson. The renovation turn out so well. I had a chance to tour the theater while it was still being renovated and it was a huge project. Before the renovation there wasn't much left to work with. There was a large dirt pile roped off right in the center of the theater. The renovation tour just went around it. I once met a person who told me he and his friend would break into the abandon theater and drink, it was a long time ago. I am so glad we have people in the community who had the vision to bring this theater back to life. I have a soft spot for classic old \"movie palaces\" and The Fox Theater in Tucson is my favorite. The Art Deco design is impressive. If you visit and have orchestra seats you must take a side trip up to the balcony and look around. There is a lounge off to the south side of the balcony with a nice display detailing the renovation. This is also a great place to get an eye level look at the fabulous Fox Theater sign. Just take a quick look out the window. I have been to a few performances and a few classic movies at The Fox. The schedule seems to me to be geared more to the calmer, more mature, crowd. I always sit in the lower level. For movies I like to get pretty close to the front. The movie screen at The Fox isn't very large. I once bought a Fox Theater gift certificate to give as a wedding gift. It was nice to be able to support the theater while getting something for the-people-who-have-everything. As a celebration of the very first Tucson Downtown Second Saturday The Fox featured The Portland Cello Project, a group that plays everything from Heavy Metal music to Britney Spears on the Cello. I had never heard of the group before seeing them at The Fox, but I have since gone to a couple of their concerts. I have to thank The Fox for the introduction. The Fox offers a great little snack bar. They offer a nice wine list and a full bar. They serve popcorn. Turn to the left upon entering the theater to get to the closest snack bar and restroom. Last week I had the pleasure of seeing David Sedaris. I didn't have any problems hearing any of his readings. Each word was crystal clear. I also had a great view of the stage. I sat in row 'S' seat 14. I would request this seat again, it was wonderful. I will be back to The Fox; it is a beautiful theater.","stars":5.0}

She not only was the only bartender, she was the only stock boy climbing in and out of a hole in the floor, bringing up all the beer and whatever else they got low on all night, she was the only janitor too, sweeping, then mopping all the floors AND cleaning the toilets and bathrooms! She did this while the lazy manager sat there drinking with his buddies and calling it \"training\". After all of that - 13 and a half hours!! - HE TOOK ALL OF HER TIPS !!!

The interior is split up into two rooms, with the room to the right being more intimate. The parking is on the left side of the restaurant (if you're looking at it from the front), but as this establishment is right on Kennedy Blvd., parking can be somewhat limited. The staff is helpful and accommodating. It can get busy so make sure to make a reservation ahead of time if you don't like waiting or have time restrictions. The restaurant offers daily specials which can be found on the black board next to the hostess podium. I enjoy the Japanese style food and sushi at Sushi Ninja as well as the Korean food that I've had. I like that they give you Korean accompaniments before your meal. The kimchi and others (unknown to me) are quite tasty. I've had a few excellent seafood\/fish dishes. Once there was a whole snapper special on the menu and it was shared amongst the table and devoured by all. My friend raves about the bibimbap and almost always orders it when here.

{"text":"I really like giving good reviews, but only when they are earned. I was hoping to find a good, low-cost barber shop in Reno but I didn't find one here. In all fairness, there are probably half-a-dozen stylists who work here and perhaps I ended up with the only one who wasn't able to give a decent haircut. I came away with the impression that they simply lease chairs\/stations to stylists since I paid the stylist directly and she made change from her equipment drawer, so maybe you'll have a better experience if fate delivers you to someone else. Well, onto the haircut encounter. I picked this business based on the other glowing Yelp reviews. The promise of a good, $12 haircut was an added bonus. As soon as the haircut began, however, I had the sinking feeling that I was in the land of the not-quite-right. The stylist seemed to be in a real hurry - rushing to comb my hair, dragging the power cord to the clippers across my chest, soaking my head with her water sprayer, and so on. Keep in mind, my hair style is a typical uncomplicated guy's hair style... no bald areas, parted on the side, just wanting her to even things out - trim above the ears, tapered in the back, etc. To accomplish this, the stylist grabbed the hair and began snipping rapidly in an almost manic way that I have never experienced in 50 years of haircuts. When she was done, my hair was so wet from her frequent spraying with water that it was hard to tell how bad the results really were. I left there hoping for the best but inwardly dreading how it would look when I got home and had a chance to wash the goo out of the hair and comb it myself. My wife (of 30 years) and I both agreed that it was the worst haircut I had ever received... shaggy, uneven, and too short in the wrong places. It's going to be a painful few weeks while I wait for the hair to grow out and can then sheepishly visit my regular barber and mumble something to him about being the victim of a drive-by-shearing.","stars":1.0}

Then you go down a long hallway with colorful stars and posters.

Then the second room has a dodge ball bounce house, gauntlet type maze bounce house and two giant slides with mats for super fast sliding. The most entertaining part is the projection arcade game on the floor! It's nice and cool inside and clean. It didn't smell like feet and was wide open for plenty of room to run wild!!

Also, as it's been said before, the swing seats are the best. I recommend making a reservation for them just to guarantee that you get them. Being able to swing away at dinner is such a fun experience. As for the food, I loved it. I thought the menu had a plethora of selections, my boyfriend and I struggled to pick what we wanted. They encourage you to share and order multiple things so we did. We ordered the Barbecue Chicken Quesadillas, French Onion Soup Dumplings, Ahi Tuna Tartare, and the Korean Pork Tacos. Everything was fantastic but the Korean Pork Tacos were my absolutely favorite. I highly recommend them, they were full of flavor and I couldn't eat them fast enough. To finish, we decided to get two desserts. The Banana Foster Cream Puffs and Deep Dish Cookie. The desserts were freaking amazing. I'm not a big sweets person normally and I loved them. I'm definitely planning to return to Continental in the future! I loved my experience here.","stars":5.0}

She allowed a minimum number of people in the salon to cut down on infection rates, required everyone to wear a mask, and santized everything. I felt very safe. I brought in a couple of inspiration pics to show Jen what I was looking for. She took the time to discuss with me various details of the style and gave me suggestions for how to maintain it on my own. The cut is amazing - exactly what I asked for. And she even took extra time to blow dry beach waves into my hair, which is not easy given how fine my hair is. I felt well taken care of and am extremely satisfied with my new look. I will definitely use Jen again in the future!","stars":5.0}

I'm use to having a po boy with some type of creole condiment and we were curious if the Resturant had any.

This is light, delicious and I could eat the whole cake, not just a slice. It is to die for. Kaya is traditionally a coconut flavoured spread for bread.

Barely edible sandwiches, burritos & cold drinks. At least it's there folks. What the hell is it with the top notch prices??? ($7.63 for a cheap burger, etc). They should can the ambient industrial music blasting too loud at night. Bike stand out front. Carry a hammer & Lysol can with you if you go in the after \"Midnight\" hours.

I went in with two friends around 10am and we were all excited to see bagels and lox on the menu and proceeded to order that. Slight problem- they just sold the last of the salmon. It was only 10am so we were a bit surprised by that. (This was made worse when the woman next to us had the last order of bagels and lox and it looked delicious!) We instead opted for breakfast sandwiches on bagels- a very limited selection of bagels to choose from though. (Again, 10am.) There was only one woman working so it took some time for our meals to come out and when they did, the eggs were cold and we were served the wrong size iced coffee.

It's already difficult enough to open a small restaurant - I can't imagine how trying it must have been to do so during a pandemic. But you would have never known of any high stress levels from the people I interacted with in here - they were so incredibly nice and lovely. And the world needs nice and lovely more than ever right now. My first two attempts to call in a pickup order were met with a recording that said the number does not have a voicemail setup. It didn't even ring, so I assumed the number posted online wasn't correct and just got in the car to place my order in person. But I called one more time on my drive over and it rang + someone picked up. I guess that means they just don't have call waiting? So don't get discouraged if that happens to you - call back in a few minutes! But because my call was placed when I was already en route, I arrived before everything was ready. While sitting and waiting for my food, two different people came to check on me to make sure I didn't mind waiting. The second lady brought me a cup of ice water. There was just a vibe of generosity and sweetness here that went above and beyond normal cordial behavior. Again, maybe it was more palpable because we're living in tense times as I write this. But either way, they left an impression on me. As for the food, we ordered a few things: -Viet Kitchen Noodle Special: 4-stars. I enjoyed this, but would have liked it more if the noodles had been warmed up a bit. Maybe colder noodles are typical on this type of dish, but I was just kind of surprised by that. The meat and egg roll bits were great! -Pork Fried Rice: 4.5 stars. The wife added a little bit of soy sauce, which made it even better. The pork was perfect. I preferred this to my dish. -Viet Chicken Wings: 5-stars. The best thing we ordered. I would happily order an entree version of this with rice if it were available. The crispy exterior is what dreams are made of. -Pina Colada Boba Slush: 4.5 stars. I've had a lot of boba in my life, but never pina colada. I loved it. Their drink menu is a bit more unique than most - I'd love to work my way through the menu over time because there are a lot of options that look great. -Vietnamese Iced Coffee: 5-stars.

Reading these other reviews, I'd say if you're not on board with vaccinating your children then don't go to Ada Pediatrics. It's as simple as that and doesn't warrant a 1 star review to them because your preferences don't match their life commitment to modern medicine. Dr. Ryan is always available via email if you have any questions about your kids. With our first, I was full of questions as most parents are and he was always so kind in his responses. I honestly prefer to reach out to him then call in and catch whoever is available (can be a hit or miss). I did have to call in once after hours about a concern and the doctor on call (neither Ryan or Bob) was a bit rude and condescending but I've never had to come across him again. Their staff for the most part is very friendly, I love their nurses. They are a bit archaic with technology but have just started automated confirmation via text or phone call with appointments. Their office doesn't look like it has been updated for 20-30 years, which honestly doesn't bother me. I am more concerned about my children's care then how beautiful and modern their building is. I'd say they're doctors for all the right reasons and that's why we take our children there.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"This was absolutely, hands down, the worst experience I have ever had at a \"fast food\" place! I would give it 0 stars if I could. Today, I placed a curbside order at 5:53 for 2 dozen breadsticks and sauce. It was supposed to be ready in 18 minutes, which was fine because that's how long the drive way anyways. When I got there, it was so inundated with drive thru, that I had to wait in the drive thru line just to be able to pull into the restaurant. After that, all of the curbside spots were taken, so I parked in a spot and tried calling to see if I could just have them either come to my car and deliver it, even though it's not at a curbside spot or if I could come in an just pick it up. I waited on the phone for over 5 minutes just for no one to pick up. I then go inside to see a line of people waiting for their food as well. I spoke with the front of house to see if my order was ready and was not given the time of day. They even asked me to repeat my order as if they just couldn't go back and check on the screens, which I know they can, as I have worked in fast food my entire adolescence. They ended up telling me that they were waiting for my call, which I clearly tried, but was not even answered, so why would I call again? That's why I ended up going inside to tell them my order and even told them I ordered through curbside. In the end, I waited 52 minutes from start to finish just for 2 dozen breadsticks and sauce....that's it! On top of all that, all they gave me in exchange for the ludicrous amount of time I waited was 2, $5 off coupons that I can't even use together, rather than a free meal at least!","stars":1.0}

The coffees are generally excellent, but the last time I visited, in December 2009, it seemed the beans had been underroasted or perhaps stored too long. The Mexico Altura, which I bought whole-bean for a drip machine and a Chemex glass coffeemaker, was stale and bland. The beans had none of the essential oil that even a medium roast needs for full taste. I was also disappointed in the Montecito Blend, normally a great coffee from Santa Barbara Roasting Co. But I base my generally positive review on my previous experiences, where both the in-house servings and the take-home beans were spectacular, bold and full of taste. I also just love the place. It's comfortable and always available and just a nice place to relax in the beautiful town where I grew up. I just hope they pay a bit more attention to their roasting and to the freshness of their beans. Peets is in town and it serves up a generally great brew, so this place can't rest on its laurels.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying I only walked into this place on accident! I got a flat tire on central avenue today. As I was sitting here waiting for my wife to come change my tire I saw a bunch of people walking in there. I decided to follow them. I actually thought it might be a mirage for a second. The women were GORGEOUS, the beers were ICE COLD. And they had my favorite song playing on the juke box. It was like it was meant to be. I sat down and was greeted immediately. I ordered a Budweiser, and man was it the best bud I've ever had. Tasted like I was back home in Georgia on my four wheeler in my American flag bathing suit. Just as I thought this place couldn't get any better I ordered a burger. Have you ever had a taste of sweet baby Jesus? Well I have. Thats exactly what it tasted like. I ordered it med-rare because I don't have any teeth and man was it so tender. I hardly even had to chew it. The only complaint I would have is that the burger was so cheesy, the cheese was getting stuck to my gums. But you guessed it. I ordered another Budweiser and I was good to go! Best finger lickin, gums slappin, smack my ass and call me spanky burger Ive ever had! Ill definitely be back!!!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"OMG! So much food!! Went to this location since my brother swears by Brazilian Steakhouses and I found a Groupon. The location is not in the best of places as its on Armenia by the bowling alley however, once inside that all changes. The decor is very elegant, bottles of wine mixed with TV that display beautiful pictures of Brazil. From the buffet I grabbed a bit of paella, au gratin potatoes, and cucumbers. The paella was delicious and so were the cucumbers. We were also brought fried yuca and this amazing cheese bread. I really wish the fried yuca was hotter, they weren't cold, I'm just used to eating them hot since my family and I make these. So much better when hot since they're still really crispy. We also had a white wine sangria. Delicious. Just enough wine and fruit and it was absolutely refreshing. I drank most of this as I wasn't driving, ha! Anyway, on to the food... They basically hand you a round sort of token, green means go, meats come out and red means stop. My server suggested we keep it on green and we can always say no of anything comes out. I can't name everything but my favorites were the sausage, the ham, and chicken. No joke, they brought out at least 12 different meats to try, likely more. It just kept coming!! I tried and my husband would finish the pieces. It was just too much! I'm not a big meat eater though. My favorite thing was the dessert. Passion fruit mousse. OMG! I LOVE ANYTHING PASSION FRUIT! So good! Andddddd, they gave me some to take home because it was close to my husband and I's anniversary. The service was the beat I've ever had. They were amazing.

The only negative comment I could make was that the staff was \"pleasantly rude.\" By that I mean, they were obviously annoyed handling so many people and even snapped at the bride (all with a smile, believe it or not).

{"text":"The other day after my dentist appointment (no cavities, yay!) down the road a bit, I found myself in need of a smoothie. Yelp pointed me in the direction of Good Karma Cafe, located in the same lovely house as one of my favorite yoga studios in the city. I've been meaning to get out to this spot for over a year now, having heard only great things about it. Besides, you have to support the very far and few between vegan eateries in this city. My problem is that I rarely eat lunch out and Good Karma doesn't serve dinner (I wish they'd start!) so that's my excuse for it taking me forever and a day to finally try it out. Let's just say that one glance at the menu and the food coming out of the kitchen has me vowing to come back and grab food to go as soon as possible. And my Tropical Delight smoothie? Pure nirvana! I'm glad that the banana didn't overpower the other fruit, as it often does, and it was perfectly sweet (lately I've been ordering smoothies that leave a lot to be desired. I don't need them sugary sweet, but I don't want them to taste like unripened fruit either). I also grabbed a Girls Gone Vegan lemon bar for later. So cool that they have tempting vegan baked goods here. To give you an idea of the space- I used to practice yoga in this room years ago and found it to be really inviting, good vibes throughout. Now they've added a variety of typical tables, but also a long low table and banquet and the ceiling is festooned with Moroccan lanterns. It's really nice! Again, I just wish they'd do dinner a couple times a week so I could practice upstairs and then get a healthy, tasty dinner after my class. A girl can dream. It has taken me far too long to get to Good Karma, but now that I have, I will make it a point to go back whenever I'm in Mid City and in need of a hearty vegan lunch, smoothie or Girls Gone Vegan baked good.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"This is one of the best parks I've visited in central Indiana, and if you look at my Yelp review history, you'll see I've visited a lot of parks! This lady knows her parks, mmmkay? Hummel Park in Plainfield is impressive for many reasons: it's huge (205 acres!), it has multiple playgrounds (like 4!), it has a splash pad, it has a baseball field and basketball courts, it has a great area to creek stomp with lots of shallow places for kids to wade, it has paved walking trails, it has a bridge, it has a amphitheater, it has clean restrooms, and a lot more that I'm forgetting. Also, it's really clean and well-taken-care-of. People with kids definitely need to visit this park. Like I said, there are four different playgrounds, so you could spend a lot of time here going from playground to another. The biggest playground area is located in the southeast part of the park. This playground includes a vintage twirly slide, but also a more modern playground structure with multiple slides, tunnels, bridges, monkey bars, poles to slide down and rope ladders to climb up. The playground is accessible to kids of all abilities, and includes a ramp entrance into the playground structure. This part of the park also has swings, including a saucer swing, as well as a separate playground for toddlers, and a big sand box. The splash pad is located in this area of the park, too. It's a great size for toddlers. I wouldn't visit this park just for the splash pad, because there are other parks in the area with bigger splash pads, but it's nice that there's one here and that it's so close to the playground. There is another playground near the performing arts center, which includes a toddler playground and a playground for bigger kids. A short walk away from this playground is a nature playground, with manufactured boulders and rope webs that kids can climb and explore. Paved trails offer an easy walk or stroll. As you meander through the park, you'll probably cross over a bridge that's suspended over White Lick Creek, which runs through the middle of this park, and it flows from the north part of the park to the south part. There are five small lakes within Hummel Park, including Blue Heron Lake. Hummel Park is also a great place to go creek stomping, because the creek bed includes many shallow areas where kids can wade in the water. I've heard that the sledding hill at Hummel Park is amazing, so I'll have to visit in the winter with my kids.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner and a drink before a movie. Makayla took us to our table and was also our waitress. So friendly, upbeat and efficient, she was a super-star server. We were lucky enough to arrive during happy hour and it certainly made us happy! Started with a fabulous Village Collins made with huckleberry vodka. Refreshing and delicious, the perfect drink on a hot summer night. Our app was a chicken quesadilla with guacamole. Nice sized with good chicken and guac and a nice amount of sour cream. My only gripe was the tortilla was not crisp and not easy to cut. Also had the Short Film burger with cheddar and fries. Skin on shoestring fries accompanied a yummy, well seasoned, juicy burger that was properly cooked. Unfortunately a star falls from my rating when my dessert order did not arrive promptly and had to be cancelled so I could get to my movie. Overall, I really enjoyed the food, drinks and especially Makayla's exceptional service. I shall return!","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Aaahhhhhh the elusive cheesesteak!!! It certainly is in Florida!! You have everyone claiming \"genuine\" just to see roasted peppers on your sandwich, or it simply tastes like ... grade f meat. I'm looking your way Delcos. I arrived at this place famished after having moved my entire home for the past seven days..... alone. Because it was late, I didn't really expect much from any place.... so I yelped this place as it was the closest to my new home. I went inside and no one was there, and the gentleman behind the counter quickly asked me what I wanted. Undecided between a quick kill of fried food or something salty, I asked him about a cheesesteak. We chatted and I told him I'm from the state where we are all spoiled by amazing food. You know what state that is if you're from the area.... hint it's on the East Coast and everyone makes fun of it. Anyway... he immediately said he makes a good cheesesteak. \"Oh do you?\" said I... \"because no one in Florida knows how to make a good cheesesteak.\" \"I do\" he answered confidently. I told him to make it the usual way. He asked if I wanted lettuce and tomato. I answered with \"wash your mouth out\"! A few minutes later, I was given a generous looking sandwich cut in half with french fries. Upon inspection, I noticed the three important parts of a good cheesesteak: FRESH Green peppers onions and mushrooms, which were saut\u00e9ed perfectly. Secondly I noticed that it wasn't covered with yellow oil goo. It had actual cheese melted on it. And thirdly, the bread was absolutely perfect. This was that genuine, simply made, kind of cheesesteak we are all looking for when we come from up north..... fresh vegetables saut\u00e9ed perfectly with a bunch of beef and cheese melted on them! This is what makes a soft, moist cheesesteak... on an awesome roll!!!. Not roasted peppers! Because you're too cheap to keep fresh peppers in your store or canned mushrooms..... because.... same!! A very nice surprise indeed! They're open till 10 PM or even 11! Give them a try!!!","stars":4.0}

Figured I'd give it a shot, not knowing i would soon be eating the best sandwich I've had in a long time. Meats, bread, and cheese are all extremely fresh and tasty. They only sell one size sandwich, but that one size will easily feed two people. Service was friendly - we sat at the outdoor tables and they brought our food out and let us eat before paying. I love places that trust you to pay after eating. Only downside is that there is no indoor seating, but I wouldn't let that stop me from going back. If you're looking for a place to grab a sandwich or pizza on 309 that isn't a chain I would highly recommend Goomba's!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I've shopped at Once Upon A Child before in another state and store. I was actually a regular at that particular site. And while I recognize each site is unique, there should be a standard that's consistent. I am giving the Wesley Chapel store 1 star. I rarely if ever write negative reviews and feel that it's harmful. But because this is a consignment business I feel honesty is best. I took 2 bags jam packed full of name brand boys 10-12 clothes. Much of it was new or only worn once. Name brands like a&f kids, abercrombie kids, gap kids, under armour. And all in good to excellent condition. That's why I chose to consign (or try to) rather than donate. Because my kid grew so quickly he didn't get to wear much of the clothing. One pair of Osh Kosh jeans were worn once and I know I paid at least $20 for them! I'll admit there may have been a few items I accidentally put in there while sorting and figured they wouldn't be accepted. That's understandable. So I go into the store and the young high school\/college kid was rude. All staff there that day behaved like their job was keeping them from other better things they could be doing. While the gal looked through my clothes, I looked at the merch. Shoes had stains and dirt left on them, and the bigger sizes were few and far between and over priced. So I went to wait in my car since I didn't spot anything I needed. Came back in, rude again. The other gal working pulled a bin out, slammed it on the counter and offered me $18 for my clothes. I laughed and declined explaining the items were worth much more. Also knowing they'd sell those clothes for way way more than they were offering me! The young lady explained prices are all set and she has nothing to do with it. I let her know I totally understood, that it wasn't personal, and asked for my things back. She wadded up my clothes in a ball, ripped the sack I brought, and shoved the bags at me. She then turned around and began working on something else. No offer to help me since she ripped my bags and no apology for doing so. I don't have to concern myself with OUAC again as my baby is now wearing adult sizes. But my hopes is to help you avoid getting ripped off. Perhaps there are nicer cuter items for babies, thus the 1 star for benefit of the doubt for that. But as far as doing business with them, I wouldn't. Avoid avoid avoid.","stars":1.0}

This place is super busy, but after sitting there waiting for awhile, and what normally should be an hour max, for breakfast, took almost two. You will definitely wait 20min for a table, and while the servers are attentive and friendly, you will wait another 35-40 minutes for your food once you place the order. While watching, I noticed not allot of food coming out of the kitchen..seems really slow. I think half the battle and reason why it's so busy, is because the kitchen can't keep up. Also, you can spend about $8 on three chocolate chip pancakes and get nothing else with it, I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous! So I ended up getting eggs Benny with salmon. It was OK. Honestly, I enjoyed the same thing allot better at Daily Eats, who are just as busy, half the size, but allot faster. This place makes breakfast feel like a project, our whole experience with this place took almost two hours.

Hopefully, we won't need to be back but if I do have body damage again, I will take my car to Spectrum.","stars":5.0}

Oh yes they also lost their liquor license. We just got the check and they charged us for a dish we never got. Something changed at this Resturant.

{"text":"I had a mixed experience here. I booked an appointment, and the day before I was to come in I got a call from one of the employees asking about what sort of dress I wanted. I had some pretty specific ideas, and I was really impressed by how much she wanted to help me find the dress I was seeking (no bling, trumpet cut, maybe some lace, no flowers, no bows). I even sent her some pics of dresses I liked via email. She told me that she'd pick out dresses that were similar. But when I got there, I was disappointed. The dresses that had been picked out for me were really not similar to the ones I'd talked about over the phone and sent pictures of. I looked around the shop and found that there really wasn't anything I was interested in, and the sales ladies started to get rather pushy, telling me that they could radically alter one of the dresses they'd shown me to match the style I was looking for and that I should put down a deposit fast before someone else snatched it up. Why would I want to pay for a dress that is very different from what I'd like in hopes that hacking it up and sewing it back together will make it into something acceptable? In the end, I felt like they'd wasted a lot of my time -- since we talked on the phone and I sent photos, they should have easily been able to tell me that they just didn't have the sort of dress I wanted at that time. I was very clear about what I wanted but still spent about 2 hours at an appointment trying to explain why I didn't want this, that, and the other dress...that shouldn't have been necessary, since I was so clear and specific about what I was seeking. For discount dresses, I think Sabrina Ann (in Ardmore) or RK Bridal (NYC) or Bridal Garden (NYC) are much better choices.","stars":2.0}

The store occupies a huge building (formerly Tres Amigos) holding over 80 dealers (many of them from Copper Country). The store is open & airy with a neat industrial look. The dealers (each running their individual spaces) stock everything from shabby chic, to industrial steam punk, military, kitchen, furniture, jewelry and you name it. Staff was very helpful and friendly. And unlike Copper...this place is air conditioned! Third weekend of the month is 10% off everything in the store and they will have monthly sidewalk sales where anyone can set up in the back parking lot. In addition, various dealers run their own sales (viewed on a board at the entrance). They are located just west of Pep Boys and there is lots of parking but if necessary...Pep Boys will allow overflow parking in their back lot.

{"text":"Not a bad hotel at all. We stayed six days in Philadelphia. The courtyard is centralized to almost everything. Walking distance to LOVE Park, City Hall and various restaurants and shops. The bigger Marriott is just next door and has more features. Our room was spacious. We lived in the 5th over looking the parking lot and Macy's Department Store. Two queen size beds, a large tv, a hidden refrigerator, a desk and many lamps. The bathroom was an interesting configuration: sink outside the \"water closet\" area where the tub and toilet lived. So mornings were quite loud when I had to wash my hands while friend slept. The fitness centre was well lit and had many options. They are located on the second floor (above the Mezzanine) where the conference rooms are located. If you use the main elevators, you'll need to walk around to enter the fitness centre. TIP: Use the back elevators to save you from walking into a conference frenzy. However, I was disappointed to learn that this hotel doesn't have a pool anymore. What?!? I know. They got rid of the pool a few years ago. If only guest at the Courtyard, could share some facilities at the bigger Marriott. Only in an ideal world. Also, the hotel doesn't have a tourist service where you get information of tours and recommendation. Drag! Overall, this hotel was perfect for our trip. Central and convenient.","stars":4.0}

We felt immediately at ease when we walked in, and did not feel the \"pressure\" that you normally get when walking into the bigger furniture stores in town (you know who I'm talking about). This is a family owned business, and you can feel that from the moment you start talking to one of their sales staff. Not only was our experience in store exceptional, but the couch we bought is high quality and was not over-priced. Chris worked with us to get us as many discounts as he could. After we walked out, we got home and realized the full sectional would not fit (Eek!) so we called him back and he worked a solution with us to return one piece (you can add and subtract pieces as needed) and take an additional console instead. Worked perfectly and fits so great in our living room! Thank you again, Chris and Jen. We'll be back when we need a new mattress for our daughter!! - Heather and Steve C.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"The Coffee Collaborative is a pretty great place. I have been a patron since they opened last summer and have watched its evolution from an empty room into an awesome place to get your coffee\/tea fix. In addition to several killer blends of coffee which kick the butt of anything else found in the UCSB Campus\/IV locale, they take the time and effort to make cold-pressed coffee, which beats any traditional iced coffee hands-down because it is incredibly flavorful and bright without being watered down by melted ice! If you are looking for something blended, try a Vanilla or Caramel Blended Crushed Coffee - they blend coffee beans right into it. Nothing here is oversweetened (unless you want it to be). I haven't tried the teas but people seem to like them. It's a peaceful place to relax and study, with tables as well as a long lounge along the rear wall. Every time I have been in, the place has been comfortably packed with folks. The music is always something different, and once there was even a duo playing fiddles in the lobby! The only downsides are: the fact that the restaurant next door always plays obnoxiously loud music, which is difficult to escape if you want to sit outside on the Collab's patio; also, they are a bit lacking in the snack department (only bagels, some granola\/Clif bar type things, and fresh yogurt parfaits which I have not yet tried), but...

I cannot fathom how it takes so long to fry up some wings and shake them in sauce. They must have the worlds smallest commercial fryer. Speaking of sauce! If you dont order them extra wet, you get no sauce on your wings especially the boneless. I just ordered today and this takes the cake. I ordered 3 blue cheese sauces and she made sure to clearly state they are $0.60 cents each! I said ok just give me 3. So I get my food after 25 minutes of waiting. She quickly goes through the boxes and in one of them there were only 4 of the 8 wings I ordered. She goes back and within 2 minutes I have 4 wings. I wish it was that quick for the initial order!!! The wings had hardly any sauce as I forgot to order them extra wet so I asked for a side of sauce which I got quickly. I get back to the office and realize they only gave me 2 blue cheese and we didnt go through the bag. On top of it all there is some \"Takeout Quality\" check list that they never fill out and is a waste of paper and maybe we would get what we ordered correctly if they did fill this out and the orders were checked by the people fulfilling them. The food is EXPENSIVE even on Thursday and the prices keep going up!!!","stars":1.0}
{"text":"My insurance changed at the first of the year and I no longer have chiropractic coverage so I was looking for the best bang for my buck without compromising my care. I decided to check this place out as the introductory offer was $19. I don't remember the doctor I saw, but he was nice, if a little excitable. The office smelled clean, and everyone was pleasant. My normal chiropractor charges $40 for each appointment if you pay cash vs. using your insurance. This place charges $30. If you opt to become a member you have a couple of options that make it so that chiropractic work is affordable for you; just check out their website! The best part of all of this, though, is there hours! They're open late, and they're open on weekends. My neck issues tend to pop up on the weekends, or when my normal chiropractor can't fit me in. While I absolutely LOVE my normal chiro, it's just getting more difficult to get in and with The Joint Corp's hours, my husband can get in to see someone without having to schedule the time off of work.

They kept making terrible excuses as to what was taking so long. After all that time they would not tell me what the interest rate being offered was even though I said I wanted to shop around for loans. The salesman made me go talk to the finance manager who would not come out and tell me the rate. Finally they said 15.5%!!! Also they added fees onto the already agreed out the door price; which he quickly said he would fixed when I noticed them at the bottom. I said I would not sign it and he was extremely rude. That being said, I walked away, went to GCS credit union ( a great local place!) and came in the next day with a check to the dealership.

None the less, my I was quite impressed with my last visit here this past Saturday. I came in here to get a quick smoothie and take a few minutes to relax. I ordered a Strawberry banana smoothie SOY. Thereafter, I proceeded to take a seat and wait for my order, received it, took a few sips and was enjoying my time. A few minutes later the cashier came around realizing it wasn't made soy, offered to remake it and as well was nice enough to offer me a coupon for another drink on the house at a later visit. I thought this was great service given that they realized it was made incorrectly and had the audacity to acknowledge me and make me aware of their mistake. I feel most places would realize they made a mistake and write it off as if it never occurred. Fantastic service, great drinks! Thank you very much.","stars":5.0}

Went in there because it was owned by some of the people on \"its always sunny...\" Though in the heart of the most historic areas in the city, the bars tries to paint its self as a dive bar, however because everything is new and pristine it tends to look a bit more trendy than divey. I had a cheese steak and i can say it was right on par with any cheese steak you can get in the city, won't blow your mind but if ur in the mood its a safe bet... I have also had the cheesesteak eggrolls which i would not recommend. First because they are $12 for 6 smaller pieces and they are more corn dog and egg roll The beers were a bit pricey at $7 especially for a place that has a subtle hint of paddy's pub, however they do have specials during happy hour that make it pretty cheap Overall i would say this is an avg bar which can be easily overlooked if it were not owned by some Philadelphia celebs.

Don't go to the girl with the red hair if you want a cut. I had to go to Empire Beauty school in Cedarbrook Plaza to get them to fix it!

The outside tables were spaced apart very well which made us more comfortable. We perused the menu and made our choices. My wife decided to get the The Skillet and I chose the patty melt.

Good news: About 2 inches of soup and all of the seafood survived, and it was absolutely fantastic. I love tom yum goong so much, and I have yet to find a good version (or honestly any version) near me. As a weekend treat, I went back online searching for absolutely any I could order. I found a different restaurant on Postmates, ordered the soup, the order was canceled after two hours of waiting. Found Yum Yum Asian Fusion, ordered their tom yum, again the order for delivery was canceled (no drivers). Finally, having sunk 3 hours into it so far, I ordered takeout through their website and went and picked it up. Returning victorious, my bag immediately broke and dumped the soup all over the floor. My carpet is stained and my spirit is somewhat broken, but the remaining soup was fantastic. The shrimp and scallops were perfectly cooked (not chewy at all), the broth was extra spicy as I requested and nicely acidic, and the vegetables were all soft and sweet. I will definitely order from here again and this time bring a rabbits foot or something.","stars":5.0}

We started with an appetizer plate with some shrimp, lamb lollipops and a few other little trinkets. Everything was amazing, especially the shrimp which I am always super critical of because so many places overcook it. Next was salads. I got the salmon crab imperial cake over arugula, wifey got beet and feta salad. Superb, two little fried cakes that absolutely delicious. For the main course my wife got surf and turf and I got filet mignon, which granted isn't exactly a Greek specialty but I'm a sucker for steak. There was a very nice seasoning on the steak that pushed it towards the Mediterranean flavor profile. My wife's dish was killer, I wish I would have ordered that instead. Lamb kabobs on a bed of lentils and lamb sausage, and shrimp in a spicy tomato sauce with feta on top. And to top it off, a tremendous sampling of sticky sweet Greek desserts. The waiter was extremely nice and made sure everything was perfect. The owner was wandering around also making sure everyone was happy. Be sure to make reservations though, it's a small place. Several parties couldn't be seated because the dining room was full. All in all a great experience, can't wait to go back!","stars":4.0}

The atmosphere is not surprising - pretty much exactly what you'd expect from a Starr restaurant; it's kinda kitschy, kinda exciting, and more sensory overload than not. The music was typical as well, like upscale elevator music (with one Fleetwood Mac track thrown in the mix!) The service was fine, nothing to write home about. My boss and I both ordered The Green Submarine, and it was pretty disappointing. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good. But the sandwich had so much unrealized potential. They skimped on the avocado, the sun-dried tomato was a very light paste (the menu just said \"sun-dried tomato\"), as was the cheese. There was one or two good bites of flavor in the sandwich, and the rest was just dry. The cucumbers weren't very juicy or ripe either. The bread was delicious. I chose the fruit option as my side dish with the meal, and that was pretty tiny but fresh tasting. At least the lunch menu is priced pretty reasonably for a center city establishment. I was even a little surprised at the affordability.","stars":2.0}

I had a strawberry vanilla and a mocha flavored one... honestly they tasted similar. I was slightly disappointed by that, but overall the donut will blow your mind.

Reading and collecting books is pretty much my only hobby. So I'm pretty much happy in any place that has or sells books, and for the most part Books a Million is a happy place for me. Yeah their selection is decent, and if they don't have it they'll order and have it delivered to you. It's spacious and clean, and while The bathrooms aren't exactly immaculate, they're passable. There's a small cafe where you can purchase coffees, smoothies, and basic pastries along with limited seating. Their magazine selection is actually fantastic, and they have a pretty decent bargain priced selection as well. They also have a limited selection of LPs and various book themed gift items. Sounds pretty good so far right!!?? It does. That is until you need help with something. Good luck finding someone, and if you do, good luck with them having the time or care in actually helping. That is until you go to pay for your purchases. This right here is where this location, has lost this customer, who spends a shit ton on books, forever. I won't be back. Ever. First I bought some books, and upon checking out the guy asked me if I was interested in the rewards program. I told him politely, no thanks I've heard the run down before. Not interested please just ring me out. He then went on to explain how awesome the program is, how much it can save me, yadda yadda yadda, and it'll ONLY cost you 25 bux to do so. Now I'm a firm believer that spending money to save money is stupid ( that's just me) and in kinder words told him so, and again asked him to PLEASE just ring me out. He continued to push the program. Now I've worked retail my entire life, and I get that that is his job. I also get they probably have a quota of how many new members they have to sign on. But I also believe that after twice asking him to seriously please just ring me out, he should have done so. He didn't. He also went on to insult me, and make me feel like an idiot for not wanting to spend an extra 25$ on my already hefty purchase. Long story short, he extended a 3 minute transaction into a nearly 10 minute one, insulted a customer, and I still didn't buy their damn plan. Fast forward to a week later when a special edition book I've been waiting for is finally released. I happen to already be in the mall so I say screw it and try them again. I grab the book I wanted, plus 7 more, which would have brought my purchases to a bit over 300$. I go to pay. There's a woman in front of me already in the process of paying, and guess what?

The workers checking tickets should check the chair sizes prior to letting people in to avoid this issue and assure everyone has a great view of the performance.

I've been coming here since 2000 and not too much has changed - you can always expect a wait, but typically it isn't too bad if you come alone and request a seat at the bar. And, it's worth noting that the bar is THE place to sit - not only does your bar stool perch offer a prime viewing opportunity of oyster-shucking, but you get to talk with the good folks behind the bar. They've stories a-plenty between them if you're up for some real talk, local-style! As you'll read in just about every review, you MUST try (err, inhale) the chargrilled oysters. They're topped decadently with cheese and served in a bed of garlic butter sauce and kissed with just the right amount of smokiness. French bread is at the ready to sop up the juices of this adventure in culinary hedonism that you may just want to ride again... so, do yourself a favor and order the full dozen from the get-go! I've also had the shrimp po-boy, which is truly overstuffed with loads of golden shrimp, seasoned to perfection and served with Tabasco mayo (optional, but I say this is mandatory). Two hours of oysters, terrific bloody marys and an Abita Purple Haze will leave you pondering, what else could you possibly want in life?

Personally, I would only come if I had window seats. It started with small bread muffins, the butter mixture for this was very tasty. We ordered the seafood trio and braised rib sliders for an appetizer. The trio was okay, the shrimp was amazing but only two pieces. The lobster was good. The piece of fish that came with it I wasn't a fan of. If I could, I would order just the shrimp next time. For our main courses I got the roasted chicken and lobster Mac and cheese. My boyfriend got the braised ribs and fillet. We both enjoyed our dish. The lobster Mac and Cheese was heavenly. I would order five servings without regret. Definitely try this.

Over the years they continued to increase their costs and fees and are now more expensive than most other veterinary practices in the area. They are absolutely outrageous! Your pet can't even be seen for under $90. They completely take advantage of us pet owners. Everyone I have spoken to has spent thousands of dollars on their animals while using this practice, myself included, for minor types of issues. Because one of my dogs hadn't been there in in a couple years they wouldn't give me flea and tick medicine for her! Though they have seen my other dog within the past six months. They said that they would require her to receive a check up and have some blood work done before they would give her flea and tick medicine. Spend a large amount of money just so that I can purchase flea and tick medicine?! I don't think so! The last time I walked in with my other dog they wanted to immediately do a full panel of bloodwork, which normally costs upwards of $300, just to take a look at his teeth. My neighbor had an issue where she took in her dog to be groomed and they decided to give the dog a check up from an issue a few weeks prior and then proceeded to charge her for the visit without even getting her permission! Another neighbor spent thousands because her dog gets kidney stones from not drinking enough water and even once he was better they continued to run another panel of tests costing her even more money! I have since vowed never to set foot in this place again. I'm sure there are many other people who are crying poverty because of this place and how they push you into paying for tons of tests and vaccinations and medicines. It's a complete scam!

Brisk take out business so sometimes server disappeared since he was dealing with orders. Accurate and friendly service. Amazing vegan options and equally great meat options. Ordered the half meat sampler with spicy vegan coleslaw. Coleslaw is great with jalape\u00f1os. They have spicy sauces if you ask, both were good. The sauces were cold though, so the barely warm meat was cool after being in the sauce. Meats were excellent. Pulled pork was juicy and well flavored, though not very smokey.

{"text":"First time coming here and I can honestly say I won't be back. Let me first say that the girl who did my nails did a great job yet I have a huge issue with time management being that I was a first time customer. So I have my regular nail tech that I go to yet because I broke a nail the night before and had to be up super early to go to work, I needed to get my nail fixed right away. Everywhere I looked said that they would be open by 10 yet when I saw that Kathy's opened at 9, I was beyond excited. Yet when I got there at 9:05am no one was there and another customer and myself had to wait until 9:30. I called the number to see if anyone was there and right when the phone was answered, that's when they opened the door. Why have it posted online and on your front door that you open at 9am yet get there whenever you want? That's really bad business. The girl who did my nails asked where I was from and I told her and then she felt the need to explain that why would I call a business when no one is there... Which was odd to me because she made it seem like I was wrong. To which I explained her, that if you are running a business and you have your hours posted then you should be there. This is a business and you should treat it as such. She then went on how there was traffic and they live on the westbank... And I get it, there are always issues that we can't foresee... Yet that also tells me that if you know where you live is known for traffic, you get up earlier to be at your job a little earlier vs being 30mins late. Don't argue with a new potential customer. Kathy's lost a customer based on that. Great service and great job yet very bad time management. When you know better, you do better.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Sampan has the BEST happy hour in the city! Their food on happy hour is between $2-$4, and lemme tell you, it's a steal! I would suggest going with a couple friends and ordering several things to munch on together. I highly recommend the Kim Chee fried rice... very flavorful and a good sized portion. Other favorite items include the brussel sprouts (crispy and just the right spices), potstickers, and the korean BBQ beef satay... DELICIOUS.. but it only comes with 2 skewers. If you're here with friends make sure you get a couple orders of the beef satay because you will all want them. I've tried almost everything here, the only thing I wasn't a fan of was the edamame dumplings, everything else is so delicious. I know I used that word once already in this review but there's not a better word to describe their food! You will not be disappointed. I've always had great service here, everyone is very friendly. They're extremely busy during happy hour, so try not to come with a big group if you want to find seats. If the inside area is full, head out back to their graffiti bar... same menu and prices, just some extended seating! It's covered and they have heaters out back if you're worried about the cold.","stars":5.0}

Located at the beautiful International Plaza, Rocco's has indoor and outdoor seating to suit either mood. The vibe includes a lively atmosphere with brightly colored decor, an upbeat crowd, and a DJ spinning the latest tunes from inside a booth made from the shell of an old school Volkswagen van. Reservations are recommended since without them my party of 2 were told that the wait was 1 1\/2 hours. We accepted the wait and decided to scope out the mall next door. We were happy to find out that the wait was much shorter than we were originally told. But the best part is that the food and the service were worth the wait! We opted for patio seating. Our server approached within seconds of us being seated. We ordered a pitcher of the freshly made white sangria (yum!) and the guacamole which is made at the table side (more yum!). We then moved onto the rest of the menu with my friend choosing the steak quesadillas and me settling on the shrimp tacos. The food came to the table quickly and our chatter was promptly quieted by our immediate chowing down on the delicious food.

{"text":"No giving u water, relaxation room is pointless, massage is NOT an hour long, constant sounds of tiny lotion bottle lids being opened and shut and the sound of lotion squirting out, no hot towels, no initial relaxation pressure to get you relaxed and if this place does anything for u, they act like they are really doing you a favor. They just don't get it that customers are the ones doing them a favor by choosing to spend their money at this place of business rather than somewhere else. It isn't a partnership, it's a service. If I pay you, YOU WORK FOR ME! That is what the service industry is! The costumer experience is the most important part of your business. Everything else is a cost. It seems people have forgotten this. Managers, therapists, buildings, supplies. You are all costs that without loyal customers, will soon be finding yourself out of business and unemployed. If you think corporate isn't brainstorming ideas to keep customers, even the ones who might be going outside of the contract a bit, you are kidding yourself. They probably ask how many contract renewals you get. Going above and beyond is expected if you want my business. It's my hard earned money that I have to sweat for and I choose where to spend it. Why would I just give it to someplace for a low class customer experience. Some people have to work 8 hours to afford 1 hour here. They just don't seem to understand that here. My husband bought a membership for me for my birthday. He's a man. They don't pay much attention. I didn't start using it right away and the third from the last message they wanted me to pay for!! Apparently, you MUST use 6 massages within 6 months. I was obviously surprised. The manager agreed after throwing the contract in my face to extend me 30 days for the other two. So 3 massages in 30 days. I only wish I had that time. Here's the crappy part. The manager says, your husband was supposed to tell you. Let me be clear. Bad business practice: sell gift membership and never go over contract or rules with gift recipient when they first come in, then throw contract in recipients face and act like you are doing them a favor if you extend 30 days (bearing in mind you have been paid in advance). Good business practice (AKA not what happened): Explain terms of contract and all expectations to both customer at time of purchase, and recipient upon activating membership, which is not activated until recipient comes in for first massage, therefore creating known expectations and avoiding confusion relying on information or anything else getting from one person to another. Main point being, don't go here if you have high expectations. I apologize for any typos as I am writing this from my phone.","stars":1.0}

If you're \"hungry like the wolf\" (sorry, I had to go there), pop in next door for what smelled like good, greasy bar food (I did not indulge). It's also a good spot for a breather, as there are seats. The main venue doesn't have as much as a banquet.

First, we made reservations and even with the craziness of the pandemic and what not, we were seated right away in a nice tucked away corner for our party of 7. The wait staff from start to end was a totally 5\/5 stars. The hostess was organized and well put together. Our waitress was friendly and well skilled and even with being newish you would have never guessed she hadn't have been working there for years! The food runners were also fab and well COVID cautious. They even were cool with my brother bringing the home made birthday cake, which was actually his bread pudding. They even had a serving spoons and extra plates. The restaurant was upper scale class wise but the prices for the holy cow amazing inventive menu and quality ingredients was off the charts. They have something for everyone too, vegan, keto, vegetarian, meat eaters, gluten free. They have bread that is complementary and pretty amazing, artisan istic. Definitely not your run of the mill. And the entrees comes with the option of a soup or salad. The house salad was just right with apples, cranberries and blue cheese. Very tasty and the Mexican meatball soup that night was not a dinky portion. The spareribs with a huge hit and so was the raviolis and my dad and step mom just loved the French dip which was gigantic. I mean the sandwich probably weighs about 2 pounds in meat. I split the cauliflower ceviche with the huge home made chips and the corn risotto with my mom. And I have to say the depth of flavor and complexity was pretty outstanding. The cilantro and pickle in the ceviche would never have your missing seafood and the portion is the size of a meal, I would have loved some chunks of avocado but wasn't necessary. The corn risotto was creamy and the cheese on it was excellent. I generally don't like cherry tomatoes much but it went with this so perfectly and the puree at the bottom tied in the flavors like a silver bow on a bell.","stars":5.0}

We were seated promptly. First thing I noticed was the high level of sound due to brick and steel interior, so some sound dampening may be welcome. Our server Jeremy was great, guiding us to good cocktails and food selection. I got the Monte cocktail which was good, and my wife got the Boulevardier, which was awesome! For apps we ordered Veal meatballs, really good, Beet and Burrata, also really good, and the reason for the less than 5 star review, the \"Crispy Enoki Mushrooms\". The appetizers came out surprisingly fast for such a crowded restaurant. The aforementioned mushrooms were nothing nothing more than wisps of batter, with virtually no enoki mushrooms to be found. I mentioned this to Jeremy who said he would tell the kitchen. We finished the rest of the apps but left most of the mushroom dough on the plate. The dinner was also delivered quickly with the winner being the huge Colorado lamb chops for my wife and I had the Pork chop which was done medium well. I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked. I would prefer it to be more medium on the rare side. The manager did come over and ask how everything was. I mentioned our disappointment with the mushrooms and how everything else was a home run. He seemed to care about our comments. Most high end restarurants, which I think Urban Stillhouse is shooting for, would have taken the mushrooms off the bill. Or at least comped a desert or something. I even bet our friends it wouldn't be on the bill. I lost. There it was, a $12 charge for mushroom flavored batter. So go and enjoy this place, just don't order the mushrooms ;)","stars":4.0}

Yelp reviewers led us to Parkway and we could not be more grateful! We ordered the shrimp poboy and the oyster poboy. For a side, we added a shared order of French fries with gravy. The poboys are \"dressed\" with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and a light spread of mayo. Adding your own Crystal hot sauce tableside is a must. It really elevates the outstanding to amazing. The homemade beef gravy on the fries is ladled with fresh bits of pulled roast beef that is tender and flavorful. The beef turned a side into an almost meal of its own. The seafood has a light breading that keeps the flavor and moisture in without being heavy or greasy. Oysters are my new passion after this trip and the fried option in a sandwich was not something I expected to love as much as I did. Now I can't wait to go back and do it all again.

{"text":"Brassiere St. James impressed me greatly with my one meal there. I think we may be sensing a seismic shift in Reno's dining scene as Brassiere St. James takes some of the hip coolness from Campo. In many ways it hits where Campo aims by making high quality, simple food. The menu is pretty much high-end bar food. There's meats, cheeses, sandwiches, pizza (they call it flat bread) and some fried foods. Nothing too complex. But it seems to deliver it in high quality. I only had a beer, French fries and sausages. But I was looking at what others were eating and saying and it seems like they were pretty much hitting across the board. There was some confusion among the staff as to what part of the menu I could order from since I got there before 5 p.m. I settled on three sausages for $12, French fries for $5 and a $6 wheat beer called The Whitte Album. The beer arrived first. It was simple. It served its purpose in that it wasn't hoppy so it didn't have the bitterness I don't like in ales. I was happy to drink it but I wouldn't come here just for that beer. The French fries were cut thin and were perfectly cooked. If you like In N Out burger fries you'll like these. It would be nice to get something different, like spices or pepper or something. The fries came with a garlic aoli sauce and a smokey ketchup that were nice. The aoli could use a little more zing. I got three kinds of house-made sausage, a lamb, an Italian and I forget the third type. All were excellent. Fresh and tasty and quite distinctive. This was a winner. I hope they keep up this quality. It makes me want to try the charcuterie plate. I have to give them a shout out for their nice wine list. There's maybe one trophy wine, a Chateaunuef-du-pape sold only by the bottle. Everything else is sold by the glass and they have lots of food-friendly wine for $7 to $10 a glass, including a Scott Harvey barbera from Amador County, a couple of Rhone blends, a Burgundy, an Alsace pinot blanc and a German riesling. This is a more diverse wine list than three-fourths of the Reno restaurants, which focus on cabernet sauvignon and oaky chardonnay. Of course, just because they put it on the wine list doesn't mean the public will buy it. And they serve wine in regular stems, not tumblers like Campo. The vibe was nice too. I noticed a lot of the customers were middle-aged men wearing baseball-style caps. So it seems, based on my one experience there, to have more of a masculine feel compared to say Campo's elegant feel. I went opening day and the staff seems to be working out the bugs. There were plenty of employees on hand, which I take as a good sign. Finding the door was a bit of a task and they could mark it better. I actually parked near","stars":4.0}

It came with beans, a corn crunchy tortilla, a egg shapped like a taco that was filled with onions,ground beef ,scallions and spices. Served with the tostada is a generous helping of fresh fruit. This breakfast was not by any means exceptional, but it was very good. The price was also awesome, out the door for 10 bucks. I will definitely be back.","stars":4.0}

The positives have been mentioned (chili cheese etouffee, low price, quick service, etc.) This location definitely does not have the atmosphere, but I don't see any difference in the food quality. What keeps Yats from being a 5 star for me is their limited menu choices and that I've been in a few times where they've run out of stuff. When there's only a few things to pick from, it really stinks when something is cleaned out. However, for a Midwestern town, Yats is a good cajun\/creole spot.","stars":4.0}

I learned of the McKenna museum simply by googling black museums in New Orleans and they are by appointment only, so I submitted a request online. They got back to me very quickly with a scheduled tour time on a Tuesday morning and were early arriving to it. We received an amazingly informative and dynamic tour from the fabulous Kim, who is literally a wealth of knowledge. The house had been previously dilapidated before being purchased and renovated by the McKenna family and the exhibits are themed by room, ranging from themed around black men, black women, voodoo, and more. All of the art was amazing. You must, must go.","stars":5.0}

I ordered a 2 piece spicy white and she asked if I wanted the number two and I said yes but without the drink and she said , in the most facetious and rude way, \"well you don't want a number 2 then\" and proceeded to be even more rude.

I was trying to be health conscious and made the mistake of substituting the cheez wiz with provolone. I love provolone but there's always a reason why you stick with the original and don't mess with it. My boyfriend noted that they use minced meat instead of slabs of beef which really really makes a difference in my opinion. The meat soaks up all the wonderful juices and the cheez wiz. I am so sad that I didn't get it with the wiz but this only gives me another reason to come!

From the floors to the table and menus, to the doors of the restrooms, everything is sticky. I can't say if it's due to lack of cleaning, which causes these surfaces and items to be sticky. Or maybe it's because everything is wood, and nobody has been properly trained on cleaning techniques for wood surfaces. Either way, this location leaves a lot to be desired. We've been here a few times, when we have a crab fry craving. Living in Lower Bucks county, could either go to this Bordentown location or the Roosevelt Blvd. location, both are equidistant from our residence. Having said that, we visited Bordentown twice within six months and both times we weren't 100% satisfied with the food, atmosphere, or service. A lot does have to do with the cleanliness of the restaurant, but the service isn't great and the crab fries could have been more flavored. Didn't have enough crab\/ old bay spices. We've dined here twice as I mentioned, once on a weekend and once during the week, both for dinner, it wasn't crowded at all. For me that's a telltale sign that this isn't a popular location OR they just don't like it's stickiness.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"By far the worst experience, service and stay I have ever had in my life at a Sheraton Let's start with my room being canceled, merely because I had called and asked about what the penalty would be for canceling my reservations within 24hours of my stay. They assumed I didn't want to arrive and just canceled without my request. I arrived at hotel and did not have a room. I was told to look around for other hotels. After fighting that I would not leave bc I did not cancel, finally a single miracle room showed up. ;( I had to wait almost 2 hours with my children already anxious from my 2 hour drive, in my car bc I couldn't wait in the lobby as the smell of leaking gas from fire place was unbearable. While Hoping and praying that the front desk could fix their mistake, I almost also wanted to find another hotel as I was afraid the hotel would explode . At this point I just want to get into room and prepare children for bed. Well to my surprise the service elevator was The ONLY working elevator and took me an addition 15 min wait to get into room. All guest that walked into the elevator that stopped at every floor, along with the housekeepers pulling garbage and dirty linen into the same elevator, were all complaining. The elevator had been down for days. Get into room and the smell of wet soggy carpet was the worst. Dirty bathroom grimy walls even the remote was filthy. God what have we gotten ourselves into. Without continuing with the long trauma and nightmare. Let me finish by saying that when i needed ice for the $3 bottled water in the room bc the fridge was not working, i decided to go get ice from machine..... guess what didn't work? Yup, The ice machine. Had to wait another 10 minutes for elevator to go down to front desk to get ice. Front desk gave me ice in a tiny ziplock bag. Which almost melted by the time i got back in my room. unbelievable. EVERY Employee was completely bothered. From Crystal at the reservations when i called to inquire about cancellation. Davian at front Desk when i arrived to my canceled reservation and just couldn't help me and left me to figure out on my own.

The food was delicious. We had the daily flat bread, a sampling of meats and cheeses, bruschetta, and a salad. I forget the bottle of red wine I ordered, but it was fantastic and not overly priced for a restaurant. The only downside was it was really noisy and crowded. There was a Sweet Sixteen event upstairs which sounded as if a bunch of cattle were stampeding over our heads. Additionally, we were seated at a table in the right next to a booth with very little room in between. The host (manager perhaps?) must have known the person seated in the booth next to us because he talked to them for some time with his rear end faced towards us. Not a bad view, but not something I would like to see while I'm enjoying a meal. I will most likely visit Teca again to try their happy hour or check out the upstairs section.

There's a raised platform area, bench seating, booths and counter space. We were seated and our order taken quickly. We ordered 4 different rolls and 2 pieces of sushi to split amongst 2 people - 2 unagi sushi, salmon press, TNT, California roll and Mango Fry. Food came as it ready so it almost felt like we having a multi-course meal which was kind of nice. It gave us the opportunity to really enjoy each roll individually opposed to just eating all the sushi we could. All the rolls were good but I think our consensus was that we liked the salmon press and TNT the best. $$$ wise, japonais bistro is fairly on par with places like Mikado. Our meal came to around $60 which I felt was close to the same in price. It's definitely not the cheapest sushi in Edmonton but I felt for the quality and atmosphere, it was fair. I would absolute go back to Japonais Bistro and will likely start using it as one of my go to sushi places in the city.","stars":5.0}

This is one of the most professional and clean salons I have been to and I am so glad I found this place when I moved to Philly.

She also works with your schedule and is very timely. ( No 10 hour braiding sessions, I just don't have the time or patience for that). I also appreciate her professionalism. She doesn't chat on the phone the entire time or stop braiding in the middle and ask me to pay, or have me hold her messy cheese curl eating child. Yes, I've experienced those things from other salons (craziness) so this place is truly a breath of fresh air. I've recommended 2 friends and my sister and they all loved their hair as well.

Would love to have another option though. Too few blackjack tables unless you're a $50\/hand player. As is often the case, the ratio of tables to machines is annoying... if you're a machines player, the popular games are usually occupied but the unpopular ones will be empty for rows. The buffet is good, but a bit overpriced. The steakhouse is excellent if you are lucky at the tables. The Cafe is a good bar environment, but can be a bit loud and smoky if you're dining.","stars":3.0}

They offer an extensive menu. \"Ralph's Famous Fries\" is one of my go to appetizers, whiz and garlicky sauce. It cannot be beat for $2.50. I've been going here for years.

Instead of 'splitting' it as she said they bring us two of the smaller 3 cheese\/ meat boards and then charged us the $20 for each of them instead of the 5 cheese\/ meat for $25. Half hour later dinners start arriving. 3 arrive. 10 minutes go by and another 2 arrive. Another 10 minutes and 2 more. The 8th and final? My cousins pizza never arrived. My food was bland, my moms over cooked, my aunts had been sitting under the heat lamp so long her cheese sauce was now so rubbery it had to be cut with a knife. My cousin ordered stuffed chicken breast, the toothpick stuffed inside was an extra surprise! When we brought this to the managers attention we were told they don't use toothpicks in the kitchen. :\/ in the end they did remove the chicken from the bill. To end the evening we asked them to split the bill evenly between two credit cards, they split it and ran it on the same card twice.

{"text":"This is a place where I use to go with my family all the time. Especially this one because we all lived on this side of town our whole lives. I walked in to grab a bite to eat while my mom was getting a hair cut next door. I walked in but there was no one standing at the counter but when I got up to the counter there was a lady and she was doing some type of cleaning or prep work she knew I was standing there but she didn't acknowledge me or say say hi for a good 30 seconds or so. Finally when she said hi very dreadfully and asked me what i wanted. I told her a very basic order and she didn't even bother to look at me and she had to ask me again what i wanted. A younger gentlemen helped me out at the register and he was very nice and sweet, no problems there. I went to sit down and noticed that there was clutter everywhere. There was a half a bagel and drink sitting on the table next to me, there were crumbs everywhere on the floor. The trash bin had paper liners scattered on the top of it and tables seemed to not be wiped down. It was super quiet I only saw one customer in there besides me and one that came in for a brief second and then left. It just seemed like such a dreadful place and the employees didn't seem happy. tHe customer service was ok and the cleanliness was not up to par. The food I got was ok, it was kind of stale and chewy. And one last thing, the lady asked me if i wanted my bagel toasted and she never did toast it. That is why it was chewy. She did nothing that I really wanted besides throw a bagel and cheese together. The only thing that made it nice was when I left the guy noticed me leaving and told me to have a good day. I am not sure if I would go back to this one, but if I did I probably wont eat in. Ill just take it to go next time. Hopefully they fix there wi-fi for their guests, its locked and i couldn't use my tablet. It was very dissappointing coming back.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"The pickup process was not organized at all. We went to the three hostesses at the front (why there were three, I'm not sure) and said we had a carryout order. They said \"oh yeah, the bar will take care of that.\" We went to the bar... awkwardly stood around because there's not a \"to-go pickup\" area... and then eventually got closer to the bar to try to talk to someone. The man at the bar went to look for our carryout order and picked one up, checked it, and said \"oh if you ordered online you need to go to the front.\" Well, that's where we just were, but we went to the front again anyway. Now it's been at least 10-15 minutes since the time my $30 burger and fries meal should have been ready, and I see a staff member take a carryout bag over to the bar. It sits there for 3-4 minutes before I finally ask the three hostesses what the actual system is for picking up an order, and one of them runs to the kitchen to find my order. She then goes over to the bar and picks up the bag that has been sitting there. Of course, when I get home the food is cold, yet my burger was still cooked well-done, when I ordered medium. At least my boyfriend got his cooked right, albeit cold as well. I had a phenomenal meal here on Monday, and I really wanted to show my boyfriend how amazing this place is, but after tonight, I will likely never return.

Well now that I'm of age and most typical adult duties have been put upon me I still like using this place. First off they're cheap, cheaper than most Jiffy Lubes and way cheaper than the Valvoline down the road. Plus they do a good job. My family and I have never had any problems here in 20 years, and regardless of what we had done it was always done well. By the way they're usually pretty fast.

I also ordered the over baked wings, half franks red hot and other half creamy garlic and both of them just tasted nasty. My wings tasted like you can get them from a frozen bag in Walmart and the creamy garlic sauce was way too much garlic and tasted nasty. Not to mention, the wings come with celery and carrots and they can't even use real carrot sticks, they gave me baby carrots that you can get in Costco in a huge bulk. Also, I ordered 2 extra ranch on the side along with the ranch I get with the wings and all I got was 1 ranch for 10 Wong's, celery, carrots, and a whole pizza. For sure will never order from here again, maybe it's because I ordered from ubereats they just didn't care about the quality of my food otherwise i wouldn't have paid for it if I was in the restaurant.","stars":1.0}

They have soy milk for their lattes if you are lactose intolerant. The staff are very friendly and always helpful to explain anything from the menu. If you are new to matcha and want their soft serve, start with the vanilla\/matcha mix, all matcha may be too strong to start with off the bat.

The first time you do something wonderful, experience joy, or pass out naked in the Vatican wearing only a beer can hat...it is burned in your soul and your only desire is relive that moment. It becomes an obsession. It becomes a quest. A pain in your heart and a blackening of your spirit each time you cannot grab a hold of that dragon and suck the marrow from his bones. My dragons have almost killed me. My dragons have saved me. My dragons have almost ruined me. My dragons have enriched my life. Meet my newest dragon...L'angelo Ristorante. People I trusted, people who know good food, people who I have spend 17 years in a 10x10 cage, would rave to me about L'angelo...they would tell me how truly special this little BYOB off of broad street was. I would dismiss them. I would curse them. I would flail at them with sharp objects. Eventually, they gave me some money and with the money I made collecting cans it was time to take the woman I am currently living with. The bane of my existence. Several times we sampled the goodness L'agnelo had to offer, and each time I loved it even more. I was told that this would be the best meal I have ever had. I am not quite ready to say that, but I will say that it is has had the single best Italian dish of my life, and that it has had the most constantly spectacular meals of my life. Without reciting the menu, which never really seems to change, and that is a great thing, I will explain what this place is NOT. It is NOT a place where you stuff yourself with 2lbs of pasta. It is not a spacious, well lit, cavernous chain Italian eatery. It is not a place you should eat wearing a baseball hat or a hoodie...idiot in the red...you know who you are. What this is...is brilliant. It is simple, unpretentious food done perfectly. It is the excellence of execution (sorry Bret Hart), it is haunting beauty of simply prepared ingredients done perfectly. Nothing is over the top. Everything feels like you can make it at home...until the car ride back and every millimeter towards your destination tells you that the best you could ever do is a pathetic recreation of elegant simplicity. The best Italian dish I have ever had is their appetizer. It is a baked trio of mushrooms mixed with garlic and fresh rosemary covered in fontina cheese. Sound simple. It is. Sound like something you can make at home. It isn't. It is so perfectly prepared that I have ate it every time I have gone to L'angelo. The owner has given us their homemade leminchello made with grain alcohol for free every time I have eaten there. Made on premises and it is again perfect","stars":5.0}

{"text":"So I rolled in here for some takeout tacos after a show at the Pageant. The little takeout counter is very cute and the woman working was super nice. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. Have you seen that website where they show the advertised fast food photo next to the real thing? The beautiful hamburger with glistening lettuce and tomatoes on the perfect bun compared to the sideways smashed road kill looking burger with random sauces oozing out? It was kind of like that. When I opened my box, all the toppings had fallen off and were in a little jumbled piles. I tried to resurrect my tacos using online descriptions. But sadly, my tacos were a mere shell (pun intended) of the ones promised in the menu. I ordered the grilled fish taco and the duck taco. Per the menu, the fish taco is supposed to come with fish, sauce, cabbage, pico de gallo, and queso fresco. I got fish (thank God for that), about 3 shreds of cabbage and maybe a quarter of a cherry tomato. My sauce was ordered on the side. No queso to speak of. It was basically a sad little piece of fish all alone in a tortilla. The duck taco is supposed to have duck, pork belly, avocado, and sauce. This one fared slightly better, but still no avocado. I'm not 100% sure about the pork belly either, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on that one. Looking at even the Yelp photos of beautiful tacos in the cute little taco holder made me feel even worse. I'll have to try dining in next time. Yeah, so I ordered takeout and didn't check my food. Rookie mistake. But, I gave Mission more credit than that.","stars":3.0}

And the bagels w\/ lox, cucumber, red onion, lettuce, avocado mash & cream cheese is the best. (the bagels are made in the kitchen and the salmon is smoked out back.) . Surrey's also is a juice bar. The juice is a little pricey but well worth it. They have a beautiful selection of fruits and veggies to drink, I have tried the carrot with fresh ginger added and the cucumber. I haven't been to Surreys for lunch, but the menu looks as good as the breakfast choices. If youre in New Orleans, you will not regret going to Surrey's.

Because I feel so guilty after having a muffin, I opt for a lighter breakfast here. Open-faced three egg white omelet with spinach, mushrooms, caramelized onions, tomatoes and goat cheese. But it still can add up to 800+ calories in one meal. Ugh, takes the fun out of eating, doesn't it? The service is good here. I come pretty early, usually on a Sunday and we beat the crowds.

{"text":"Excellent Mexican food with a few shortcomings that may not really be shortcomings depending on your expectations. Let's start with the good\/great - the mole is money. Mole chicken enchiladas or burrito is a unique and (seemingly authentic from what I can gather) delicious, rich sauce that is definitely worth trying. The al pastor and shrimp tacos are light, fresh, and hit the spot. Everything is made fresh and in full display. The kitchen is small but clean, efficient and give me much more confidence than bigger restaurants with closed kitchens. The minor shortcomings are the chips and salsa are suboptimal but I prefer the tex mex type pureed tomato, cilantro and onion type sauce. They take a bit of time - which is understandable given everything is made to order (mole is made batch by batch!). The prices are a few dollars more than one would expect as well. Nonetheless, I'm super grateful this place is around. Nothing quite hits the spot like a little El Purepecha take out and homemade margaritas!","stars":4.0}

There was a long line to purchase tickets as well as snaking concession stand lines. Entry into the theater is a single aisle and no matter where you sit, someone is gonna try and slide by you or you'll be teetering by to get to your seat. Would be great if there were aisles on each sides so that there is an easier transition to\/from your seat. No complaints on the seats I found. Upon exiting the theater, I went to to the ladies room right outside and of course there was a line for the 3 stalls and 10 women\/girls waiting. One of the stalls was out of order and I went to the restroom in the entry\/game area. More stalls in this one but I was totally miffed when I went to wash my hands and there was grey water stagnant in the sink. I brought it to the manager's attention and he seemed a bit nonchalant about me reporting it and gave me some scripted blurb about how they're working on it. Other areas of the bathroom needed some attention but I really wasn't in the mood for another rehearsed spiel. Some of the workers were a wee bit too familiar with one another but there are a few who were attentive and performing their duties as required.

{"text":"I was really excited to try this place as it has a good variety of vegan dishes at a decent price. Sabrina's Cafe is usually my go to for lunch, but it's nice to find a place that has tasty, and fresh food at a cheaper cost. It's also BYOB which is a ++. The exterior needs work, but I get the feeling that they are still finalizing construction inside and outside. My party of 4 arrives around 11am on a Saturday, and we are probably only the 6th table in the place so it didn't seem like they had a lot of customers that morning. They were out of the steak benedict that someone in my party was really excited to try, and they were out of the Teriyaki Seitan that I tried to order myself. Out of several vegan dishes that were on the menu I was only presented with two options that I could choose from. Disappointing. Mind you the place is only open from 6am to 2pm and halfway through the day at peak brunch hour they are sold out of key items. We weren't the only table being told that a dish was unavailable. So then I choose what may be one of their simplest dishes; cauliflower tacos. The rest of my party gets their food (enchiladas, nawlings skillet, eggs benedict), and I'm told my dish will only be a couple minutes late because they are making it fresh. Oh great, sounds like another dish that wasn't prepped. So about 5-10 minutes goes by as my party is digging into their dish and my three cauliflower tacos are still not ready. I have to get up, find my server, and he apologetically repeats that it's being made fresh. So basically that was another dish that wasn't prepped this morning or they already ran out of and they didn't want to tell us about a third unavailable dish. About 5 more minutes after that I get my tacos. Mind you that these don't even come with a side of rice and beans, but as I now live in LA I just chalked it up to being $3 per taco. The taste was....ok. It wasn't worth a 15 minute wait AFTER the rest of my party had been served. Oh and also a side of breakfast potatoes we initially ordered was forgotten about several times and didn't come out until 5 minutes after I received my food. The skillet lacked in its protein, and looked pretty sad. The benedict was \"not hot\" according to my MIL, but my SIL really liked the taste of her enchiladas. There was no manager making the rounds to see if service was up to par which I'm used to especially with a new restaurant [ETA: Wow, this place isn't even THAT new], and our server didn't even offer a discount for the unaccepted wait time. This place could be something, but I get turned off very quickly when a kitchen is unprepared and there's a lack of hospitality.","stars":2.0}

The idea of the restaurant is great but once I received raw chicken and had to boil it myself in broth I was just over this place. The menu is hard to understand and is very misleading. Reading it gave me anxiety... I'm not exactly sure why I was under the impression that the food came out cooked and all you did was dip it cooked into fondue cheeses etc. No you get it all Raw with broth that the whole table has to decide what flavor or cooking style! My friend got the tuna so you can only imagine raw chicken, tuna and steak floating around in broth is like! Our server was great! We would have done dessert if it didn't take 1 hour between appetizer to disappointing meal! This place is just strange I wouldn't recommend it or even come back. I spent $200 for a few hunks of raw meats, chicken broth, and melted cheese. Save your money people!","stars":1.0}

The crust was light & thin and bubbling with cheese. The pepperoni had the perfect kick to it, a little spicy, with a little saltiness. Dessert was ok, but not very memorable. I enjoyed this restaurant and would definitely return. They served a great bread upon being seated.... and I love great bread served with rich flavorful dipping oils.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I must be getting old because the music they had playing nearly blew out my eardrum. My hubby and I checked out this place for dinner the other night. It has a small footprint but only one other group was there besides us, so we were seated right away. It was the day before a menu change so they were out of probably 30% of items. I got the chicken wings. They were decent but for a place that specializes in chicken, I don't know, I guess I was expecting more. For you sauce lovers, they do have an overwhelming amount of in house sauces. I tried the maple mustard and the aioli, both slightly odd but good. I got the Mac n cheese as a side, which was tasty. They crushed red hot ripplets on the top which sort of ruined the Mac for me. My hubby got the motherclucker, which he liked. He also got the spiced tots, which was probably the best thing we had. The drink menu looked yummy, my hubby just got a local beer on draft. Service was okay, the loud music really was deafening and distracting.

They have outdoor heaters, and the patio is covered, with the ability to put the sides down in cold or in-climate weather. Our server Julie was well informed, very enthusiastic and fun to talk to. All the staff we met were very friendly. We started off with 2 interesting cocktails - a Green Chile Gimlet and a Beefeaters Gin drink called \"Bees Knees\". Both were delicious and were also a surprise Anniversary gift from our Aunt Renee. There were many delicious sounding appetizers to chose from. We had the Oysters Rockefeller with chorizo, potato, garlic thyme cream and arugula which was very good. The other was one you don't see on many menus - Rabbit Pot Pie. This was served in a small ramekin with it's light crust covering a mixture of rabbit, potatoes, root vegetables and a creamy wine-hinted sauce. Although very good, I like the version served at The Dandelion in Center City Philadelphia better. For entrees we had the Roasted Duck Breast with green lentils, fava beans, English peas and creamed wild mushrooms. For my taste it needed a \"punch\" of maybe some additional seasoning. The Monkfish Osso Buco was very good and perfectly cooked and was served with a lobster bread pudding, English peas, and a rich savory sauce. Our shared desert was a brownie with a layer of chocolate mousse and chocolate ganache over the top. It was served beautifully over a chocolate mosaic design on the plate and it was also a gift for our Anniversary from the Chef. With its beautiful setting and interesting menu we will be sure to come back again.","stars":4.0}

It was like that for the first two walks and then, without asking or notifying me, a man started walking my dog. It may have been fine if they had asked me and done some kind of meet and greet, but nothing like that happened. To this day, I still never met the guy who was going into my apartment and walking my dog. They also were weird about leaving notes after the walk. Every other dog walking service does this, and they acted like I was putting them out big time by asking for them to write \"peed & pooped\" on a piece of paper. They also forgot to come twice. The first time they apologized and made it up to me with 3 free walks. The second time they forgot to walk my dog, they straight up lied to me about it. That's when I went elsewhere for my dog walking needs. I found a walking service in the area that is leaps and bounds above this shady mess. Beware!","stars":1.0}

We started with Ruth & Ruth with a move-in clean, after we had purchased and done some renovations to our house. This process was pretty hectic with regards to scheduling, where we wanted cleaning done after the counters and carpet but before the movers--Ruth was extremely flexible and easy to work with, even when I asked for some last-minute schedule changes. Once we got all of our stuff in, we've had them come regularly (at first once and month, then twice a month after we got a dog). The girls that come are reliable, friendly, and work extremely hard to make my house sparkling and a joy to come home to. Ruth has consistently asked for feedback on my cleaning to make sure that she is meeting my expectations, and has quickly resolved any questions or concerns that I have. Their prices seem reasonable to me, and definitely worth the benefit I get from it. One note: Ruth mentioned to me that they don't generally do move-in\/move-out cleans unless you are going to have them clean your house regularly after that (at least that's what I heard). She said that it's just too much work to do those really deep cleans and the price they would have to charge to justify it would be outrageous. But, she's definitely willing to work with you for those types of cleanings if you want to work with them over a longer period of time. If you're in the market for a cleaning company, this is definitely a good one to get.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Just bought a 2015 chevy equinox with 50k miles on it.. happy with the vehicle and was happy with the customer service of sales consultant Michael H., APR is high though even with a co-signer with excellent credit and a little bit of a down payment. Was not happy with the customer service of a manager named Greg over the phone. A couple days after purchasing the vehicle i noticed a squeeking noise while going over speedbumps. Called and made an appointment for an inspection. Also noticed the tires obviously need a rotation. (Front tires much more bald than back tires). Took it for the inspection and they drove it around the block and it wouldnt make the squeeking noise because there are no speed bumps around the store. But they didnt inspect anything... and they said they checked the tires and they are still up to \"carmax standard\" so they didnt do a rotation. I watched them walk up to the vehicle, get right in and drive around the block came back parked it and came right back inside without even looking at the tires. How'd they check the tires without looking at them? Getting back home the vehicle of course squeeks as i pull over a speed bump. So now i gotta call again and make another inspection appointment... and probably pay for a tire rotation even though I just purchased the vehicle... not happy with the service center.","stars":2.0}

The lemon mixed with the (what I believe to be) cayenne pepper and the crunchiness of the pumpkin seeds was a great combo. I gave this place 3 stars because I believe customer service matters. I was the only person in the store and yet it took 30 minutes for me to get my order. I'm not sure why it would take 30 minutes to put avocado on toast but it was especially irritating because there was no sense of urgency. With that being said, they will ask you if you would like to tip before you receive your food. I would hold off on tipping until after you receive your order to make sure you enjoy your service, because that only makes sense.","stars":3.0}

I was told over the phone that my order would be ready in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my food. I was never asked for my name or phone number when I placed my order. When I arrived the young woman who I know took my order asked \"did you leave a name by chance?\" I said no. Then she asked what I ordered and I told her. She then went to back of the restaurant to another cash register and STAYED back there for 10 minutes. So eventually I asked the man at the front of the restaurant (who I assume was the manager) if he knew what was going on with my order. He said he did not know but he would check on it in a minute. The young woman finally came back to the front of the store (not for me however) and the manager asked where was my order because he was trying to find it in the system. She said she didn't know because she didn't take my order (which was not true). Then they both went to the back of the restaurant. The manager comes back and says \"I found out what happened, she never put your order in but she just put it in for you right now\". WHAT?!?! By this time, I did not have anymore time to wait and had to leave empty handed!!! WHAT THE PHO?!?!?! Please hire some more experienced staff who know how to handle customer service.

We sat outside, and it was nice to have a small heater on our table, although it did have to be replaced halfway through the meal. For our first course, I had the spring garden flatbread and my boyfriend had the sweat pea and avocado toast. I was impressed at the portion sizes, but both dishes were very light. The flatbread was very thin, like a few layers of puff pastry, and had a light scattering of toppings instead of being fully covered. Both dishes were very good. For my entree, I had the seared Chilean sea bass, which was excellent. It was cooked to perfection, and the accompaniments created a great flavor profile. One disappointment for this dinner was they did not have a spring cocktail menu available. However, I ordered a wine flight and I thought the pours were generous and the selection was good. Finally, we finished our meal with dessert. I loved that the desserts were served in small cups, parfait style. It's the perfect amount to enjoy but not be too filling.

Galaxy opened up less than a month ago and we were very excited to get a chance to see a movie there. As far as movie theaters go, its pretty traditional. Reclining seats, great sound, big screens, and the smell of delicious popcorn. As an upgrade over traditional theaters, they have better food options and a good selection of beer and wine. We had a bit of everything and really enjoyed our overall experience. What makes them a exceptional was the lengths they are going through to get it right during their first month in business. Too many places don't get how important those positive customer interactions are, but Galaxy is going the extra mile.

In the end I left with a few different gummy candies and a couple chocolate bars and a rootbeer float. Price point is higher than other candy places but to be expected since they import almost all their edible goods. Service was friendly from the lady owner but it wasn't until I left and got home that I realized she forgot a couple of other gummy requests I had made.

From the bartenders to the front desk and everything in between I have enjoyed the customer service.They do need some help with the crazy long lines for check in. I have had some long waits to check in and Ive seen the lines snake pretty far down the lobby with only like 2 or 3 desk clerks. They need to have a better system going on with this. The rooms I would describe as \"ghetto chic\". Clean, somewhat modern, and trying to appear luxury but not quite making the cut. I have had stayed in the regular standard rooms as well as the suites with the jacuzzi tub and nice loungy area with couch. I will give it up for the beds they are super comfy and I sleep solid when Im here. TV is decent but channel selection needs improvement. Request a room with mountain view on the top floors cause the views are the bomb. Nice floor to ceiling windows and I just love to keep my curtains open all day and night and look at the majestic mountains. Food is good here. I have had the buffet which had a good selection of your standard buffet fare. Desserts were a treat as they have little mini versions of every dessert you can think of which makes is easy to taste test and sample all kinds of yummy. This was a nice experience compared to the horrific buffet at Boomtown ( see my Boomtown review for more details). Cafe Central has good food and is open 24hours. I also have enjoyed the Silver Baron Lounge located right under the huge mining rig. Cool place to chill and have a drink. Sips coffee bar has some yummy coffee.

The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable and I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes or so for my appointment. A year and a half ago my dog developed a Mast Cell Tumor on her side. Dr. Clarke was SO helpful and understanding and took as much time as we needed to answer questions and help us through the ordeal. She and Dr. Jeitles performed the surgery and it was a success! Unfortunately, my dog has developed a 2nd MCT. (It can be a recurring condition and is not a result of the previous tumor or the surgery.) I have total faith in the doctors at KoP Vet to successfully remove this one as well. I have also boarded my dog at KoP Veterinary Hospital. It is not a fancy pet motel of course. However, it is clean and affordable. They allowed us to bring our own food, a toy, and a blanket for her to use. Lastly, they accept Care Credit which is a credit card designed for medical (and veterinary use). This is very helpful to use, especially for more expensive procedures. Whether you need a routine check-up, boarding, or surgery for your pet, I definitely recommend King of Prussia Veterinary Hospital.","stars":4.0}

Staff was pleasant but you can tell they didn't have time for indecisiveness. Think soup nazi on Seinfeld. You need to know what you want BEFORE you get to the front of the line. Order quickly and keep it moving. No lally gaggin. Since I ate two slices of pizza (like a little piggie) I had zero room for dessert. Although I hear the cannolis are delicious. Next time I'll save room. This is a great spot with reasonable prices and I'm glad they're not close or I could see myself having a daily pizza binge.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I went to the Sidecar Bar for the first time today, and I had a pretty good experience. The server approached us immediately when we sat down to take our drink order and give us menus. I guess I came on a good day, because their tap list was really great. Included were the Bell's Cherry Stout, the Southern Tier Unearthly IPA (one of my personal favorites), Founder's Breakfast Stout (amazing), the Avery 15 (sounds better than it is, unfortunately), and the Smuttynose Smuttonator (which our waiter said was a Belgian ale, but is actually a Doppelbock). I wonder if the waiter was new, because he seemed a little all over the place. However, he did manage to get our orders correct at least. The beers, although delicious, came in tiny glasses for $6. They definitely could have been $1 or $1.50 cheaper. My turkey burger was a little on the dry side, but spicy and pretty flavorful, although it needed salt. The fries were pretty good, but I was trying to avoid them. I split cornbread with my boyfriend, and it was nowhere near as good as Good Dog's. I thought that, overall, the food was just okay. I tried the macaroni and cheese that my roommate and my boyfriend both got, and it was pretty bland. It had potential to be good, but it lacked that delicious mac-and-cheese flavor and needed salt (seems to be a running theme). The server came back often to check on things and returned quickly with refills and additional drinks. I thought the service was good, except for the misinformation about the beer (really, he should know the styles of the beers they serve). I want to give the Sidecar three-and-a-half stars overall, but because of the okay food and the pricey beer, it really doesn't deserve a four.","stars":3.0}

Some of the issues that can be changed is the way the staff take care of their jobs, as it is clear that most of the girls are not qualified to do their job correctly. In the kitchen the cook sometimes overcooks the wings and sometimes the consistency of the size of the wings is questionable, and as for the girls, they seem to forget what was ordered, and don't seem to keep A eye on the floor to pick-up on waiving hands, looking for another beer or whatever, I mean good looks are ok to look at, but I people need to be served correctly.

We had bread pudding which had a nice crunchy crust, pralines, bourbon syrup (I think), and delicious local vanilla ice cream.

{"text":"Since my original review, I have given this restaurant additional tries (in full transparency, I did receive a gift card from the owner that covered at least one). I maintain that their coffee is my favorite thing about the place - I really love their lavender honey iced latte and make a point to stop by for one when I'm in the area. Their pastries and desserts are also worth the splurge both monetarily and calorie-wise. In regards to their main menu, it really depends on the item you order and when you go. I still don't think it's worth more than a 15-20 minute wait, but they often don't have such waits on weekdays\/nights so I recommend going then if you want to give them a try. If you're on a brief trip to town, is it worth seeking out? No. Is it a good option if you're in the area already or a local looking to switch things up? Yes.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"I was staying across the street at the residents inn, where we could use the gym for free. First of all the system they have set up for the people who are staying at the hotel sucks. You have to give the front desk your id and they give you a pass. Then you hand your pass to the front desk at the gym and sign in. The first time I went there, the staff was not nice at all. I continued to go there the rest of the month and I still got the same attitude. My coworker and I decided to attend a yoga class. We asked the front desk when we came in where the class was and she pointed down the hall. There was two yoga classes going on at the same time and we were trying to figure out which one was the right class. Well Justin, one of the instructors, came out with an attitude. He asked us if we were coming in or not and told us we were late. They were still warming up and we were only two minutes late. My coworker then did not want to go in because he was an asshole. I went to this gym for a month and the staff was rude everyday and not only to me, but my other co-workers as well. The gym has uneven floors everywhere and the parking lot is small and on the side of the building and you have to walk far in the cold before you reach the entrance.

My main issue was the cheese. The consistency of it was way weird, not gooey.

{"text":"This is the drunk food that dreams are made of. Large portions of crispy fries topped off with generous portions of cheese(curds or otherwise), meats, and sauces, makes for a delicious mess of unhealthy but satisfying poutine variants. In case you don't know how it works, you walk to the counter and choose your fries topped off with some mixture of gravy and proteins, and you can choose a small($6) or large($9). Keep in mind that you're getting loaded containers of potatoes, so the larges are definitively enough to split among 2-3 people(hell, even the smalls may be enough to). After difficult deliberation(most everything sounded good), we ended up deciding on the chicken tikka masala, General Tso's, and cheesesteak poutines. All of them were delicious, but surprisingly my favorite was the tikka masala; the mixture of curds and curry gravy with a generous portion of chicken is something that I'm craving to this day. But regardless, this is a great snack to share, especially for the potato and cheese loving friends.","stars":5.0}

The breakfast was by far the best Holiday Inn Express breakfast I've ever had (we only stay at Holiday inns) and I think that's only because of the woman running the breakfast here, Bette. She was fantastic. She kept everything stocked and tidy while also coming around every 5 minutes or so to ask everyone how they were doing and if she could get anyone anything. She was amazing! She made our mornings start off on the right foot! The housekeeping manager, Bethany was awesome too! My kiddo got sick one morning (woke us up with puking) and didn't quite make it to the bathroom. After I cleaned it up there was what would be a stain. I went downstairs to ask if there was something I could use to clean up the stain and she told me not to worry about it that she would take care of it. I went to get breakfast and when I came back up, the stain was gone! She was so quick and efficient. The woman that also does the house keeping on the second floor, Jasmine was great too!

Since we arrived before our reserved time, we sat at the bar for a drink. The bartender was very pleasant and attentive. However, my biggest shock of the night came early, as the tab for 2 7oz glasses of wine were $21 (and these were the house wines)! Since this was my first visit, I was beginning to dread the price of the meals. Our table was ready on-time, and our waitress was great -- very knowledgeable of the menu and attentive. We started with an antipasto of cheeses and meats. Although good, it was extremely light for 4 people. I had the baked rigatoni which came with pepperoni and sausage. It was really good, and filling. The sauce was OK, but not bad. Others had the lobster ravioli special. Looking at their plates, I assume they loved it since there was little left over. Since we were all full, we passed on the desserts. The restaurant is very noisy, but I expected that. It is a nice environment, which will be more enjoyable when the weather improves and you can be outside. We will certainly return.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"This area has been a part of Nashville history since 1784. The courthouse bordered one aspect of the square, and the other three sides were flanked by markets and grocery and other important areas for Nashvillians. There was a ton of progress... buildings were torn down and built. The development of Public Square Park was announced in 2005. It was originally supposed to be named after former Mayor Richard H. Fulton, but the Metro City Council decided against it- in case it would be considered a gift or favor if the city of Nashville were ever in court in front of Fulton, his friends, or his opponents. It was originally proposed at $26.5 million. It was decided as a place to pump up interest in a neglected area of downtown, to create a parking garage for downtown and near Nissan Stadium, and to overlook the riverfront. The finished park includes a little over 6 acres. The park opened October 1st, 2006. It has an observation tower, marked with memorials to the people who founded the city: John Donelson and James Robertson, with maps of their paths to the city. This was the kickoff of Nashville's Bicentennial. That same year, Public Square Park became the home to the official Nashville Christmas Tree, hosting an annual lighting ceremony- which is my personal favorite park tradition. Since then, there have been a TON of events there, including Live on the Green concerts, Gay Pride Events, festivals, 5Ks, and Mayoral Inaugurations. As it sits on the foot of the courthouse, it's also been home to many political events, including protests, rallies, and vigils. Noteably, the Nashville protests in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd escalated into violence that damaged parts of the park and the courthouse. There is currently an art installation called \"Witness Walls\", wherein the artist, Walter Hood, took pictures from the Nashville Archives from the Civil Rights Movement in Nashville and memorialized it in concrete walls. It's an awe-inspiring installation, and worth the visit alone, in and of itself. It has reflecting pools, lots of benches and tables, and a large lawn. Now- the observatory. Hours say it's open daily from sunrise to sunset. I was there at 11am on a Sunday, and the observatory was padlocked up. Was it due to COVID? Winter? Homeless? Unsure. I wish it was clearer. Also, there were two different pieces of the park destroyed and shattered. It could be from the George Floyd riots from June, but the debris that still stood six months later made me doubt that. I'd love to know if this park has been neglected due to COVID budget cuts, or something different. Ultimately, though, the pros FAR outweigh the cons of this park.","stars":5.0}

She asked them why the markup was so high over the MSRP and was given a load about taxes, registration and freight charges. Really? $800 each for these? I can understand reasonable profit, but not price gouging. I believe they took advantage of her because she is a woman like so many bully businesses do. I would not buy so much as an oil filter from these thieves again. Nashville, beware, this is a dishonest business. I am contacting the Better Business Bureau and Honda of America to complain.

I swung by here while getting an oil change next door at Pennzoil. I ordered through the walk up window as my car was obviously preoccupied. Right when I walked up I was greeted by a joyful (and no-doubt, caffeinated) gal exclaiming, \"Good morning! How are you?\" To which I replied, \"Awesome, and you?\" And here's where the compliment that is so genuine it caught me off guard came into play, \"I'm great...you have very kind face!\". Never got that one before, but I'll take it! We moved past small talk and I made my order - a small almond milk late with one pump of white chocolate. SO GOOD. I usually get drinks that are similar to this one when I go to Dutch Bros. Their drinks are made on the sweeter\/more calorie dense side - so if you like your coffee to taste a little bit stronger, you oughta request less sweetener in your drink. But don't get me wrong, their drinks (as they are specified on the menu) are yummy. They are just more on the dessert side of things, in my opinion. If I am splurging, going all out and forgetting about calories - I am all for a Honey Kicker - half and half (Lord, help me), honey, Irish cream, and espresso.

Our waitress was nice and provided good service. She offered suggestions from the menu and was personable. The food was largely bland but tolerable (I've had more flavor at Carabba's). However our dinner was interrupted by a loud man at the bar. This man was dropping F-bombs left and right. When the diners in the booth next to us left I believe they commented to him on his rude behavior. They were greeted with some additional expletives. Before these people could leave the restaurant they were approached by the man's brother. They were once again cursed at and eventually physically shoved out the door (yes assaulted out of the restaurant). The actually called the police and filed a complaint while we were dining. When our waitress returned to the table I asked her why none of the restaurant workers, including management, did anything to stop this verbal and physical assault. Her reply was that the men doing the assaulting and dropping f-bombs were the owners.(basically meaning the workers were powerless to stop their bosses). I decided then and there that I would never return to this restaurant. Never in my life have I seen a restaurant owner assault a customer or display such a lack of professionalism by cursing so loudly and disrupting his patron's evenings. I've seen better behavior in a diner. The food is not worth the potential trouble you may find here. My advice is to try one of the other many excellent restaurants in center city.","stars":1.0}

However, if you are looking for something that is easy on the wallet and will transport you back to a simpler time- this is the place for you. All the waitresses seemed to have worked there for decades and begin every sentence with sweetie, honey or baby- in a completely earnest way. The food is not the best you'll ever have- it is a no frills diner, but I ate here 4 times in 4 days for breakfast, dinner and way late night after bar food and it was always good. If you want to take the night off from haute cuisine, spend it here- you'll get some great people watching as well.","stars":5.0}

Great atmosphere, very \"down-home,\" and super friendly people. And you can't beat their prices! The location is also very convenient with lots of parking available. We love it!","stars":5.0}

This is like the little place from the burbs that managed to get in on Main St. There is nothing fancy about the design which is part of the charm of this restaurant. There's only about 8 tables and a couple seats at the window. The food is pretty good. Not amazing but good. I'm pretty much happy just because they have tots. The breakfast sandwiches are also pretty good. They use Trader Joe's coffee which I like at home but I wish they had something a little better. Volo is just down the street and they provide coffee to several establishments in the area. (Awesome coffee) I like Greg's and I have brought friends here several times.

First of all, the stylist never looked at my hair until after it had already been shampooed. Second, the shampooing itself was a horrible experience -- the woman yanked my hair, slammed my head into the sink, literally scrubbed my hair between her hands until it was damaged, and then didn't even use conditioner. It went downhill from there. The stylist told me \"don't worry, I can just copy what you had before by looking at it.\" Yeah, not so much. I should have just gotten up and left when she said \"wow, your hair is so straight!\" Because my hair is actually really wavy and hard to manage -- the only reason it was straight was because she blew it out! I tried to say as much and she was like \"umm... I mean, that's not what I meant by straight...\" Ridiculous. Now I have a crappy haircut and have to wait for it to grow out.","stars":1.0}

She didn't have the necessary ID to take ownership of the car, which she found out at the last minute, and they didn't even have basic sense to hold the car until we could get it sorted. No accountability, no care for the customer, even at this basic level. In fact, they even cancelled her order to get her off the phone and refused to refund the deposit. We will never buy a Tesla, at least not in Pennsylvania. Two scientists who love these cars and what they represent, because you treated us like garbage. Unfortunately the cult of personality of Elon Musk and promise of reduced carbon footprint is meaningless when your dealership distributing and servicing the cars is terrible. The dealership cared more about getting it's money from our financing than they cared about the relationship between the car buyer and themselves.

{"text":"This place has had several different name changes through out the years from Pockets, W.C. Murphy's and currently Nineteen 19. The only thing that hasn't changed is those steps leading up to the bar, but they did remove the second floor bar from what I have seen. There used to be pool tables that used to cover the whole floor with some an awesome version of Golden Tee in the corner, hence the name \"Pockets \". The bar area is still in the same spot , not like previous (Pockets era ) when it was along the back wall closest to West Chester Pike. Little knowledge bomb for you guys, minus the people who are from the Havertown area that remembers the old Pockets. Other than the annoying steps that could kill you if you had to many cocktails this place is pretty awesome. Great change of scenerie with ample amounts of TVs for you to watch any kind of sporting event. This spot has a great selection of craft beers, great top shelf liquors for you to enjoy, I was more impressed with the HUGE frosty monster mugs they have. Every Monday they do a monster mug day, 4 dollars a fill of your favorite craft. YES PLEASE ! Besides the great crafted beers they also have a phenomenal liquor selection, the speed rack even looked like it had top shelf bottles ready to sling out. Another must try is their \"Monstrosities\" its a sweet kick with a boost of octane. Try it, you'll like it. Stefanie is an amazing bartender who is friendly, extremely patient, knows how to make a good drink. This is something that is a plus, a bartender ready to refill your thirst and remembers how you like it to be be made without asking you again. I also found out she is bartender at Barnaby's down the road, so experience and patience is something she knows and has. The kitchen looks like its been revamped , the food tastes better, mind you I have had a few of their apps in the past which were sub par, nothing that stood out there. Now thumbs up on changing it up, I'll have to try some of their other selections , but for now the ones I enjoyed were: 1) Firecracker Shrimp.. damn good tempura style with a chipolte glaze I think it was. 2) Tequila lime chicken wings.. great flavor, nice sized wings, ask for it crispy, cooked a little longer 2 thumbs up 3)Pan seared Ahi tuna... G-Damn amazing, some kind of pepper crust over top mixed with their wasabi type of dip. In all this is a great place to go relax, enjoy the food, get your drink of choice and just do it up. Also if you are looking for a happy hour spot this is a must check, 1\/2 priced apps between 5-7. Enjoy","stars":4.0}

In the morning we discovered more problems with the room and again, customer service was awful. We were given the total run-around and the management tried to blame us for the problems we encountered. We ended our trip early and went home. Even after we had gotten approval from guest services to terminate our stay a day early, we received calls later that day threatening to charge us for another night. You've got to be kidding me. A couple bright spots: the new noodle place (pho mein) is tasty and the staff there are kind and funny; the bell desk staff were great; and a member of the security team turned out to be the kindest and most compassionate person we dealt with in the hotel.

And I really can't tell what differentiates La Parrilla from any other standard, Americanized Mexican restaurant in the region. It's kitch. It's flat. It's made for tourists who have little to no concept of what Mexican food can be or should be. I mean, if you can't master the art of beans that are soft and wholesome enough to make you demand the chef hand over the recipe, what are you doing in business? It's a shame too.

We got to the front table and the hostess said they had called our name and we weren't there. We explain to them my wife had to come and get the rest of the party from the street entrance and it's a long walk. They said we have to wait again. We asked the manager and the manager told us we would have to wait again. By now there was a bigger crowd. So starting to wait again probably would have taken the half-hour, but hostesses were rude and I believe there was a racial aspect to this as they seem to be kinder to African-Americans and not so much us.

{"text":"The worst experience ever. Parents stay away. 1. Walked in numerous times at children being yelled at by teachers. 2. Terrible teacher and staff turnover. In two months most of the people who worked there quit. Including the support staff. 3. Website is fake and not updated in many years. 4. Spanish curriculum means teachers yelling Spanish at kids on the playground. 5. They don't follow any standardized curriculum. Just because the director says there is a curriculum it doesn't mean anything. If your kid ever went to school with a curriculum you would know the difference. 6. Walked in many times at kids physically pushing each other, hair pulling and teacher was completely unaware of the situation. 7. My child comes home withdrawn unlike the other school from last year, there is not much they come home with as far as learning new things or being excited about going to school. 8. The playground is too big and difficult for teachers to manage. If your kid is small I seriously would worry about their safety and on numerous occasions I was myself concerned for the little ones being together with big aggressive kids. 9. I watch teachers ignore children's bids for attention because they are too busy counting all the kids on the playground. 10. Kids are not engaged with in a meaningful way. There is a chaotic feeling and teachers seem very overwhelmed. 11. Kids watch tv and play on kindle frequently- not for educational purposes but for entertainment. I witnessed that personally. And my kid saw so many movies there as a form of babysitting. 12. Teachers are very nice but they are expected to do way too much and it's unrealistic. 13. The art projects are mostly teachers doing all of the work and not process art. Anyone who is actually an artist would know that art is about process not product. 14. Director's understanding of child development is very limited and it shows throughout the design of the entire program. Pros: Some teachers are really sweet. School is clean and they have a lot of materials and toys and books. I am so very sorry for all the parents who like myself fell into believing that their children are in good hands. I am terribly heart broken that this school is somehow rated number one because most things about it is for appearance only and a product of a good marketing campaign but not a truly educational program with a heart that follows appropriate preschool curriculum and structure.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Absolutely the most DISGUSTING food I have ever gotten from a Chinese restaurant! I ordered sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and it was like they just cut the whole chicken into strips with tendons and ligaments and dark\/white meat. I couldn't even bite through the meat! The rice had little to no flavor. I now have to go get something else for dinner. Do yourself a favor and go to Empress of China if you want chinese on the westbank (I work right next to there but they aren't open on Mondays..... and I really wanted chinese)!

{"text":"I am NOT ashamed to admit that I have now done 3 chocolate tasting parties with Kakao :) The first one was with my church. The other two were ones I scheduled with my graduate school friends. All of them were absolutely fabulous! So fabulous that I'm having my sister's bachelorette party with Kakao this coming winter. First, this business is pretty amazing. The man who started it, Brian, was sick of his previous job and decided to get into the chocolate making business. I am SO glad he did. His chocolate is AMAZING. First, there are no artificial ingredients in the chocolate he makes. Second, he's local (I love supporting local businesses!). And third, he is always thinking up new things!!!! These knew things range from chocolate peanut butter cups that have sea salt and a peanut on top to lavender truffles. You name it....he's probably tried it. I just have to say it is amazing to have a modern-day Willy Wonka making chocolate naturally! It is no surprise he has won so many awards, including several best chocolate awards in St. Louis! You can taste his chocolates either in one of his stores during business hours (he has three now) or via a chocolate tasting party. I would HIGHLY recommend the chocolate tasting party! The party lasts about 1.5 hours and starts at 7 PM (after the store closes). It is pretty cheap. You need a minimum of 8 people (maximum of 28). If you schedule Monday-Thursday, it is only $12 a person. If you schedule Friday-Saturday, it is only $15 a person. This price gets you 6 chocolates, a marshmallow pie sample, and a pates de fruit. Basically, 8 samples (along with a 90 minute presentation of chocolate) for only $12-$15. It is such a steal considering that you get the store after hours along with the undivided attention of Brian (or another associate). You are also free to BYOB!! When we went yesterday, we tasted so many good things! We tried a raspberry pates de fruit, a marshmallow pie sample, a peanut butter cup, a chai chocolate, a dark sea salt caramel chocolate, a chile truffle, and 2 others I'm blanking on. All of them were delicious! Their biggest seller is the sea salt caramel, which is fabulous. I would also highly recommend trying a pates de fruit or the peanut butter cup. I've also tried their chai hot chocolate, which is also good. In sum, you just can't go wrong! If you couldn't tell already, this place is amazing!!!! Check it out as soon as you can and definitely book your chocolate tasting party ASAP!!!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I really enjoyed my first experience floating, and I'm glad I came here. When you check in, the employee will show you around and explain things thoroughly, if you've never been before. The room contains one float tub, as well as a shower area. I'd start with the ear plugs. They offer two separate types of plus, foam and wax. I highly recommend the wax, and I also recommend putting it in first, before the shower, so you can make sure that it's in there well. You want to shower before you get in the tub, making sure that you dispose of all the oils on your skin. They provide the shampoo, conditioner, and soap, as well as towels. Make sure that you shower quickly, because as soon as the jet turns off in your tub, your time starts. Make sure to turn the room light off before stepping into your tub. In the tub, you have a spray bottle of water, a neck pillow, and a small towel. You have the option of laying in total darkness, or with a soft light inside the pod. I did the total darkness, and enjoyed it, thought I did turn it on in the middle of the session because I got salt in my eyes. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR FACE in the pod. You'll want to steady yourself in the tub and be as still as possible. I ended up using the head pillow, and also leaving my hair down. It took me a while to relax enough, I could only hear my breathing and heartbeat. My breathing was off because I had recently been sick, so it took a while for me to be able to quiet my breathing. I ended up falling asleep quickly, and before I knew it, my light was on and my session was over. You have as much time as you need to shower and wash all of the soap off. They have plenty of things you could want... q-tips, towels, etc. The staff was very pleasant to work with, and were super friendly. I thoroughly enjoyed my time, and will definitely be back.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"%95 of the food was good here. And this is a buffet with plenty variety. The atmosphere was comfortable FOR ME. There were tons of senior citizens and the lady behind me in line(before the buffet. waiting to pay) joked and said \"look you're the only young one here!\" but everyone was real nice and the waiter kept my table clean fast. The food is constantly being refilled BEFORE it's gone. So everything was fresh and no entree's were empty. All the food was delicious and made me want more but I kept switching it up to give me a chance to try more variety. You gotta try the sliders, they were awesome had some with fries and onion rings, I almost feel like going back and just eating those until they're all gone haha. The beef is constantly being cooked and sandwiched so they're always juicy and hot off the grill with melting cheese and warm bread. I had some BBQ chicken which was just great, again fresh food makes a big difference, not like some buffets were the food tastes like it was popped out of a microwave, here it tasted like it was just cooked a minute ago, the same feeling you get at a barbecue party. The bread bar they have has a delicious variety of warn soft dinner rolls and biscuits with cheese. It's just awesome getting hungry just remembering it! The only thing I didn't like was the meat loaf, it was just a slab of greasy beef with no flavor and was my only disappointment. I also got the feeling that it was the oldest item at the buffet. I was ready to give this restaurant 5 stars until I ate this taste-less meat. :( I did not try any salad or dessert but the actual dishes of meat, potatoes, fries, burger sliders and chicken were very tasty!! Will go back for the price!","stars":4.0}

We stood at the door for 5-6 minutes awkwardly waiting and no one ever came back to let us know how long the wait would be or anything. We left, confused and kind of upset. We have been here several times for dinner but have never tried the brunch, so we were excited to try it. We would come back to try again, but I would probably call first next time.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"Amazing burgers! Where to begin? We started out with the Tuscan Dip. It was sort of like a salty hummus. We enjoyed it, but it probably wasn't worth $9. Also, I found an olive pit in the dip only after I started eating it and felt something strangely hard in my mouth. Frankly, I was relieved to discover it was just an olive pit! I was happy to learn that you can substitute a veggie burger for any of the various burgers on the menu. You can also substitute a lamb burger or chicken. I picked the Mexicali BBQ burger with a veggie burger. It came with queso, roasted jalapeno chilis, guacamole, fried onion, and barbeque sauce. I'm thinking 'How can all these wonderful things fit on one burger?' Oh but they can. I don't know how they do it but the burger arrived topped high. I cut it in half and dug in. Somehow they assembled it so that the whole thing pretty much stuck together. The veggie burger broke apart a little and escaped but that is pretty typical for a veggie burger. It was so amazing that words cannot describe. Just wow. I also added onion rings as a side. I totally did not need to add the onion rings considering how much other food we had. The onion rings were thickly breaded and a little greasy. Delicious. The homemade ketchup is good but sweeter than you may be used to from a Heinz bottle. Our server was also very good. Attentive without being overbearing. Bru Burger kicks butt!","stars":5.0}

They did have a bunch of mobile orders and I said I'd wait no rush what so ever as I wasn't on a time crunch for me to be anywhere so I stepped off to the side to wait They served 2 other walk in's before me. Again not a problem with that.

The thing about gyros is that in most places the meat is the same, coming from one of the big meat companies that specializes in the product.

They have an online ordering system where you can set the time you want to come and pick it up which was a plus. The pizzas are huge we got a 20' for two people it has 8 slices but the slices are the size of your head no joke. This really comes close to traditional New York pizza and the best that I have had so far. There are so many different specialty pizzas to choose from it was hard to decide. It was a plus that they let us get half supreme and half Bianca with chicken that way we didn't have to choose :-) they just charge you for the more expensive one which is fair. Many other places probably wouldn't even do that. The only thing was their dessert area looked skimp I wanted a cannoli but they didn't look appealing. I would definitely come back to try other pizza specialties. The chicken Parmesan and lasagna are on my list.","stars":4.0}

She also cut the cuticle on one of my fingers and dropped the nail polish brush, luckily it didn't fall on my pants or shoes. She didn't do a very good job shaping my nails and skipped steps like running the tool under the nail to get dead skin out.

The portions were very reasonable and satisfying. Although the desserts looked very tempting, we finished with (just) espresso. The bill came to a very reasonable $65 for two people. Note, La Viola is a byob, a feature I find very appealing.

We arrived at 2:50 & the hostess seemed very hesitant to seat us, making sure we understood that Happy Hour didn't start until 3. We were not in a huge rush, so waiting 10 minutes to order was just fine with us. After we were seated, who I assume is the manager came over & also reminded us that Happy Hour didn't start until 3 pm (by this time it was 2:55). I asked if we could give them our order & if they could put it in at 3....he said the food might take a little longer because they are switching over the kitchen, he quoted us 20 minutes. I have worked in food service before & I understand the change over, so we agreed 20 minutes was no problem. We ordered a flatbread pizza & the Tuna TarTar. We did not get our food until 3:50- 50 minutes for 2 appetizers!? Because we were on vacation, we were still in great moods & I kept expecting the waitress to at least apologize for the delay-but that didn't happen. Maybe she was having a bad day..but she was cold and seemed very unhappy. She never asked if she could get anything for us, asked how we were enjoying our food, etc.. The Terra chips that come with the Tuna were super stale, so I asked for new ones- she never acknowledged the fact that they were stale, just set the new ones down without saying a word. The food was ok & what other people around us had ordered off the lunch menu looks amazing! Even though the service was terrible (aside from the nice bus boy who fixed our umbrella & the manager), we considered stopping in on Monday for lunch because the food the previous day looked so good. Unfortunately, even though the menu in the window that lists specials notes the Monday specials.....they were not open & there was nothing posted on the door regarding why.....All in All, I may be back to try the lunch and\/or dinner menu- but really hope they step up their game on the service side!","stars":2.0}

My husband craves their Crispy Bird. While the menu has been hit or miss for me, that is not a reflection on their quality as I have various self-inflicted limitations. When they have options of interest they are typically 4-5 stars. This last time there were three options of interest and I chose the Falafel Burger, no sides.

{"text":"This may be harsh, but this is just my opinion... I think Finch and Fork could be overrated. Technically, it is with the aggregate 4 stars on Yelp against my 3. My wife and I did their rooftop wine tasting (which I'm not including in this review), then we jumped downstairs for dinner in the restaurant. They started us with complementary pickled vegetables, which I loved. Carrots, zucchini, and cauliflower, if I remember correctly. Great start - different, which I enjoyed. We kept it easy for the evening and ordered a glass of wine each. Note: the bar (either just that evening or it could be any evening) poured short. I don't think they hit the 6 oz and they certainly were short against the glass. If I had to guess, they poured about 4\/4.5 oz. To start, we ordered their fries. Holy hell they were good. They were smoky and intense with rosemary. It was great. It was an ample amount of rosemary, although I'm sure someone would think it was too much. I didn't think so. Strangely, their ketchup wasn't house-made and their lemon garlic aioli (another side condiment to the fries) was \"okay\" in my opinion - nothing that makes your REALLY want a second bite. My wife ordered the roasted tomato soup and I ordered the trout. She wasn't too hungry and it was a good-sized serving. Her soup was delicious - I kept stealing more bites from her. Haha. The soup was fantastic, practically pristine. The ricotta sprinkled into the soup was a perfect compliment to the smoky and strong taste of the roasted tomato and kale pur\u00e9e. The kale pur\u00e9e was a surprise and a great addition. It was thick and delicious. It looked just as delicious as it was. The trout. Not so great. The spaetzle was dull and bland, but it was nice that it didn't take away from the trout. The fried, flaky kale and saut\u00e9ed spinach that topped the dish were a great addition to compliment the trout. The only problem was the trout - it didn't seem like there was anything special, but I feel like there should've been something special. It's an entree and there are only a few entrees. I enjoyed the ambience and environment - a rustic, trading post feel with repurposed glasses and strong, sturdy plateware and cutlery. Lighting was excellent. The table was slightly low while the seats sats slightly high, making it perfect for discussion. I may be a little harsh on the rating, maybe it deserves 4 stars. Now, that I look back at the review, it looks like the short wine pouring and the trout were the only disappointments of the evening. I guess all in all, I would recommend Finch and Fork, just not the trout.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I came here with my family so that we could spend the day in Santa Barbara and this was the only place in the area that had two beds and didn't cost upwards of $700 for the night. I should have thought this through since it is very close to the start of the school year and there are probably plenty of families looking for rooms this weekend. Pros: The room was mostly clean (aside from a few ants, which no one is SoCal is immune to during the summer), the bed was reasonably comfy, the toiletries were very good. The record player is kinda cool, and the room comes with a mini fridge. The front desk was nice, they even offered a package of s'mores for my daughter. The decor is nice but feels extremely forced in some places. I don't really drink so can't comment on the bar but it looked like a good place to relax. Cons: This is definitely a motel masquerading as a hotel. It feels like a hipster speakeasy and a coconut tree had a baby and made this motel. It is reasonably priced (although close to $400 for the night) because you shouldn't expect hotel luxury, and the exterior of the buildings needs attention. The rooms are chocked full of liquor, drinks, and snacks that you will never use. I brought my mother in law and my 4yo daughter so having this much alcohol in the room is not an amenity. Also why does there need to be that much stuff crammed into the mini fridge? We had to remove everything just to place some leftovers in it. The shower was clean but the water pressure was low. There is no hot tub, which is a real bummer. Lastly, I should not expect to have a package of lube and condoms on display next to the wine and whiskey, especially with a child in the room. Some things are better left to the discretion of the occupants. If you want to save some money just go with the Best Western or Courtyard Marriott or just spend the extra $200 and stay at an actual hotel, I definitely will.","stars":2.0}

But it was only ten. Husband and I got a table - a sticky icky table that was still wet from being wiped down. We had a rough night and were in need of coffee. Husband said it reminded him of Army coffee - strong and nasty - like it was filtered through a dirty old sock.

The latest time, on New Year's Eve, I decided to change up my normal 'mild' wings and went with a spicy honey mustard. WINNER! I am now sold on these wings. Buffalo Wild Wings' mild sauce holds a special place in my heart, but all of the other flavors I've tried from Wings, Etc. beat them out. The location is in a strip mall and the inside isn't anything fancy. It's even a little dingy, but that's OK. For wings I just need some water served and some wet wipes to wipe my fingers when I'm done! Ok... now I'm hungry and want some wings.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"For a first time visit, I definitely want to go back again. The place is a very festive and cute - currently, during the holiday season at least. When my friend and I visited they were out of their burgers but we weren't mad, just mean that the burgers are probably good and I have to go back. Instead we ordered a mac and cheese, buffalo wings, chick phillay sandwich and 2 milkshake. Mine was the cereal killa, which was delicious! And my friend got the seasonal ugly sweater which is an eggnog base milkshake and she loved it. My take on the food is that, it is good but not to die for. My favorite of the night was the buffalo wings -- the kick on those wings were perfect for me but made my friend's mouth burn. The chick Phillay was good as well but it is not a chick-fil-a sandwich and the mac and cheese was not bad but I felt that it needed more cheese. The best part of the experience had to be the service. All of them had so much patience with us. We originally wanted to sit outside, which we did but then it got too cold and the waiter had to help us move inside. Once we were inside the service continued to keep on being awesome. I believe we had Leene (I can't remember exactly, will try to find the receipt and update later if wrong) as our main server at the end; she was amazing, very attentive from start to finish. She gave us not only great service but also great advice. Overall, I would go back.

{"text":"My first and maybe last time at Firecracker Pizza & Beer. Tonight was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in Saint Louis for a long time. My friends and I went here for dinner and it wasn't too busy. There were a good amount of empty spots for people that called in for a large party and some two-top tables that were open. Upon walking in, we were not greeted by anyone. I think it was a cook that noticed that we were just like lost and confused so we were finally helped with seating. We ended up sitting near the pizza cooks\/ovens. It took around 10 minutes for us to be greeted and even get menus, which was strange because it was not busy. Since the cooks were right there, we asked him for recommendations because the server kind of left us for a long time after dropping the menus off. Luckily we had some good suggestions on pizza from him. Our dinner order was a pizza flight consisting of the: No Sleep 'Till Brooklyn, One Bad Apple, and the Spuds Rodriguez. All the pizzas parts had good flavor but my favorite was the Brooklyn portion, the sauerkruat made the slices very distinct from any pizza I've ever tasted- though it did lack a thousand island dressing taste, it was clearly the orange drizzle on the top. The apple portion of the pizza just tasted like half a dessert pizza and the Spud Rodriguez was basically a fully loaded baked potato but in pizza form. All three parts were flavorful and worth the price. The issue I had with this place was the service, or rather specifically the server we had. I would rate the food alone to be 3-4 and the server we had 1. Our drinks sat empty for way too long. We would go 20 minutes or more without the server checking on us at a time, there was even a point that my friend took a phone call-- Using the phone call's time stamp we noticed it was at least 23 minutes since we have been checked on. As I am starting this draft for the review it is 8:53pm and the phone call was around 8:30pm. After we finished the pizza my friend ordered the Holy Mole cookie dessert. The cookie actually was finished and sat on the rack for 10-15mins before it was delivered to us. Since we were sitting right there we noticed that it was clearly the cookie ordered. The server then appeared with the checks after being gone for too long of a time. The funny part was when we finally got our checks my friend asked for the cookie and the server admitted to forgetting about it. I ended up putting my card down and looked for where the server went, she was watching tv! It took so long for the server to grab the checkbook - a person in my party went to the restroom and then came back, saw it was still there and brought it to","stars":2.0}

{"text":"My husband and I just happened to be walking past the store and wandered inside to see a crowd of people. Everyone was pulling items off the shelves, the line was long. None of the other stores we entered were nearly as crowded. We had to find out why. We heard several people exclaim how great the class was. Puzzled, we wanted to know more about \"this class.\" An employee in the store filled us in, said the crowd has just participated in a NOLA cooking demonstration. He said they offered two classes, a demonstration or a hands on class. He said the next class would begin in about two hours. We were sold, we signed up for the class. We were the last two to get in the class. Chef Gumbo Marie prepared the food, which consisted of chicken etoufee, gumbo and pralines. She was very knowledgeable and gave background history of New Orlean's food history, spices, culture and techniques of preparing creole food. She spoke of her personal heritage and her family's connection to New Orleans. She was upbeat and kept us engaged. She answered all of our questions. The gumbo was absolutely delicious! The chicken etouffee was good, just needed a little more seasonings. Chef Marie directed us to the center of the table. She wanted us to try the various seasonings located in the lazy Susan. I added some cajun power garlic sauce and a little hot sauce. That really added additional flavor to the dish. The pralines were very good and appeared to be quite easy to make. After class, we purchased a gift set, which included a cookbook with three additional seasonings. I also purchased the crab, shrimp and crawfish bowl sauce, the dehydrated garlic chips and the cajun power garlic sauce. I hope to use these spices when I return home to make an authentic NOLA meal for my family. I am so happy we stumbled into this store, it was the highlight of our vacation. I strongly encourage all to stop in and either take the hands on class or sit in and watch the demonstration, you will not be disappointed.","stars":5.0}

We chose the bar, because you can get more happy hour deals sitting at the bar. Our server was really nice and helped us with any questions we had. After hearing about the happy hour deals, we ordered the Cheesy Break Sticks, Felix Meatballs, Half King Creole and Half Thunderbird Deep Dish Pizza, and Half Don Flamenco and Half Mr. Hughes Louisiana Thin Pizza. While we waited for our food, we took advantage of the Schooner beer deal and had a great time! The Felix and Cheesy Bread Sticks came out and I knew they were delicious when I set my eyes on them. My group really enjoyed them, and we couldn't wait to try out the pizza. The Louisiana thin pizza was baked on a metal plate, while the deep dish was baked in a pan for a crustier pizza. The King Creole Pizza was made with alfredo sauce, shrimp and tomato basil relish, my friends' first impression was it tasted like shrimp alfredo on pizza. Not a bad thing, I love shrimp alfredo! The Thunderbird had roasted chicken, ham, bacon, onions and topped with a special aioli. It had loads of flavor and my group loved the combination of ingredients! The other two, Mr. Hughes and Don Flamenco were both decent choices for my group. We enjoyed our deep-dish choices a lot more. Overall, great pizza place with an awesome happy hour!

The Americana (?) is just basically pepperoni pizza. It came out in less than 7 minutes but it was perfection. The crust was the right thickness not doughy or or too much sauce. The only thing that was off was it was hot just not piping like fresh out of the oven. But I have no complaints about the food or my server. The decor is wood paneling walls and exposed beams, a nice above ground basement vibe. The pizza was good the restaurant clean and organized but slightly expensive for a personal size pizza.

Was a little disappointing that it only came with a choice of potatoe and no veggies or salad for $28.95. I wanted green beans so I got a side and had to spend another $5.95. It was a decent size portion but a smaller one included with the steak would have been nice. I got fries with mine. They were home made and you could tell they were fresh.

{"text":"Run, don't walk to another mortgage broker! We went to Ryan Kelly to consolidate our first and second mortgage and get a lower interest rate. His option added 10k more than what we owed on our loan due to PMI (and associated fees). We asked about a different type of loan that others were offering for a similar interest rate. The rate he quoted on that type of a loan went up a full percentage point. We obviously didn't want either of those crappy deals and were informed that if we didn't take them, we would be charged $417 for the appraisal (something we didn't know ahead of time). Needless to say, we didn't take the deal, went with another broker who got us the lower interest rate without adding 10k on to our debt.

I called to book the move, and was told the movers would be there between 8:30 am - 9:30 am. My \"pre-move letter\" that was emailed to me also had this time. So, at 9:40 am on the day of the move, I called the office to confirm movers were still coming. I was then told that they don't arrive in my city until 9:00 am - 10:00 am. I questioned him on being told the wrong times and having the wrong time on the paperwork, and his response was \"Yeah, they need to change that.\" 10:15 am, and the movers arrived. They took a look at everything in our 3 bedroom apartment, and the few things we had left in our outdoor storage unit, then began loading the truck. When they started wrapping our dining room table, they simply lifted the top off and laid it on a blanket, then started to wrap it. We told them that the top of the table needed a blanket over it as well since the majority of it was exposed, and they told us they would just wrap it with plastic wrap and it would be fine. A couple of hours in, they randomly left to drive down to the storage unit to load that stuff. This wouldn't have been a problem if they hadn't left our furniture and boxes all over the front of the unit lawn and in the hallway. I came down the stairs just in time to catch a box from falling off a chair that was blocking the hallway as someone tried to walk past it. I ended up sitting in the summer noontime sun (while pregnant) for about an hour to make sure our stuff wasn't stolen, pushed over, or peed on by a dog. In the assortment of furniture was the top of the dining room table, with the exposed top leaning against a stone pillar. When they got back, the truck was full. One of the guys said, \"Yeah, I didn't realized you had so much stuff, otherwise I would have packed the truck higher.\" So then, they ended up putting stuff in our personal vehicles for us to drive over to the new house. One of the guys went to throw a dining room chair in the back of my personal truck, and I had to yell at him to stop because the chair needed to be covered to prevent the Rhino-liner from scratching it up. Once we arrived, and everything was unloaded, we did a quick inspection to make sure everything looked ok. Not surprisingly, we discovered the top of the dining room table had deep scratches in it. When we pointed it out, they asked if we wanted to fill out a damage report, to which we obviously said yes. The damage report for the table","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I've been to this location on numerous occasions, but I felt like my final visit there warranted a review. I first stopped by last week, and to my dismay, the late night hours have changed. The restaurant now closes at 1AM instead of 2AM, so my friend and I had to find another place for our late night meal. I was finally able to visit again tonight, which I now regret. We ordered our food and two out of five dishes came out promptly. We sat there waiting another 25+ minutes before the rest of our food came out. The server informed us that they were short staffed and only one kitchen worker was making the food. Thank goodness there was only one other table, or else we would have been waiting a lot longer. I also witnessed another server handing a dish I ordered to someone from a table she was serving. I know it was my dish because I overheard her explaining that this wasn't what they ordered, but that they should try it anyway, and if they didn't like it she would bring them something new. I'm not sure why she didn't just go back in the kitchen and recheck the ticket for the correct table. This usually wouldn't upset me; people make mistakes, and I get that. But when you've been waiting for almost half an hour for the second half of your meal, it got a bit frustrating. The food has definitely changed for the worse. The sushi rice was mushy. The ramen broth was bland. The tuna tartar was flavorless. The takoyaki was missing most of the octopus. The only reason I gave a second star was because the servers were really nice. The other server came to our table and apologized for her mistake, and our server offered to take our drinks off the bill.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"The name \"Easy Smog\" is misleading because this was definitely not an easy process. My friend and I got here at around 2:30 pm on a Friday and asked how long the smog check would take and was told 20 minutes. So we walked to a nearby coffee shop and returned at 3 pm. Due to recent work my car had done, the memory had been cleared so it did not pass the smog check. He told us to come back after driving it for 20 mins and he charged me to plug it in to a device to check if it would the second time! He said it wouldn't so to go back on Monday but at this point I had already paid 3x more than his competitors charge!! I ended up leaving this place at around 5:30 pm so wasted 3 hours at this place for nothing. I did not go back and took my car to a different shop which charged a fraction of what Easy Smog charged me for the original smog check. Also, when I asked the technician for an itemized receipt he told me the receipt he provided (a hand written receipt) was the only one he could provide. So I asked him to explain the breakdown and he did but in a very condescending way. Customer service is lacking. I would advise to stay away from this place.","stars":1.0}

Home of our friend Mary Wyss! We were at a party Friday night to kick off Labor Day Weekend at our friend Faye's beautiful home and met two of her friends there - one of them went to Parkway Central - Class of 1981 - Steve Goldberg. He was telling us about Frank and Helen's Pizzeria in University City not far from their home. Once someone tells me about a great place to eat that I have not been . . . I cannot remove it from my brain. Decided to try the Frank's pizza - with 11 ingredients - but I opted to have the anchovies and black olives removed from the pizza pie. Truly delicious - the place is a retro throw-back to the 1950s but well worth your time to go and get their pizza - because . . . I love pizza and this pizza was about as good as I've had in quite a while. So when you are wanting a throw-back environment in University City and delicious pizza on top of your dining experience, please head over to Frank & Helen's Pizzeria. You will NOT be disappointed!

{"text":"REPLACEMENT REVIEW: \"We rented a property from Wolverton & Co and have had mixed experiences with them. When we initially moved into the home, we found the property in unacceptable condition. The house was not cleaned to our expectations and we had to get the cleaners back multiple times before the house was acceptable. This was something that should have been dealt with properly prior to us moving in. There is no excuse. During our tenancy there were several items which needed attention. These items were generally dealt with in a timely and professional manner. Due to work reasons we needed to relocate and terminate the lease early. We had some ups and downs with this process of terminating the lease, primarily communication issues between multiple contacts at Wolverton. We ultimately were able to terminate the lease early without any penalty and received prorated rent and the security deposit back as promised.\"","stars":1.0}

{"text":"My first experience with Kermit's was last week, and it was not nearly as rave-worthy as I expected. I wasn't feeling well so I ordered the chicken spaetzle soup, which comes with mustard bread. At home, I discovered absolutely no chicken in the soup and the spaetzle-like remnants were sparse. The soup mostly consisted of broth and some slighly crunchy carrot and celery pieces. The broth was salty and had a heavy rye taste. Not really my thing but it did have a lot of flavor. The bread was easily the best part of the meal. So not really off to a great start. A few nights later, I came home to discover half of Kermit's sausage and peppers pizza on the counter. I had half a slice at room temp and thought it was pretty good. The next day, I heated some up for lunch and was really impressed. The spicy peppers were really awesome and the caramelized onions gave a hint of sweetness. Things were looking up. Last night we ordered a selection of things to try. I had some of the antipasta salad, which was delicious, although the dressing was not. I ended up using some of my own from the fridge. The salad's ingredients were all sliced and scattered over the lettuce. I loved the slivers of pepperoncini and artichokes. I had half a slice of the BBQ pizza just to taste, and it was absolutely delish. This morning, I had a chunk of the salted caramel brownie with my coffee. Heaven! Based on my experiences so far, there are things that Kermit's does really, really well, and others that need some fine tuning. I'm happy to test out the waters, and I'm very happy to have them right in my neighborhood.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Visited BW3s on Pendleton Pike on 5\/4\/18 for an early dinner.... the restaurant was not crowded at the time with a few families dining with more coming as I dined. Generally the restaurant is pretty dark.... but that's to be expected since most folks come here to watch sports on the plentiful TVs throughout the venue. Well I was here to have some wings.... boneless wings at that! Everything on BW3s is \"ala carte\"... with only specials here and there offering combos. Today, there were no specials running for their boneless wings during the dinner time... so i had to order from the ala carte menu. A snack boneless wing order of 7 pieces was $8.49 and the \"small\" boneless wing order of 10 pieces was $10.49. You can't try multiple sauces on the snack size so I opted for the small order so that I could try 2 different sauces. I got the Honey BBQ and the Parmesan Garlic sauces split between the order. BW3 wings are very meaty for the most part with most of the boneless chunks being larger than your standard \"chicken nugget\". They offer dry rubs as well but I opted for sauce which was plentiful on each wing. Very yummy sauces indeed.... Overall, the wing quality at BW3s is good...they are meaty and have a decent meat to breading ratio, with enough sauce to cover but not be drowned in it. They also give you a side dip of ranch or Blue Cheese included... The only downside is that they really don't have many combo specials outside of the lunch menu....so expect to pay a bit more for a full meal with sides and a drink. Still it is a quality experience if you are really wanting some boneless wings.","stars":4.0}

The woodfired Grill was constantly going with charbroiled oysters and the like. I had the rabbit dumplings which was actually better than I expected. For dessert I had the blueberry pie pan with ice cream which is also excellent. At first, it appeared that the portions were small. However, I was full in the end. Next time I will definitely have the oysters the ribs and the mac & cheese all of which looked absolutely phenomenal coming off the grill.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"This was a great way to try a staple dish at some of the hot spots in the French Quarter. I pre-ordered tickets on their web site ($48\/each). The tour lasts about 2 hours, as advertised. If your experience is anything like mine, you'll stop at Antoine's for gumbo, Tujague's for turtle soup, Arnaud's for shrimp Arnaud, and Creole Delicacies for pralines. Pay particular attention to the spiel on Antoine's. This place has a lot of history. According to the staff there, it's also commonly frequented by Tom Cruise and his unnecessary posse of bodyguards due to his paranoia, as well as Branjelina, who are respectively in need of a bath and change of clothes, and some rehab. Overall, the guide (whose name escapes me) was very knowledgeable and kept our group engaged the whole time, unlike other guides who ramble on and on and put the crowd to sleep. You're not going to leave here full, but it'll help you make an informed decision of where you feel like eating, especially if you're only in town for a short time.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"One of the most amazing experiences of my adult life was had at Candlelight Lounge, on an otherwise ordinary Wednesday night, dancing and singing with Lionel Batiste and the Treme Brass Band. The night prior, I had gone with some NOLA natives to the Maple Leaf Bar to see The Rebirth Brass band, the group made famous by the HBO show, \"Treme.\" While fun, the crowd was mostly college-aged, drunk, and obnoxious. Obviously I'm no expert, but there didn't seem to be much real New Orleans spirit in that room. It just felt like a good second line band playing at a rowdy college bar. The next night, my last in New Orleans, I decided to check Candlelight, which I was told was legendary, and would serve up a more 'authentic NOLA' experience. I didn't really know what that meant, and probably still don't. What I do know is that my night @ Candlelight was filled with more love and spirit than I had experienced in a long time. The crowd was diverse - 18 yr olds to 98 yr olds, hipster transplants to NOLA legends. The band played for what had to have been 4 hrs, with breaks in between for eating, chatting and drinking with the audience. Lionel Batiste ( who comes every Wed to play with the band and dance with the ladies, entertained the crowd the entire night - sashaying around, looking dapper, being awesome. I'll never forget the moment I shared with him, dancing hand in hand, he, for some reason, w\/ a child's parasol, which he was twirling in the air so casually - like a cooler, subtler Fred Astaire. If you have one night in NOLA - go here. If you have two nights, go here twice. I don't know if the other weekdays are as lively - but Wed is a sure bet. Dance with Lionel.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"In my opinion there are way too many people looking for the \"spa-gym\" experience these days - tanning beds, wheat grass shots, and eucalyptus scented towels to wipe their single bead of sweat on. Thankfully, LA Fitness is not one of these places. It's clean, has up-to-date equipment, and has pretty decent locker rooms. It is a huge space, but I do have some gripes about how they use it. I think about 60% of their serious lifters use the free weights, but the machines take up 5 times the amount of space in the facility. As a result, the free weight section gets packed very quickly (especially during peak hours). I never really use the cardio equipment, but the upstairs treadmill area is always pretty crowded. People complain about the machine maintenance, but if you think about those things take a POUNDING 8 hours a day 7 days a week so they are going to get a little beat up. I've never seen any issues with the resistance equipment going unfixed after a day or two. The basketball court is a plus, I usually shoot around a bit to warm-up and never really have trouble getting a ball or waiting. The only downside is that the wall is extremely close to the sidelines so it feels a little cramped around the edges. They could use a few new basketballs as well. I never had a problem with the sales process, I actually thought they were professional without being too aggressive. I checked out three competing gyms and ended up selecting LA fitness due to their size and availability of classes for my wife. After I signed up, I never heard another word about buying training services or anything similar. Overall, this gym is not perfect but gets the job done and meets my needs.","stars":3.0}

Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating with nicely appointed decor. This was my first time at this franchise. I was pleased with the quality and amount of food. It was well prepared for a take out order. But the customer service is where this place needs to step it up. A couple items for improvement...it was mid-afternoon when I visited. There were several tables that were dirty and hadn't been cleaned. Since no one else was there I wondered why someone didn't take the time to clean\/straighten a little. Especially important when we have heightened cleanliness expectations. Also there was 1 main worker plus 2 management looking staff behind the counter. I don't know about you, but management should ALWAYS greet customers as a model of behavior...not just leave that to the service employees. The person who took my order also prepared my food. Another customer walked in and had to wait about 5 minutes while my order was being prepared. Again staff didn't acknowledge him or anything. I think those are the little things that go a long way. Or again, management pitches in when the other employees have their hands full. I'd eat here again, hoping that they can have service that meets the quality of their food.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"We've been to this location a couple of times in the past. We haven't been back because the traffic in this area is horrendous. I was reminded of that last Friday when we decided to have dinner there. Anyway, the service started out very good. We received our salad and bread sticks. This is truly the only reason worth coming here in my opinion. I absolutely love their salad dressing! So we decided to get their make your own pasta bowl. We selected the angel hair pasta with the five cheese marinara sauce and shrimp as the meat topping. I should have asked for more parmesan cheese on my pasta bowl. It was basically tasteless. I remember the sauce being more flavorful than that, but maybe it was the ratio of sauce and angel hair pasta that made it this way. I feel like there should have been more sauce, and definitely a ton of cheese to give it more of a flavor. The sauce had no acidity whatsoever. The shrimp were those little (previously frozen) bay shrimp that looked like they had been boiled. There was no grilling or searing of any nature. It was just your average pasta dish that you would make at home for yourself (with little to no effort). Things got worse when a party of 12 were seated near us. Our server became non-existent about that time. It's a lot to handle all at once, and I get that. We didn't get our caf\u00e9 lattes until asking for it again. It finally came out, but it was delivered by a different server who was helping out. That would have all been fine, but they forgot the spoons. She said she would be back, but she never returned. So, we used our table knives to stir the coffee after adding sugar. I should have remembered that this is a very busy location. With that said, I think the only time I've ever had a good experience at Olive Garden is when getting the soup and salad combo meal. I think I'll stick to that when I'm in the mood for it next time. This is the place to go to for your average Americanized Italian classics. Seriously folks, there are better Italian restaurants in the area. I'd rather pay the extra price for good Italian food.

I was a pain in the butt asking for more of this, extra that, and Josh never blinked an eye! He was there consistently for anything I needed or any questions I had! He was constantly busy doing something. He is a very valuable employee. So I order some food to go and a box for my leftovers, and as I'm putting them in the box I knock over my full glass of soda, knocking over a few other things in the process. In The process I yelled \"shit\" with a family sitting close by. Again Josh never blinked an eye! With a mop and a bunch of rags and towels he began to clean my huge mess. He never made me feel bad or gave off the impression he was irritated! At that moment another employee Kyler walked in for his shift, seen what was happening and jumped right in to help! Again with a smile, he kept telling me \"no worries, don't even worry about it, we got it\" and they both continued to treat me very nice, friendly, and with respect.

Then, when my husband went to go find out what his problem was, he told my husband that the police and myself are crazy liars and shouldn't be believed (even though I have him on video and the dispatcher has him recorded from my call to make the report). 1st room (402) smelled like it was a litter box for quite some time, door locks don't work most of the time, outlets don't work, BLACK MOLD!!!, everything is disgustingly dirty. 2nd room (302) smells of mold so badly they thought putting an air freshener in the incredibly dirty A\/C would cover it (not even close). I uploaded 38 pictures of just the problems in the 2nd room. While I was in the office I also saw a mouse run out from under the couch near where they keep the food for guests to eat!!! You can imagine how upset we are that they are charging us over $100 a night for this poor excuse of a room, but also that they think it is quite acceptable to treat the guest (which he said he didn't care about what the guest has to say) so beyond horribly that I actually have to write this out. I have never had a more disgusting experience in my entire life. Save yourselves from all this trouble and DO NOT STAY AT UNIVERSITY INN!!!!!!!","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I moved my mother into the EVO apartments last June - she's 88 years old and most of the tenants are in their 20's-30's. It was her choice, she'd rather be around young people than in a retirement community, but it's still not ideal. However, the staff there, especially Nicholas, watches out for my mom, bringing packages to her door since the walk to the mailboxes is too far for her to walk, and just keeping an eye on her. The apartment is big and beautiful, well appointed and filled with light. When I visit I can use their wonderful gym and the pool. Since I take care of the administrative things for my mom, EVO is amazing at sending email updates and alerts for when things need to be signed, parking tags need to be swapped, or any issues with the building. It's a well oiled machine. I highly recommend EVO for anyone looking for a great apartment in a central neighborhood.","stars":5.0}

Not long after, we were brought a dip and my fianc\u00e9 immediately started feeling ill. When we asked, the waiter said that it contained peanuts. We informed them for the second time of his allergy. About 10 minutes later they put a plate of lamb chops with a cashew sauce in front of him. They were completely unconcerned about the severity of the situation and still charged us for a meal we could not. Will never be going back. They picked the wrong individuals to try this with, doctors and nurses.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"This is our local hangout and we enjoy the company of the owners, Karen and Gary. They have a good wine selection (100 wines under $25, hence the name), a cocktail menu and a small food menu. If you are looking for more substantial food, you can order and have it delivered there. They also have the best wine club. For $35 (plus tax) per month, you receive 2 bottles of wine and when you pick up your wine, you receive a free glass of wine or a cocktail. It's a fantastic deal! They also have free wine tastings which generally land on Wednesdays and other events. Either like their FB page or get on their email list for upcoming events. We have met so many fun people here and love all who work at Vino as well! Even my kids love Vino. In the summer we will sit outside and I'll have a glass of wine and they will have a root beer and cheese platter. Note: I don't think it's a kid friendly place after 5. It still is a bar atmosphere. If you're new to the area, check this place out. You'll make new friends in no time!","stars":5.0}

The Big Easy finally has the spicy flavor we remember from our trips to New Orleans. We visited on a slow early afternoon. The service was great, the bartender was very knowledgeable.(Zachary) we both ordered the gumbo. I prefer shrimp in my gumbo, but the pulled pork was tasty and the flavor was good and there was a lot of pork. The gumbo is a meal. We were told the jambalaya was very, very spicy so we decided not to try on this trip, but maybe next time. We visited during the day, but I can tell the place is very lively with more of a bar atmosphere at night.","stars":5.0}

She's both solid professionally, and really personable. My appointment was on-time, she let me know what to expect, was really informative about what she was looking for, and answered any questions I had. The thing I was really impressed with, is that she gives you incredibly helpful and professional information, but talks to you like a person. So many times, you have doctors speak to you demeaningly, or seem like your questions are stupid - but Dr. Biscardi really welcomed questions, had great answers, and was happy to answer even silly questions I had about preserving eyes when you do a lot of computer work. She has a great personality, clearly loves what she does, and really likes working with people. Dr. Biscardi was the best eye doc I have ever seen... personable but incredibly knowledgeable. It doesn't get any better than this. I would not hesitate to go back if I ever had any issues with my eyes, and I'd recommend her to anyone I know.","stars":5.0}

Went in after a Sat afternoon leg session, I've been real good for a long time, haven't crushed any donuts in probably 4-5 months. Since there were three in the party had to get a dozen. Stars of the bunch, apple fritter, old fashioned, buttermilk, Kronuts, yeast, coconut, 2nd tier boston creme, crumb, apple cinnamon, pass on the long johns, glazed twists, lemon filled. The first bunch were fantastic, second were pretty close and the third were avg imo. All were light and airy and delicious, might be the best in town. I've been a rise and roll fan for a while now but Pana has really got me rethinking that decision. I think I'm gonna have to have a showdown between the two and put that to the test. I told the guy at the counter I was told these were the best in town (Nicole) so I would give them an honest shot. They beat my expectations, I was impressed. It was Sat afternoon and they had a full selection and were busy the entire time. These guys are legit, 2 thumbs up for Pana!","stars":5.0}

The food had a pur\u00e9ed texture, the chips in the nachos were soggy and the food was cold. The guacamole had no flavor whatsoever and there was a visible layer of grease on top of the food. On a scale of 1-5 I give this a -4. The only reason I chose to give it a 1 star was due to flan that was actually pretty tasty. But, I do not go out for lunch just to eat dessert.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"Not worth a long detailed review, but here is the TL;DR. Visited twice, here is the summary of both times 1) Place was freezing when we arrived. Customers had to repeatedly ask to raise the temperature 2) Staff was disrespectful and gave the vibe that they would prefer that \"those not of their kind\" (spoiler alert, the family I was there with was of their kind, even their church\/temple). Owner\/manager was worse to his staff (perhaps family). The second time, there for a party, he literally told my family to leave because the party went long. If their staff moved a bit faster they may have been able to get done in the time that was promised. We were still waiting on the tea that we had ordered. 3) Food is ok, but service and atmosphere negate the effort the cooks put in. The first time we ordered off the menu. The second time it was a full booking for a private party. The party food was not even close to what other restaurants can provide for food\/presentation.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I used to come to Blicks waaaay back during high school and college to purchase all of my art supplies. I recently came back to buy a new portfolio (my old one finally gave out after 20 years :[ ) and I felt like a kid in a candy store. :] The staff didn't hesitate to welcome me in and ask if there was anything they could assist me with. When I explained what I was looking for, they immediately walked me towards the back of the store where I could take my time and look through the different sizes and varieties of portfolios. After making my selection, I took some time to look around. The store was impeccable and neatly organized. It actually wasn't very difficult to find your way through the store and I really appreciated the un-cluttered feel. The open space helped me see everything they had in stock. Prices are reasonable for the quality of the products they offer. I would definitely recommend Blick Art Materials for anyone looking for art supplies. :]","stars":4.0}

We pointed out to the server that there was a clear layer of water resting on the surface, and she blamed it on the lack of coconut milk in the recipe. Both my fianc\u00e9 and I have had amazing Thai food many times before, and we have never experienced anything quite this embarrassing. Their lack of skill in cooking was clearly reflected by the lack of patrons in the restaurant. I just feel bad for them.","stars":1.0}

Clean, fresh, inviting environment that makes you feel so relaxed while you aren't even skating. Boys couldn't hack skating the whole time so they enjoyed foos ball and air hockey.

{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant for YEARS and have enjoyed their 'Americanized' dishes as well as been adventurous and tried their authentic selections. For sit-down Chinese food this was the place to go. Unfortunately, as their fame has grown, this location has sadly suffered from neglect both in d\u00e9cor (material on booths is worn and tearing) and definitely service! Here's a sad example of their current service: Their website said they closed at 9:30. When we arrived at 8:15, the door said they close at 9:00 which gave us plenty of time to eat. The host told us they're closing soon but that if we hurry, they will seat us. Our waiter, a twenty-something who could use a haircut, reminded us that they're closing soon every time he stopped by the table with tea, appetizer and entr\u00e9e. How rude! Twenty minutes before closing, the entire staff decided to eat and when we left with 10 minutes to spare, some employees were getting in a van to leave. If you want to leave at 9, then change your website and door to say you close at 8:30 versus treating your paying customers like they are an inconvenience!

He asked my name right away and made me feel welcome. It seemed most everyone knew him and several said they come often because of him. It was easy to see why with his fun personality.

We had to come back and try their breakfast. Dinner review first. Jimmy J's Trio and Pastalaya were the two entrees we ordered. Both were outstanding. Being first time to NOLA don't have much to compare to, but the Shrimp and Crawfish etouff\u00e8e was the highlight of the meal. Every bite was delectable. The Pastalaya had some bite, but was even better with some hot sauce. Service was prompt and the line moved quick. As other reviewers stated, don't be afraid of the line! Portions were more than adequate and both my wife and I walked away satisfied but wanting to come back to try their breakfast. Breakfast: Blueberry Brandy Glazed French Toast stuffed with brie. A side of Nueskes bacon and home fries. Also, French Toast Monte Cristo with Nueskes ham topped with an egg. Though it came with a side of Nueskes bacon, I had to order a side of their chef special sausage, pablano-banana pepper. Also had to try the Nueskes bacon bloody mary. Blueberry Brandy French toast was at first a little too sweet for me, but the second bite had a better portion of the brie. It was delectable. The brie was a perfect counterbalance to the Brandy glaze. I was excited to try the Monte Cristo. When I ordered, our server Ryan, provided the best advice... top it with an egg. Best recommendation ever! The Monte Cristo was everything I had hoped it would be. Nueskes ham was perfectly salty and played well with the sweetness of the French Toast and maple syrup. The home fries were excellent. Perfectly saut\u00e9ed green peppers and we'll seasoned potatoes made for a great side. The pablano-banana sausage was good. To be honest, I was too full after sampling the other dishes to really enjoy it. The bloody mary was excellent. I've had quite a few bloodies in my day... this is a top two. Spicy but depth in flavor. Total breakfast bill came to $56. But was more than enough food and drink. When back in NOLA, I will make it a point to make Jimmy J's my first stop!","stars":5.0}

This follow-up to the failed Massa, a Mediterranean\/Spanish BYOB, did a very good job of renovating. The entrance is now a vestibule, and not a long bowling alley entry walkway along the dining room. The dining room is open, with table cloths and table settings welcoming you to a cozy, warm dining atmosphere. And, I enjoyed being captivated by the chandeliers. Speaking of captivated, the Corvina is to die for. The seared tender white fish with roasted corn and crabmeat, a touch of truffle oil was truly a delight. The halibut, again seared, moist and tender, with a couple tender gnocci, was a very good choice as well. We had started with the beet salad and seafood bisque, both 3.5 to 4 star dishes. The fruit tart, I have to remember, was it peach, was very crisp, I liked it. Overall, I am a big fan, and looking forward to my next visit.","stars":4.0}

The lady gave me two menus but the drink that I hear about \"The Bill Cosby\" was not on the menu at all. So at the end of the day I'm sort of turned off.

We had it scheduled for 9 AM for them to start. He said that I should call back the week before we move to verify everything was still a go. Well I called and now somehow they said we were scheduled from 1-3. I told them no that's not what we had setup but the guy said that what it shows and that there were other spots. I spoke with my wife who also said yes it was 9AM so I called back speaking with a lady named Amanda. She acted like she cared but just transferred me to the same guy I spoke with before. So we found another moving company that could move us at 9 so I called back to cancel fox. I got Amanda again and I told her I would like to cancel my move. She mumbled something and just transferred me to someone's voicemail. I had to call back again to get it cancelled.

We are from the gourmet zone in Northern California Wine Country, so we are no stranger to high-priced gourmet restaurants. Frankly, they are hard to resist for too long, regardless of their rapacious prices. Example....Chez Panisse. I mean REALLY...how could a salad cost THAT much?! So you can imagine our shock when the bill came after eating a multi course meal at Commander's Palace! Gracious service and outstanding food and all for an incredibly tiny price, tip included! At first we thought they'd made a mistake. They never made us feel rushed. There's nothing worse than sitting down for a special dining experience to find it marred by overly frenetic wait staff (think Lili Kai of Petaluma for example...they make the Soup Nazi look mellow).

We were really hungry and ordered the mussels as an appetizer. This was our only mistake of the night. They weren't bad but the broth was luke warm and we've just had better. I ordered a special they had of pan fried snapper over angel hair with spinach and my husband ordered tortellini con panna. Both were really good.

This is simple food executed very well that is outside what you will find at most restaurant menus. The place is no secret and is very popular every night of the week. It can be tough to get a group in for a table but the hostess was great about getting a table quickly and the waiter did and excellent job getting all the orders and keeping the beer flowing.

It took me some time to think about colors\/art but I talked with the guy doing them and came up with something I loved and he did an amazing job.

{"text":"I had read the rave reviews and heard the satisfied stories of the amazing dining experience this was, but I was not prepared for the multiple food'gasms that I was going to have with each course I tasted - 8 to be exact, no actually 12 if you count the additional small bites that they served aside from the menu. Some key things to know about this dining experience: -have to make a reservation 1 year in advance. -need minimum 8 people and no more than 12 to hold the 'Farm Table' reservation -it is a 8-12 course pre-fixed menu which changes seasonally -it is $132 per person (this includes tax) -it is BYO and they usually pair a different wine with each course -it is no less than a 3-hour activity -totally worth the wait!! All that said, It pays to stalk a restaurant online, because if I had not noticed their Facebook post on a cancellation they had on a Sunday reservation, I would continue the year-long and then some wait I had been doing. I jumped at the chance to grab the res, but I needed to round up at least 7 more folks to hold for the 'Farm Table' dinner. Asking everyone I possibly knew in the area, I was only able to put together a group of 6 to commit. Luckily, the restaurant was gracious in taking us at the last minute. The shop turn evening restaurant is adorable and inviting. The Farm Table gives much the feel of sitting down to a home-cooked meal, a fancy gourmet meal that is. I loved the intimate concept to be able to dine with your own group and have the two servers only attend to you. The table was beautifully set, each course being brought out on different decorated plateware. They sent us the Winter menu and suggestions for BYO wine pairings for each course beforehand. Our group of 6 arrived with 5 bottles of wine among us. The one thing I wish I had brought was a bottle of bubbly as the servers had lined champagne glasses on the table to start off the meal. Even though we were not able to get all the wine selections they had suggested, they knew exactly how to couple each wine with each course. We started with about 2-3 small bites that were complementary courses not on the menu. Our main menu courses included everything from smoked roe, snails and cod croquettes to sweetbreads, lamb sausage and smoked ribeye. Each course was its own food adventure. One of my favorites was the 'Quinault Steelhead tartare topped with soft eggs and smoked roe with Creme Fraiche and Potato Wafers. I do not know how they manage to bring ingredients together that fit so perfectly in one dish, but it is very impressive. The meal ended with a hearty pecan sticky bun and salty maple ice cream which was pure heaven. We even got chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies for the road. They also have a 'Kitchen Table' dinner which seats you","stars":5.0}

Tonight they delivered, receiving an A+ in all areas or to Yelps rating, 5 stars! I didn't feel like cooking and the boyfriend wanted black eye peas. I go to Yelp, type in \"black eye peas,\" and a few places come up. However, Mama's caught my attention. Some of the reviews made me hesitant BUT the pictures were giving me a different vibe so I went for it. We ordered ahead...Meatloaf with Black Eye Peas and Yams, Fried Porkchops with Mac and Cheese and Cabbage, along with a slice of Red Velvet. Food was ready when we arrived to pick up and was still hot when we made it home. I'm starting with dessert because it was just that good..whoever tackled that red velvet, killed it. So moist and just the right amount of icing and nuts. I LOVED it. It is a MUST order item. AND I wish I had ordered a slice for myself and my boyfriend because sharing this one was tough... Porkchops were fried golden brown, the cabbage was buttery and slightly salty but not too much, and the mac was creamy with plenty cheese. While I didn't try the meatloaf, my boyfriend finished every bit of it. He said it was everything you want in a meatloaf plus some. Ha! I did try the yams and they were just as good as mine at home.

The staff was friendly and polite, the prices seemed to be on par with most Boise nail salons, $25 for a Spa pedicure, $35 for a manicure. I could have used a little more pressure on my feet, which sounds weird and kind of gross putting it in writing but it is a pedicure and I did just recently come off a long hike, so my feet are a little on the rough side.

The Piazza is a ton of fun, and your friends will LOVE to come here and hang out. But YOU will have to be here 24\/7. 1. Only VERY social people who don't mind music thumping through their walls, screaming drunk girls downstairs, mass crowds of the local city folk attending weekend events in their front yard, and light peeking through the blinds should live here. 2. Northern Libs, and especially the Piazza, are very pricing per square foot. $1800 a month won't get you much space here. Definably go for a place with an outside deck. 3. We have experienced two murders while living here. One in the building, and one as the girl was leaving the Piazza about three blocks away. \"Todo, we aren't in Kansas anymore. \" Don't let the crowd fool you...No Libs is still central Phila.

The front desk people go out of their way to learn your name, and the practitioners are very good. The two dentists I've seen have been very efficient and effective in their treatment, and the hygienist Joy is excellent, as she is very informative about your treatment options and treatment plan. Doctor Khouri did a recession procedure on me that didn't work the first time, and was very accommodating in revising the procedure several months later. My only concern is that they are trying to be a patient mill. My insurance is very good and at times I've felt like that they have been trying to take advantage of that, not realizing that my insurance doesn't cover everything and that in trying to increase insurance billing I've been nailed with some pretty steep bills.

The Hot Stuff restaurant is located conveniently on Bell Road in Antioch is typical of most locations you will find. They are located in a shopping center so there is ample parking and all parking is free, this is not typical of many other hot chicken stores closer to town. The store is clean and the staff are overall friendly. You order your selection at the counter and there are plenty of tables for dine in options. You can choose your spice level. You get a lot of food for the money, a three piece boneless tender meal with sides is more than enough for one hungry adult.

If you catch them smiling, they are conversing amongst each other (co-workers) ...as many employees as they have working daily, when you need one, they're nowhere to be found or don't have answers which leaves you searching for another employee who lacks knowledge. The lack of stock at times is unreal.. So many times there are things missing on a weekly basis. With all the people working, everything should be CLEAN AND STOCKED CONSISTENTLY. The fruit\/veggie section leaves a lot to be desired since they don't keep up with this section as well as other Super-Walmarts I have visited, before this one.

It was the weirdest response I've heard\/seen from a server. I ordered the house salad and the chicken. No complaints at all about the food. It was hot and ready. It was just the waiter I thought made the experience unpleasant.

{"text":"I was so disappointed in this resort. I was so excited to book this resort for my wedding night and turns out I was extremely disappointed instead. When we checked in, the man at the front desk didn't seem to happy, was kind of rude.. gave us a map and directed us in the complete opposite direction of where we were supposed to go. Mind you, in my wedding dress.. that was fun. Continue to walk around this place 5 times to find where we really needed to be. Find our room. We walk in, handicapped room. Obviously it was our wedding night, I called them and told them this when I booked in advance, and we still got this room, when neither me nor my husband is handicapped! The second night, we mentioned something to them around 9 pm when we got back from doing everything we needed to do the day after the wedding. They put us in a nice room, which is what we originally booked. But we were checking out that next day at 11, so it really didn't matter. Wasn't the least bit apologetic. I tried calling and speaking with someone there, left multiple messages; still have not received a phone call back. Funny how the manager is always 'is in a meeting' or 'is leaving at this time' the 15 times we have called over the course of a month! Not to mention, all at different times! Ugh it's so frustrating. I only get one wedding night :( I'm so sorry, would not recommend the least bit.","stars":1.0}

Greeting at the bar by bartender was suspect and not very friendly, especially after asking for my ID (at 55 years young, it was a compliment, but unnecessary) while waiting for hibachi to become available. Hibachi became available within 10 mins, which was nice. However, after taking our order, the staff tried bringing out our \"cold\" miso soup and salad together, but also arranged for the hibachi chef to come out at the same time. At which time, I requested that they delay the show and cooking until our entire table was finished with the beginnings. My wife and I also ordered a large Saki and it arrived in very short order, but was luke warm, at best, when it is supposed piping hot and tasty! Dinner was less than tasteful, but ordinary. If establishment, staff and owners were to become more interested in taking genuine care of and actually serving their customers with some interest and emotion, then I would be inclined to revisit and give the restaurant a second chance. Otherwise, we don't ever plan to go back again! This review is meant to be constructive, in hopes that the Owner(s) take it that way, and learn from it.

{"text":"I've been wanting to get here since following its opening on Instagram. Unfortunately, I and my party of 3 were all disappointed. I'll start with the positive. The service was great. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. Second, the atmosphere is so cute and fun. It has a young, hip, and modern feel while still being very kid-friendly...they even give parties with kids a basket with little toys to keep them occupied. While these things were great, the food simply put was not good. The burgers have an extremely strong liquid smoke (or lighter fluid) taste that gives the burger a fake taste and overpowers all the other enjoyable burger flavors. In addition to the bad taste, it's almost like the liquid smoke is pouring out of the burger which makes the bun wet and soggy and your hands extremely messy. I could see the liquid pouring out of the burger in my tray. The fries are average. They're nothing special, but not bad. We also ordered the whole chicken. When it came out we were quite excited due to its crunchy appearance. While the chicken was extremely crunchy, it had zero flavors. My husband had the chicken sandwich, which wasn't on the menu, but we knew to ask about it since we'd seen it on Instagram. He said it was good. Our chocolate milkshakes were good. Other than the atmosphere and customer service, I'd have no reason to return here, which is unfortunate, because I was hoping to love it. Food is also WAY overpriced!","stars":2.0}

I told him how amazing this place was and he took a chance. The amount of conving I had to do boy oh boy haha. We're seated and one of the popular servers who I love gives us water & im thinking tonight will be perfect! But I was sadly mistaken. Our server was an older woman who seemed nice at the beginning but wasn't nice at all. We ordered drinks; those came out right away. Our server asked if we were ready to order appetizers and dinner ; my brother said yes but I was still on the fence. He wanted mussels and because they are all you can eat I stated we'd share. She said we couldn't share so I said okay no worries I'll order something else and try one or two of his mussels to see if I wanted to order that since tas an entree since I didn't have a big appetite. She became pissed she instantly began telling me there no big difference and all this other nonsense so I told her go ahead and put in my appetizer and his mussels as an appetizer in the mean time while I figure out what I want for an entree. 25 freaking minutes later after badgering the bartender politely of course to check on our appetizers because our server was so involved in her big party table that we clearly didn't matter & from then on the shitty service continues. The worst part is my Bf asked me not to say anything to the manager & to do it another time. So I did the next day & was promised they would fix it & offered me a gift card to come back. 1 Month later; I'm guessing spending $200 at a Resturant I thought prides itself on customer service didn't care to follow up with correcting our experience.

{"text":"Good first impression. The store is small, very clean with a decent variety and excellent prices. Don't compare it to Giant that has a huge variety of everything and you can get a full food order. No deli or roaster chickens. Where this store shines is the cheap prices on the basics you use everyday. I was able to fill the entire shopping cart with many deals and expected to pay about $150 at checkout. To my surprise the total bill was $78 dollars. One word of caution. Many of the products especially soups, canned goods and frozen foods have a short expiration date. This is probably why the prices are so cheap. It's still a good value but you must check the dates. Only buy what you expect to use right away.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Honestly, I was a little disappointed. Bloodshed Farms consists of 4 different standard attractions with different themes, a haunted prison, a clown walk through, a corn walk through & a hay ride. They also have addition attraction called the Bloodshed that I didn't participate in. I arrived around 8:15 on a Saturday night & got in line to buy tickets (tip - buy them online beforehand, or on your phone while waiting in line like several people did). Eventually get to the front & pay $25 for all 4 normal attractions (normally $30, but I had a coupon). All said & done with going through the attractions & waiting on the lines for each one I spent about 3 1\/2 hours there, most of it in line. The attractions from best to worst are: The prison, the clown area, the corn walk through & a hay ride. The haunted prison was by far the best (I believe the owners ran a prison themed haunt previously so that makes sense), which has a few different areas you'd expect to find, like a laundry facility, showers, execution chamber, cells, etc. The clown area was still good, but I felt the theme\/sets dropped off. Yes, there are lots of clowns, but not much to give it the feel of an actual circus. A carnival barker, some side show signs in a hallway, I think only 1 room had circus music. Nothing to make it scream \"CLOWNS\" other than just people in clown attire in a normal haunted house. Some of the actors were very good though. The corn walk through (it's not a maze, just a path with jack o lanterns every few feet), was very sparse. Walk 50 feet, go into a haunted shed, walk 50 feet, another scene, etc. For some reason they sent me through this by myself instead of in a group, so maybe that through off the timing, but one actor didn't even notice me on the trail until after I passed him and he was like \"whoops\" after I passed him. The chainsaw guy didn't even bother trying to start his saw or chase me. The hay ride was the worst attraction by far. The wait was ridiculous, a full 74 minutes. Yes, I actually timed it because other patrons warned me the wait was very long. The wait was so long that someone a few rows ahead of me actually relieved themselves in line. Plenty of people smoking in the line too. The actual hayride had maybe 2 worthwhile jump scares, but overall not much worthwhile happened. Several people in line complained that they waited so long at the hayride when they finally were through the other attractions were already closed for the night. I would have been super disappointed if I had paid $25-$30 for 1 attraction! I'm not trying to bash the event or anything, I'm sure it's difficult to run a haunted house, but felt an unbiased & fair review from an attendee was warranted.","stars":2.0}

So let me preface this by saying that the first order came out wrong and had to be sent back.

I arrived 7 minutes early as I had never been there before - the girl who checked me in took my name but never offered me a heart rate monitor. I thought maybe we'd all go over it before we started, but then we started and it was obvious she'd forgotten to give me one. This colored most of the rest of the experience, as I was rushed to put it on - then it clearly wasn't working correctly. Half the time it didn't connect at all, the other part put my effort in the \"red zone\" ranging from 115-140% when I know I was not working that hard. If you're not familiar with their theory, the whole class is based on you being able to check your effort level on the scoreboard (aiming for the orange zone). This was not an option due to my malfunctioning\/improperly placed HR monitor - very frustrating. There is limited time spent teaching\/correcting rowing technique - this is a technical skill which is easy to do wrong and could lead to injury if not done correctly. the floor part was uninspiring as well, the music was meh - and the trainer thought so too as he spent half the time skipping to the next song.

My husband really enjoyed the coleslaw, the fries were decent, but sadly everything else was definitely not worth it. The chicken was both overdone *and* underdone (really? how in the world do you manage that?). The desserts were bad. The creme brulee was *not* crisp on top - it was gross and had clearly been sitting in the case for quite some time. The custard was good, but the top ruined it for me. My husband's chocolate fudge cake was dry, and the eclair was dry and crunchy like shortbread instead of a pastry.","stars":1.0}

Our server also, when I inquired as to whether the muskateller wine was sweet or dry, she answered simply with \"it tastes like cat pi$$.\" I didn't ask how it tasted, I asked if it was sweet.

{"text":"I've never had Tex Mex food before so wasn't sure what to expect. I came to this place when I was on vacation in FL. since the selection of food at the hotel we were at had a very limited selection of food. It was a five minute walk near the Hyatt Place Busch Gardens to where we were staying. To those of you who don't know what Tex Mex food is, it's Mexican food minus the spiciness of the food but basically the same thing. The place was cute and quiet when I came in the early evening. I came during happy hour and margaritas were half off-:) I ended up getting two blended margaritas for only $2.50 each. I got the sangria flavored one that the waiter suggested to me. It was blended and very refreshing to drink on such a hot day.The waiter brought them both out at once along with a basket of tortilla chips and a fairly decent sized bowl full of red salsa. The margaritas were good, but I wish that I had ordered another flavor instead as the sangria one tasted way too much like a wine slushie and I don't really care for wine. Anyways, I decided to be bad and go off my diet since I was on vacation so I ended up getting the empanadas with ground beef and cheese in it. It came with some nacho cheese sauce. I got my order in less than 10 minutes and it was good, but the problem is that the whole meal lacked spice. I had to use the not so spicy chipolte Tabasco sauce on everything and still, it wasn't spicy enough for me. The waiter was nice and the food was reasonably priced and good and so were the drinks, but IMHO, ethnic food should never ever be bland. I don't expect it to be so hot that I'd have to down a pitcher of ice water, but not so bland that it tastes like American food. When I'm in the mood for spicy food, I expect it to be spicy and full of flavor.","stars":3.0}

He took our drink orders, but it took him a little while to bring them back to us, but that was okay. The food was magnificent, on my part I ordered sea scallops and it was amazing. MY husband ordered the Mignon and ordered it medium rare, but when we got it, it was more rare than cooked which was a little upsetting but we dealt with it. After the waiter asked us about our experience we told him about the mignon and we were approached by the manager I believe and he was so nice in trying to make our experience better, which was very much appreciated. Overall my experience for my first time at seasons 52 was amazing I would always refer people to go there.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"We have dined and stayed here for a few years. We are pleasantly more surprised with each visit. This past weekend (Grand Prix) we chose the Hollander for our group Birthday gathering. We were able to reserve 2 cabanas (and our decorations and party favors were waiting for us). When we arrived the poolside the Cabana server was attentive and prompt. He asked us when the \"kids\" were expected to arrive (thinking we were having a children's party). He made us feel welcomed - even at the prospect of 12 little kids running around underfoot. We put him at ease right away, when we informed him the princess party was for a girls weekend to celebrate adult princess's birthdays. The server made certain we had plenty of pool towels and lots of iced cold water. We needed some guidance on beverage choices, and the server was very helpful in recommendations. We loved the Cucumber and Basil concoction and a ginger and mango drink. The appetizers exceeded our expectations. The ones that stood out the most (most unique too) were the Cuban Quesadillas and the Jalape\u00f1o Wantons with raspberry sauce. Our experience was the complete package with excellent service, amazing drinks and wonderful foods. To top off our experience we stopped by the attached coffee and dessert shop. We enjoyed refreshing and delicious iced coffees, and we brought home some yummy desserts for later. Thank you, again for an amazing experience.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I went to a bridal show almost a year ago. I kept getting calls from Sundance after filling out some paper work at the show to win a free vacation. I kept declining their offer for a free vacation, because the \"free vacation\" turned into \"all you have to do is pay the taxes\" so I was skeptical. Well, they reached out to my fianc\u00e9 who decided to hear them out and scheduled an appointment with them and I am so happy that he did! We had our appointment yesterday. Every person we met with was so nice. I read a lot of reviews saying how pushy they were and rude, this was the furthest thing from the truth, at least for us. The person who did our presentation was awesome, friendly, personable, and kind. The sales person we met with after the presentation was amazing and it felt like we were sitting there talking with a friend. The deal we were offered was great. We walked in there willing to listen but were sure we were not buying anything. We just wanted our free trip. We walked out of there with a lifetime of memories ahead of us with our children for close to nothing once our package is paid off, interest free, if we pay it off in a year. We looked at it as an investment into our future, our kids future, and even our retirement. This company is like no other company that I have heard of. My fianc\u00e9 and I have always known that we want to travel with our children, as much as possible. We've been seriously considering purchasing a timeshare but have been putting it off b\/c we just weren't sure and have heard so many negative things. We have a wedding coming up which we wanted to do as a destination wedding but knew it probably wouldn't be possible, and of course a honeymoon that we planned on spending a couple thousand dollars on. Buying this vacation package has opened up so much opportunity for us to do all the things that we have talked about for a tiny fraction of the cost it would have cost us without it. They have 87,000 people who have bought packages with their smaller, Pennsylvania based company and we quickly realized why. As far as the people who claim it to be a scam, I didn't see anything that was even remotely \"scam\" like. At all. We were not pushed to buy. Actually, it was the complete opposite. They sincerely wanted us to be sure this was something we could afford and something we would have the time to take advantage of. They made it very clear that if we chose not to buy, we would still walk out of there with our free trip and that they just appreciated us being there to listen to them explain how their company works and what they do. The people who are stating this company is a scam either wanted a completely free trip (as I expected at first)","stars":5.0}

Grilled Artichoke with aoli, Tuna Tartar with avocado , Steamed Clams in a garlic ,white wine butter sauce ,Tomato Basil soup ,and Winter Salad with clementines , cherry tomatoes and I think cranberries with a citrus vinegrette. They were all very tasty and I would order them again! I had coffee and a long island ice tea to drink. They filled my coffee several times and asked if I wanted another long island ice tea.

{"text":"Everything was ok. Service and food. They were quick to sit us and take our orders but food took some time to be made. We came in during lunch time and all tables were occupied.. so this may be reason for delay. We ordered a smoothie, raw papaya salad and the fried tofu nuggets. I liked the smoothie. Ratio of ingredients was pleasant. Was not crazy about Fried tofu. It had a texture that did not work for me however the sauce that it came with was delicious. The raw pad Thai. It was a salad, true in its form. But I couldn't register any sign that it's inspired by the flavors of both the Americanized or Thai version of pad Thai. So I tried to keep an open mind and consider the papaya salad I have had in past. But still, it is its own kind of salad which lacked in flavor. I will come again. Maybe pass on the salad but definitely check other menu items. Space is tiny but I did not mind it. I found it cozy and decor was cool.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"My second visit to BODO's Main Street Deli (near the corner of 9th and Main) and decided to write a review. I had their \"Lu Tang's Korean Beef\" sandwich, and it was really good. The teriyaki marinade for the beef coupled with the pickled kimchi gave it a great flavor, reminiscent of the Asian inspired sandwiches found in other parts of the country. Main Street Deli is meant to be an order and go type of place. They do have some tables, but the speed at which you get the sandwiches allows you to take your sandwich and enjoy it elsewhere - like back at the office when you're up against a major deadline. They have a modest selection of fountain drinks and chips to make your meal complete. They also offer salads for those looking to avoid the carbs of a sandwich. Pricing is on par with what you're going to get from other sandwich shops in downtown (e.g. Subway or Jimmy John's), but I think the quality of the food is better here. I'd recommend trying out Main Street Deli if you need a quick sandwich that is filling and delicious. I'll be going back.","stars":5.0}

Once we got to the place, we tried to use a $5 off coupon that we had but the server said it was only for Dine In Only. We said that was fine but then she said that she would take $5 off anyway if we promised to come in for Dine In. We laughed and agreed! Once we got home, we unpacked the two bags we had. Everything was labeled with what rolls they were which was amazing. Everything tasted great. I will 10000% order the Shumai again.

We dined here together last night to celebrate a milestone and couldn't have been more pleased with our dinner. We arrived around 6 and were seated promptly in the busy but not overcrowded dining room. Our waiter was friendly and very familiar with the menu and the specials and also able to offer suggestions to accommodate my dairy and gluten-free needs (dairy allergic and celiac). For starters I ordered the chicken posole soup, but the hubby declined soup or salad because they don't have 1000 island dressing and the soup sounded \"weird\". When he saw my soup, he changed his mind. It was very flavorful, the tortilla strips adding the right crunch and the sweetness of the hominy balancing the heat of the chiles. If I had my druthers, I would have cut down on the salt just a bit, but that's a personal preference. Hubby, AKA Mr. Meat and Potato, ordered the Chicken Parmesan at my urging and absolutely loved it and said he'll definitely come back for this one. He was worried at first that the portion was too small, but the large bowl was deceiving and it was actually a very good size. I had the special of the night - grilled Barramundi with braised greens and fingerling potatoes. It was a very tasty dish with the fish being done just right, moist but falling apart, enough veggies to allow mixed bites with the fish and enjoy the flavors together. The portions were huge, so took half home where the teenager demolished it in under 5 minutes. Previous visits have been just as tasty - cauliflower ceviche and pork tacos are my faves!","stars":5.0}

It also is a pretty large restaurant ona pretty major interserction, so it tends to get pretty busy, especially on weekends around noontime.

Quick tip for those of you unfamiliar with the area: If you are trying to get to the diner but on the wrong side of Rt 73, there's a back entrance on Church Road. So just make a turn onto Church Road (right if you're coming from the Philly direction, left if you're coming from Rt. 70 and Olga's Diner directino) and you'll be able to sneak in the back without executing a U turn or a Jersey jug handle!","stars":4.0}

I've eaten here before but more times than not I just take my food home. No soda fountain so it's cans of Coke or Pepsi or Kroger brand for other flavors.

We were served water and my water had something black and fuzzy in it so I asked her for a new glass of water which she was very kind about. Maybe there was a person training but a male server kept dropping things on the floor and having to bring back to the kitchen which didn't seem sanitary. He looked confused, stressed and sweaty. Normally when you go to a restaurant your meals are served at the same time so one or two people in the group don't have to wait awkwardly drooling in front of their food, but that was exactly what had happened at Cozara. Food was pretty good and they have some good lunch deal. I had the sushi box with salmon. It came with salad, miso soup, tuna maki, tuna sushi and edamame. For 16 bucks it's not a terrible deal.

{"text":"Giving this place 4 stars. Located in a tight shopping center so parking is a bit sparse when busy. We came at brunch on Saturday so the entire place was packed. They estimated 20 min wait but luckily a table opened up and we were sat and greeted within 5 mins. Had to wait around 20-25 for food though. The prices are decent ($16 under) but food left us wanting more. Their multigrain and sourdough breads that come with meals are great with butter and preserves. The kale tonic I had was refreshing also. Coffee is self serve which is nice. I had the crab omelette and although the filling was good and plenty of real crab meat, the egg itself lacked flavor. We also had smoked salmon eggs Benedict and in general lacked seasoning and finesse. Million dollar bacon was good but doesn't hold up to the name. Kids plates compare to other kids meals in any restaurant. Total for 3 kids and 2 adults came out to $60 (with tip $72 -- my kids are messy). I would come back to try other menu items but not in a rush.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"The Orchid Show is held annually January\/March and enormous effort is put fourth for this show; almost a year of planning and work before hand. This Orchid collection represents one of the largest and finest in the U.S. and the garden has approximately 7,000 Orchid plants, representing 2575 unique taxa. 3202 are species. The main display of the show is held in the Orthwein Floral Display Hall in the Ridgway Center and there are additional displays in the Beaumont Room in the Ridgway Center and in rotating Climatron. I attended the 2015 Orchid Show on a Corporate Business Partners day. The primary gathering place for the Orchid Show is relatively small. Several times there were bottlenecks where people had to stop and couldn't move around a group or person that was in front of them because they were taking pictures or talking for quite some time. I think in an effort to control the flow of traffic, they were only allowing so many people at a time. A suggestion I would have going forward would be to maybe have this very popular show held in an extended large area or maybe change the flow of traffic. Everything seems to go in a circle but maybe there should be other outlets because you literally have to wait behind the person directly in front of you and the walking space is not very wide. This year there is extra added in about the amazing pollinators of the Orchids. There is a nice display of at least 20+ different bees that only pollinate certain Orchids in certain Countries. They range from extremely huge to very small and all of them do a wondrous job of bringing us such beauty. All in all it was a good experience I was really happy that when I went to the gift shop a majority of the Orchids that I saw in the Orchid show were available for purchase that day. The season for the Orchid Show is coming to an end but the weather will be very nice this weekend. Grab your family or a fellow Orchid lover and head down to the Missouri Botanical Gardens to see the 2015 Orchid Show. The Show is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and general admission to just this show is $5. Also, if you're not a member of the Gardens I would strongly suggest looking into that. Membership is a great way to sustain a great cultural institution in St. Louis and also preserve this historic treasure.","stars":3.0}

Maybe it was my own fault for not knowing ahead of time its technically \"tapas\". One enchilada for $12 was a bit steep for me. Overall the food has fantastic flavor, and the decor and layout is really fun...just be prepared to pay a bit if you're really hungry. * I'd highly recommend the Ceviche de Camarones and the Esquites.","stars":3.0}

They offer wine and coffee, and then I talked with Chelsea about what I would like done. She washed my hair (their products are amazing, smell so good) and Chelsea does a scalp massage as she's washing. It feels amazing, and then she begins her work. Chelsea helped me figure out what to do with my long, thick hair that would be fresh but manageable and healthy.

My only complaint was the level of noise inside the hotel during the late evening and early morning hours. It appears that this may be a bit of a local party hotel, as I heard lots of loud voices outside my room in the wee hours of the morning coming from people who sounded like they had just left the bar. Also, hotel security wanders through the hallways at all hours of the night talking on their radios, which are on a very high volume. This was a bit of an annoyance, as well. The location of this hotel to Tampa International Airport is handy, as I only paid a very small taxi fee to get to the airport.","stars":2.0}

The soup of the day, a delicate \"bouillabaisse\" was fantastic, and the hand rolled pici with mushroom cream sauce was equally enlivening. Wow! The flavours were clean, bright and fresh.

Maybe it was because she's in her 20s and\/or has an eyebrow ring but he WOULDN'T OPEN THE CASE UNLESS SHE GAVE HIM $5. It was totally bizarre, and I was surprised that he did this, especially since her older, staid-looking sister was there with her. It was terrible and he was just an a-hole. This was right after visiting Anastacia's, with much, much better merchandise, much better prices, and an incredibly kind staff. AD is just gross.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"A restaurant should be graded as a whole and believe that service and the atmosphere should always be mentioned. That being said those two factors should never contribute to the majority of the review.

Parking is not an issue. Lots of available parking and will not worry if you go in a luxury vehicle. No chances of being dinged or dented by another car. The restaurant is nicely designed. I would highly recommend trying this restaurant 4.5\/5 The execution of the food was excellent! The presentation and technique was flawless. It would invite you to devour!

Spoiler alert: the bread is free with and without the salad bar, because who is leaving their house for a salad? So the family and I stroll in her new year's day because other places we closed. Coming here is akin to stepping into a non-stop retirement party. The waitresses are old, the patrons are old, the decor is old, the smell is old. It is just an old place that old people love. I kind of love old people, so I was game to try the Jersey based chain. I ordered off the 9.99 menu and got meat, vegetable, and a potato or 10 bucks. The food was decent. The mashed potatoes were good. The meat a bit rubbery and the broccoli was broccoli. All in all the food was just food.

The last time I ate here their portions were super generous and the price was worth it. This time around they weren't very generous and the size of the bowl was on the smaller side compared to other poke restaurants I've been to. I got the bowl with salad as the base, octopus ceviche and salmon for the protein, and quite a few toppings including crab salad and seaweed salad. The bowl was tasty, but it didn't seem to be worth the $15 that I paid. The worker was really nice and she was wearing a mask. The restaurant is very open so there was a lot of space for the three people in there to distance themselves.

Ok, no problem... except you pay by the hour (and it is very expensive) and there are thousands of ROMs so, even knowing what you are looking for, you cut off at least five minutes of your time by holding the up-down stick, searching for the game. As I mentioned, it is very expensive to play games and most or all of these games you can play at home on your old Genesis or NES console. If you don't have these games, you can download ROMs for free from the Internet. Ok, not necessarily worth a one star rating. Yet. How about this- most of the machines had something wrong with them, whether it be a button did not work for one or more player (can't play when the button to give yourself credits is broken), the machine with the X-Men arcade game had a stuck button. The most important button, arguably. The one to use your mutant power which distinguishes your character from all others. Fine, whatever, three stars. We paid for an hour. The first fifteen minutes, this punk with an attitude comes up to us and says our time is up, finish the level we are on and leave. I kindly tell him we still have 45 minutes. I tell him we have until 6:52. He walks away. Fifteen minutes later he comes up again and says our time is up. Getting frustrated, I a little bit less kindly tell him \"no, we have until 6:54, we just told you\". He asked what our wristband said and I again told him the time. So, he comes up to us again when we still have ten minutes and says that his computer says we have until 6:45 and we need to leave. Very irritated that we have been harassed the entire time, I tell him \"no, actually we have until 6:54 as we have told you multiple times already. We have ten more minutes\". He comes up again when we have two minutes left and he says \"it's 6:54, your time is up\". At this point, I really do not care about being nice and it was actually 6:52, so I tell him that we have two minutes and we will leave when the time we paid for is up. I probably said something about pissing off, too. Besides harassing us the entire time, he also was very rude and unfriendly, seemingly getting irritated with us for his mistake. I will never return as this was a terrible experience and definitely not worth twelve dollars an hour to play games you can get for free and not be harassed.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"I am a fan of Nimbus. Have been to Nimbus Bistro on several occasions and would have reviewed it favorably every time. Today is the same. Stopped by Nimbus to catch the 2nd half of the Bears\/Packers game. I enjoyed my Blond Ale (happy hour price $3). I had happy hour prices today because I arrived at Nimbus at 3:02pm. Happy hour runs daily from 3-7pm. This has always worked out well for me because it is difficult to get to places for happy hour when it ends at 6 but 7 is such a better story. I also enjoyed my other two favorites from the HH menu- fried zucchini and a wedge salad. Once when I had dinner at Nimbus, I had the fish-n-chips. I bring this up today because I loved it so much that time that I strongly considered ordering it again today. However, it was 3:02 so I went with the HH menu instead. I'm also crazy about their calamari! So good. Dare I say it is the best calamari I've ever had? Yeah, I think so. Nimbus definitely added happiness to my day! I have no complaints.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I have been coming to this practice for 2 years now and I really like Dr. Downie and her practice! I have always dreaded going to the dentist until I started coming here, which says a lot. The location is great and parking is easy right out front. Front desk receptionist is friendly and polite and it's easy to schedule appointments. They have a convenient system to send reminders via email and text and also to let you know if there's a cancellation and you would like to come earlier which I thought was nice. The practice is a clean and modern space. Comfortable chairs with television screens to entertain you while you have your exam or cleaning performed. Kelly the hygienist performed my cleaning today, and Dr Downie did my exam efficiently and thoroughly and seemed to know exactly what was going on. Last time I was there Dr. Downie herself did my cleaning which I thought was cool. They are both super friendly and professional. I particularly appreciate their straight forward nature and that they didn't try to sell me a bunch of services I didn't need (that has happened to me in the past and I really hate when dentists and their staff pull that kind of stuff - pretty unethical!) so I really appreciated an honest and friendly visit!!!

Great tire to keep us rolling until we are ready to throw four brand new ones on. The gentleman doing the work (not sure if he was the proprietor or employee) wanted to replace my valve stem and lugnuts, but I wouldn't call it an shameless upsell.....I could use them, the stem moreso, but will grab them in a few weeks when I throw the tire I bought today on a better wheel, virgin to the pothole ravages East Indy happily offers.

{"text":"My experience with this store happened around this time last year, but it's always weighed on me and I'd like to share so that others can avoid the incredibly insensitive nature of what happened to my family. The personal, customer service experience: completely rude and curt employees from the start (see below) but the highlight of this visit was the cashier who gave my terminally ill mother unsolicited advice on how to cure her cancer. I mean Netflix documentary\/vitamins\/vegan diet\/the NHS just wanted to keep you sick, deep conspiracy theory nonsense. She had been battling an incurable disease for months at this point, with help from the best doctors possible, brilliant department heads at UPenn, and this man had the nerve to lecture her on spinach as a preventative without knowing anything about her prognosis. I am beyond belief that anyone would feel this is appropriate to do to a stranger with minimal information about their circumstances. He made a beautiful, happy day into an angry, emotional experience and I'm not sure I'll ever forgive that. I hope he reads this and feels ashamed to have stepped over a line he never should have approached. The actual craft\/professionalism experience: To start, my mother called ahead about a dress that they confirmed was in stock, and she made an appointment for two days later. We had a really nice plan planning my wedding and shopping, and when we arrived at Jan's we got a very curt \"oh, we don't have that dress\" with the excuse that it doesn't matter what they said on the phone... they're VERY popular and sell out of dresses all of the time. Well, turns out they did have the dress in stock. My mom was measured, ordered the dress, and 12 weeks later it came in about 4-6 sizes too big. They had insisted that the size they wanted to order was appropriate. While I understand that going with a larger size is in fact a good idea for a special occasion, she was SWIMMING in this thing. We had to have our tailor take it apart and cut nearly a third of the material away. Impressively incompetent all around for such a well known store. I would strongly recommend heading the reviews here before making an appointment.","stars":1.0}

{"text":"Not really sure where to start with this review. We checked in on Wednesday, the week of the 2019 Essence Fest. Walking into the hotel, I didn't get a good feeling about the place. There was a terrible stench, that was even in our room (we'll get to that later in the review). The check in clerk at the \"front desk\" really wasn't welcoming, no smiling, no greeting saying \"welcome\" he just said, \"are you staying here?\" Honestly felt a racist vibe, but we'll get back to that. The air conditioner in the lobby area did not work so on top of being smelly it was extremely hot and humid. The place looked dusty like it needed a deep cleaning. You could literally see dust all over tables and furniture. Upon entering our room, 204 to be exact. There was a terrible smell. Kinda like an old funky basement smell (this smell stayed in our clothes, we immediately washed everything we got home, and deep rinsed) . I loved that it had a loft look to it, with the bed being upstairs, with a half bath. There was a couch upstairs by the bed, but it had a HUGE dent in it, which had us scared to sit down on it at all. There was a tiny little mirror in that bathroom as well. The downstairs was ok, there was a couch, and chair, a microwave, and a tiny refrigerator that didn't work. The bathroom was decent, however there was dirty standing water in the tub when showering. So ultimately we had to get out of the shower and wash our feet and legs in the sink, because we were standing in dirt. The swimming pool was DIRTY! It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. We had our baby with us, and it was hard getting around the hotel and out to the street because of stairs and tiny hallways. There was a nice gentleman that showed us an exit to the street that made it easier, however the next time we attempted to use the exit, an older lady pretty much reprimanded us for it, saying that we couldn't go out that way and we had to carry our son's stroller down the stairs. However right after, we saw another couple walk right out of it and she said nothing to them. There was a racial difference in us and them. Speaking of, every time we entered the lobby the employees would stop speaking and stare at us making us very uncomfortable. On our second to last night we saw a bunch of other African Americans checking in which made us feel a little better. However, they also told us that they were treated \"oddly\". I did like that the hotel was literally one block from Bourbon Street so we never had to Uber to go have fun. This Hotel wasn't terrible but it wasn't great either. I think they should clean it up and turn it into a nice bed and breakfast because that's the vibe we got","stars":2.0}

Having never been to a mattress firm I did not know what to expect. We went around the show room she explained things, we found my bed type which was firm and then proceeded to narrow down the choices she honestly explained the pro\/cons of each price point of mattress and with a no pressure sales pitch made suggestions and ultimately I chose what worked best for my budget. Once I chose we went through the charges delivery, tax etc and then reviewed the warranty policy and Lisa explained any questions I had. I think I was in the store for an hour and never did I feel rushed or that I was bothering Lisa. One can tell she she wants to get you into the correct bed both budget and comfort wise. If you are looking for a sales rep that is knowledgeable and eager to help with excellent customer service Lisa H. Is your gal. I would also recommend mattress firm as a great store, they had wide variety of inventory and also I loved the full transparency from the pricing to the warranty no surprises at all.

I venture to their backroom with a high-top long table to plug in and study without being in the main dining room. I enjoy my mini escape and with access being right next to the bathrooms. I can genuinely say this is one of the better coffee shops in Nashville. I still laugh at the name though. When living in DC, there was a coffee chain shop in the area that was of the same name.

We only ever get the beef pho, so I can't speak much into the other items on the menu (except for the Vietnamese iced coffee, which is fantastic), but I can say the food is fresh and tasty. The environment is great - busy without feeling impersonal. Orders arrive quickly and the service has always been friendly. This place gets pretty packed on weekend nights (as expected), and you get seated on a first come, first served basis, so be prepared to wait. I can assure you that it's worth it!

{"text":"Let me start with the good, I commend them on not making people show their \"vaccination passport\" papers like Royal Izakaya does, because that is fascist, unconstitutional 1943 Germany type behavior, so good for Tomo, boo for Royal. It is also in a great part of town, in Old City and has a nice ambiance. With that being said, I was rather unimpressed with the food, especially with the prices they charge. I got the steamed vegetable gyoza to start. They were extremely mushy, over steamed and soggy. They come with a sauce that is in a plastic container with a top, which feels cheap and lazy. If they can serve the food on glass plates, why not put the sauce in something nice and not throw away plastic? Reminded me of grocery store sushi in that manner. Then I ordered the shitake inari. There were way too many mushrooms (which were too chewy and tasted odd) that fell out as soon as you took a bite. I also ordered a simple acvocado roll, and the ends of the nori did not even connect to make a complete roll. Folks, this is sushi rolling 101!! It's called a roll, not a 3\/4 roll. The rice was also a bit soggy. I also ordered the \"Veggie on fire\" sushi. Again, the rice was overcooked and soggy, the rolls fell apart when you picked it up with the chopsticks. The vegetables on top of the rolls were soggy and plopped on in a giant messy mound. They were also topped with fried onions, which I could almost swear were Durkee brand onions people use at Thanksgiving. I am a chef and if I get a great meal out, I will promote the place to no end, but it felt like this was someones first attempt at making sushi for a social media post or something. I have been here twice, and both times I was unimpressed. There are many better and even more affordable sushi spots in Philly.","stars":1.0}

I went with Toscana and I just wanted to use their facilities. I was a little surprised that the day fee was $45 considering most Las Vegas spas average between $25 to $30 but I paid it anyways. The spa facility is indeed beautiful. The mens locker room has everything you need. Steam, sauna, cold plunge, jacuzzi and showers with water coming at you in various angles. The level above the locker rooms is where the spa services are and they have a seperate waiting area for men and women which I thought was a bit different. Can a couple not lounge together? Anyways, they had the most DELICIOUS granola oatmeal snack I have ever tasted. I had about 7. WOOPS! BTW the spa has multiple refreshment stations with water, tea, fruit, coffee and an assortment of juices. The chairs inside the lounges felt like a cloud and the robes are among the softest ive had in any spa. The upper floor is beautiful. Its a co ed lounge pool with a beautiful fountain, cold plunge and jacuzzi. The \"secret garden\" has really nice reclining chairs with iPods connected with relaxing music. Where Spa Toscana lost a star for me was with an incident with the staff. Just to clarify: the encounters with the front desk staff and the locker room attendence were all pleasant.

I wanted crab cakes, but knew I would order something else too so I got the crab cake pasta. The bartender asked me if I wanted to add fried Gator and I said why not \"While-in Nola.\" This is one of my favorite dishes I have ever had. It was just right. Get a piece of the crab cake, then sauce, then a noodle and let it dance on your tongue. I was dancing a jig while eating Bc I couldn't help it.

The meat was kind of bland and dry and the overall sandwich was kind of flat. Again, nothing special about it at all. Truth be told, I think I've had a better cheese steak sandwich in Denver of all places. There's a place off of Broadway that I still remember as being pretty amazing to this day after having visited years ago. But who knows, maybe I was just exceptionally hungry when I tried that place.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"Went to the sparks red robin tonight for the free travern double burger. Arrived early, just the 2 of us, had wanted to eat up front in the bar, but all the booths were taken, so we sat in a booth in the rear of the resturant. Bad choice, there was a table near us with 5 unruly children and only one adult with them, they were loud, screaming, and all over the place. Maybe awhile before we return to the Red Robin. Our tavern burgers were OK. The beer prices were high, with no prices on the menu.","stars":3.0}

It could have used some infusion of lemongrass, soy sauce and Thai basil. The service was attentive but rush. It took a while to be served the food, although we just ordered 3 items including a drink. Will come back to try other items. Hopefully, they will have a more flavorful punch.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I think it's pretty difficult to get Asian fusion food right. Chifa certainly has a few items that are terrific, but also a lot of dishes that slightly miss the mark. The other thing I've noticed about Chifa is that everytime I go, I think the food is overseasoned. I get that burning sensation on my tongue from over-saltiness as well as just being really thirsty. It's not a terrible place though and in general I am a fan of Jose Garces. - Pork belly bao buns - Really tasty. You can't go wrong with succulent pork and fluffy pillowy bao. The sauce is good too. - BBQ ribs - I also love these smothered in the char siu sauce. - Ceviche - I love ceviche in general. But this place makes some pretty good ceviche. There's also the tasting menu if you can't make up your mind. Make sure you go with a few people (I would say 4 is the ideal number), as most of the dishes are served in a tapas style.","stars":3.0}

Block out curtains let a lot of light in I was putting my baby to sleep which baby only falls asleep in the dark so my husband put up a blanket to over up the light and the employees were knocking so hard at the door we thought it was an emergency or the police well let just say they wanted to break down the door, my poor baby was screaming hysterically, but no it was for the stupid curtain we put up they made us take it down they couldn't wait till I put the baby to bed they are so rude.

There's just so much here to talk about and yet I don't want to give it all away!!! I love coming here and browsing through all the goods. I never come for a reason, or maybe I do, but either way I enjoy wandering from stall to stall tasting delicious samples of bread, cheeses, honey, you name it!!! The people who come as vendors know their sh*t and are so passionate about what they love to do. Everyone is super polite and you can grab food for breakfast or for lunch or just to eat because it's a market and that's what everyone does. I would have to say this is my favorite farmer's market. It's always fresh, fun, and it's in a historic location with plenty of options to browse whether it's in the market itself or you sneak over to the City Market hall...Indy..you have so gotten it on.","stars":5.0}

I had the Thai Fried Rice, $11.99, minus the egg with tofu as my protein. It was excellent and a generous serving. I like that there are several options that include tofu. My friend had the Crab Rangoon $6.99, and the Basil Duck, $15.99, and liked them both. We sat at the bar and had good service. Not surprisingly, there was a steady flow of take-out orders. This has now became my favorite Asian restaurant in town.","stars":4.0}

I said I'm done, we all got up and left because now I had to be back at work in 20 minutes and the other 3 in 30 minutes.

It's bigger, and the setup is cool because there are two sides-on the left is the stage, on the right is a separate room where you can get away from the crowd and actually have a conversation over the music. The stage is elevated enough that you can see the performers from the back of the room, and the sound and lighting are great.

During this past Winter, my mom and I became ill, first her than me, so we had to keep changing our appointment. The last time we called (we were giving 2 weeks notice) the male owner started yelling at us and say we no longer can come to this salon. Three times to change an appointment is subject to banning from salon. We can NEVER go there again. WHAT?? he is an egomaniac who thinks he rules the world. It is so sad because we LOVED the girls that did our nails. We are sad to say goodby to them but grateful we only escaped with a phone lashing.

Delicious, and more than enough for two to share. Door Dash took nine-minutes, from pickup to putting the hot delicious sandwich in my hands. I am super pleased, both with Empire State Deli, (a business where I have never been, but has earned a high Yelp rating, which gave me confidence to order sight-unseen) and with Door Dash, whose slick website and fast service means I'll be ordering through them again.

{"text":"Pros: This hotel had a lot of character, my fianc\u00e9 and I loved the exposed brick walls and the modern appliances. The rooms are extremely quiet too; we had a family in the room next to ours with a screaming baby, but as soon as our room door closed we couldn't hear a thing from them. Location is great - right in the French Quarter and you can walk to anything you want to see. They offered Military discount also, which took about $15 off our bill. Cons: Valet parking is expensive ($40) and the only option if you want your car in a guaranteed safe place and not in a public lot in the middle of the city. It also takes a while to get your car back if you need something from it or want to leave, especially during checkout time when everyone else also wants their car.

As soon as the 2 of them had recommended it, I knew it would be good. We didn't eat but we had about 10 drinks between us all so I can definitely speak to the cocktails! This place is solid. If you are looking for a good drink, this is the place to be. This is not the type of place you order an amateur drink like a cranberry and vodka -- no offense to those who like the good ol' Cape Codder but, these bartenders are talented. I would actually refer to them as mixologists. The drinks here are a variety of classic cocktails (e.g., Bees Knees, Aviation, Manhattan) and innovative cocktails. Either way you go, you won't go wrong. I don't remember all of the drinks I had but I did try to the Juliet & Romeo, a gin based cocktail - 5 stars. The Bees Knees was also great. I had the Saved by the Bell (or something like that) and that was good although not as good as my first. I followed it up by another drink that was also great. The drinks are pricey $12 but worth the money. I would much rather spend $12 on a quality cocktail than on an $8 well drink at some crappy bar. The ambiance is really nice...think speakeasy\/1920s\/bartenders in suspenders and vests, dim lighting, books, etc. This is super cute date spot or a place to catch up with friends. It reminds me of my favorite gastropubs in SD and it was nice to feel reminded of home when away while still enjoying a new city. Hats off to you!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"The quick story-go anywhere else, anywhere. The house wines are overpriced and watery. The service is beyond horrible, and the food is so overpriced and overlooked you're gonna want to hurt yourself for not following this review. The long story, we dined here in the summer for the first time for dinner. Anticipated to view the city while, if not dining, having drinks. The upstairs, outside was closed for a private event, no one was allowed. The downstairs where the main Restsurant was wine barrel themed. Noisy as noisy could be. One server for the ENTIRE large set of tables. He was pushy and we felt pressured and rushed. That time in the summer we vowed NOT to go back. Unfortunately, we ended up there the other night because someone in our group forgot how terrible it was. Hoping it would be better, DISAPPOINTED again! The server was so busy, we felt like it was a hit and run accident. He suddenly appeared, asked if we were ready to order. We were ready to order but weren't quick enough I guess and he fled to do something else. He didn't return. The hostess took our order. The truffle fries ( they were short cut and few) were good, risotto balls over cooked. Flatbreads were overlooked and the duck flatbread was barely edible. Cavatelli pasta was undercooked ALOT and lacked any flavor really aside from hot pepper. The bill for the extreme basic meal for 4 was 200 dollars. And he poured water on my ring and hand!!! How do you miss the glass 2 inches away!!!!! Thankfully it wasn't coffee!!! Never going back. Will go to The Butcher in Germantown (fabulous duck and you can buy it and cook it at home additionally if you like) or go to Bobs steakhouse at the Omni. You may pay more but everything is perfect .","stars":1.0}

Walked up to the counter; and just stated \" I'd like a Medium Coffee to go; please\". That's it. THAT IS ALL I SAID. A kid who I've never seen before in my life; whose face reminded me of a pin cushion; was taking the order. 2 people behind the counter; and myself. I poured sugar into the Medium Coffee; stirred it; snapped the lid on; and started to head out the door. The Pin Cushioned Kid whispered to a co - worker; but loud enough for me to hear; \" There Goes A Trump Supporter \" with obvious disdain. I WAS wearing my company uniform at the time; but is in NO WAY affiliated with ANY Political Organization; or Party. Maybe I LOOK like a Conservative; I don't know. I don't have bobby pins going through both sides of my mouth; and look like Rod Steiger from \" The Illustrated Man \".

Sheena, the owners wife, checked in throughout the day to ensure things went smoothly. The Move Crew had a pleasant, efficient team at a fair price. Thanks for a smooth transaction.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review because I really have loved TT and been a loyal customer - I think the pizza is good (4 -4.5 stars good!), especially the white tomato pie which is garlicky and yummy. BUT, I ordered a delivery pizza in the summer (pizza + salad) and was overcharged. I only live about 8 blocks away, but it was a lazy hangover morning, and we just wanted a meal delivered. We didn't hear the phone when the delivery guy called the first time.. by the time I realized it he was gone back to the store. I called and he agreed to bring it back over (seriously, it really is about 8 blocks away). I gave him a BIG tip for coming back, reheated and ate my pizza, and forgot about it. Later I see that there is a $95 charge on my credit card. My credit card company called the store and spoke with the owner (I was on the line too) and he maintained that I had ordered 3 pizzas, a salad, and a drink, and that the charge was justified. They refused to reverse it. I am seriously surprised that they would risk losing a loyal customer over a $95 charge. When I was on the phone with them (with the credit card company) he asked for my phone number to search for the charge and even said \"oh, you have many purchases\". Yeah, that's my point, I've been ordering from you for a long time. If I say I didn't order 3 pizzas, and you can see every other order I've ever made was for a single pie, why not put the customer first? Sadly, I will be taking my business elsewhere.","stars":2.0}

I'll leave specifics to others. I don't say these things lightly. Nothing against Rodizio either. This place is just a bit better. I'll stop by saying Yelp loses credibility allowing 1 star reviews from people who didn't even eat here due to a reservation mixup. That's not a good thing but it doesn't help to allow a 1star review for it. I gave only 4 stars because the wine list is not stunning.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"When I saw the ratings for this place, i was in shock.. 3.5 stars???!!! cunetto only got 3.5 stars??? To me, this place gets 5 stars and let me tell you why. atmosphere is wonderful, the moment you walk, you see dark wood walls and dim lightings and you can smell the wonderful Italian cooking. the dining area is cozy and elegant yet rustic. This allows diners to enjoy their food without being modest about how much or how messy they eat their food. Waiting staffs are very nice and prompt. Food: amazing with greatttt proportions. Their fish dishes are wonderful and it comes with a glass of wine and a side of pasta. Their chicken Parmesan was little over-cooked when i had it but it was still good. seafood tuto marie is the best. I usually get it in red sauce b\/c it is healthier. Try their garlic bread, and the house salad. the garlic bread is covered in thick cheese and garlic butter the house salad has very nice dressing to break the fat from the garlic bread and calamari.

{"text":"So I wanted to really love this place, and I may try it again, but I didn't see any of the super cool menu choices like buffalo Mac and cheese or the thick cut bacon mentioned in other posts. I decided on the Latin Bowl with cauliflower rice and chicken. The flavors were great at first and then I noticed my chicken was red. I asked for a replacement with tofu, and the quickly made me a new one. They were very gracious and said yes, but then tried to explain that the chicken was that color because it was roasted. I still didn't really trust it though. The brussel bites were really great. They had a nice flavor and spice. The tofu bowl was great. I was really impressed by their cauliflower rice. It was very light and fluffy which I can never achieve at home, so great job!! They also offered me a free drink card for next time. I will probably come back. The staff was really nice!","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice, but the second time dining here definitely left much to be desired. There was a a pretty long line out the door, but my party of two only waited like 10 or 15 minutes. Once we were seated, though, the service became annoyingly slow. We first ordered the taste of New Orleans, which includes small bowls of read beans and rice with sausage, crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, and jambalaya. All of the dishes were pretty tepid. The red beans and rice with sausage were, at best, average to me, and I feel the same way about the jambalaya. I did enjoy the crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e, though. Next, my s\/o ordered the catfish platter, and I nibbled off his plate. Sadly, we were accidentally brought out the fried seafood platter and had to wait quite awhile to get the catfish platter. Once it came, I was pretty underwhelmed by the fried catfish. My favorite parts of the platter were the hush puppies and the fries. All in all, based on my 2 experiences, I'd say this place is hit or kind of miss. I should have stuck with the oysters.","stars":3.0}

I was quickly seated to a lovely table outside, where the waiter was very welcoming. The menu has many different traditional Mexican options available, which allows little to no room to not be able to please the customer. As the food came out, it was truly remarkable. The appearance of the food was a 5\/5, and the taste was very, very impressive. I was able to taste each ingredient, which was very pleasing. I could tell that a lot of thought and preparation went into my dish which was exciting. The overall experience was no doubt a 5\/5. If you are out looking for a new Mexican restaurant, this is a no-brainer.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Columbia is a Tampa staple. The food is consistently delicious and their wine selection is massive. The sommelier will come right to your table holding the largest book of wine you've ever seen, available in a wide variety of price ranges. There are multiple rooms with different environment feels and my favorite by far is the garden room. Their menu is reduced due to COVID but there are still some really great items on the menu. I get Pollo Manchego every time which is a lightly breaded and fried chicken breast, with melted Manchego cheese, sun dried tomatoes, and the lightest most delicious citrus cream sauce that just really brightens up the dish. The paella is great but a little salty. Highly recommend Columbia for your next night out!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Met a couple friends here for late night drinks. Be warned, men can't wear super baggy clothes or hats of any kind (the boyfriend had to go back to the car to put his fedora back... So much for trying to be cool). I have a love-hate relationship with daiquiris: I love them because they're so delicious, but hate how tanked I get from them if I'm not paying attention to how many I'm drinking. So, of course, I had to try the Call A Cab, their strongest drink! What I liked most was that they let you try as many different favors as you wanted before actually purchasing a $6-$8 drink. Yay for samples! I ended up mixing the Call A Cab and Sour Apple, and they'll let you mix whichever ones you want. My only small complaint is that the waiters and waitresses are not as quick as I'd like them to be; the waitress we had also had friends at a different table, and they were getting fantastic service. Me, not so much. But I'd definitely come back.","stars":4.0}

They also use durable Plastic cups for their other drinks. For a company that seems to be doing really well, they should be able to recycle glass, which is the simplest thing to recycle.

The sausage sampler was probably the best part of the experience. Go prepared to wait for a table and then wait for your food. Have to sit outside to really appreciate this place.

{"text":"Food here is more to share - not really any sigle entr\u00e9es to eat on your own. In terms of taste I'd probably rate four stars but because the food we ordered was drenched in grease, I bumped it down a star. My friend and I got the chicken chicharrone, Poutine, and roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts with their cookie in a skillet for dessert. Let me warn you ahead of time - the chicharrone is loaded with oil...every bite has juices running down your throats and it's a very unpleasant feeling. The waitress suggested that we wait until it cooled down to taste but then it was just cold juices running down our throats...my friend and I could not finish it. Plus 7 dollars for like four pieces of chicken skin?? Not worth it. The Poutine and cauliflower with brussels were much better in terms of taste and texture - however I feel that they definitely skimped on the brussels sprouts - there were like two sprouts...and the rest were just sad little leaves which made me really sad because I love Brussels sprouts. The Poutine was quite nice - fries still had a crisp to eat even after being loaded with cheese, onion, and ground beef although again, super greasy. This is just personal preference but I wish the cookie had been chewier and softer - I suppose because of the way it's baked on a skillet, it has much more crunch and crisp so if you like your cookies that way, this would be great for you. I did like the ice cream on top but the chocolate chips sprinkled on top was a bit excessive to me. In summary - give this a try if you do not give a crap about clogging your arteries because it is honestly a nice place to indulge and the menu is quite interesting...but if you're looking for a good meal that will leave you feeling satisfied and not like you're going to succumb to a heart attack in the next ten hours, you should probably go somewhere else.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Recently I stopped in on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday gathering. Overall, I like their concept and the ciders themselves are good, if you like cider. It was a beautiful night and they had the large front doors open and it felt just right. It's great to have a local cider brewing company in Saint Louis, because so many people enjoy it. I tried the Ros\u00e9 cider they had on draft and liked it a lot. It wasn't too sweet, which was something I am always afraid of with cider beer. One thing I really liked... they have other local beer options, even on draft, in case you don't want to drink cider. As far as my actual experience goes, not super impressed. There was one lady, our server who seemed to be doing all the work and had the entire dining area to herself. There were maybe 10+ tables in the restaurant, so our service was pretty slow, which was not her fault. There seemed to be two other folks, a bartender and a manger not really helping out when there were clearly things to do. I didn't get food, but I have heard really good things about it. Definitely will be enjoying some next time I'm in. As someone who doesn't drink a ton of cider, I don't know how often I will be back, but it's a nice place to spend some time with friends.","stars":3.0}

We started off with the combo appetizer which included generous portions of tasty wings, mozzarella sticks and boudin balls (not a fan). We also ordered the shrimp po'boy and the fried oysters basket. It was my first time eating oysters and they were lightly battered and golden fried.

It's nice to have a restaurant that sells real authentic Spanish food available for take out that actually tastes good! I always order their fried chicken platter with rice & beans & 2 pastellios. Their pastellios (beef patties) are pretty decent size and delicious. I smother everything with hot sauce and chow down. They also have some very good smoothie drinks (I opt for the Mango) as well as a large menu to choose from. The staff is always friendly, and if you decide you want to dine in they have tables. They location they chose was a number of different restaurants over the years, none of which lasted. Mayfair has obviously found a gem with Spanish Island because it's been here for quite a few years now and they are still as good as they first day I ordered from them.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I was really looking forward to going to Blupoint, but was very disappointed! We went during Devour Indy and had a reservation at 6:45 pm on a Thursday evening. When I made the reservation, there was no option to choose inside or outside, so they weren't able to accommodate our request for outside, which was okay, but the inside was extremely loud, dark, and crowded. My shoulder was less than a foot from the other table sitting next to us. Our waitress came and we ordered a drink, which took longer than expected to get but I was being graceful as restaurants are understaffed and it is Devour. When the drink came, which was the Mamma Mia, it was 80% ice, if not more, and the ice was overflowing from the glass. It was crushed ice and looked like a snow cone. There were no prices on the drink menu, but I didn't expect it to be $14 for that, which couldn't have had more than half a shot in it. I wish I had taken a photo just to show how ridiculous the drink looked and was. We ordered our appetizer, which was an extremely small portion. I got mussels, my friend got panzenella salad, and my other friend got oysters, which were 4 very small ones. My mussels had about 10 with a slice of bread. We ordered entrees, which I got the squid ink pasta and my friends got the steak with fries. The waitress warned me that my pasta would be extremely spicy, which I usually don't like spice, but had read all the Yelp reviews prior and no one mentioned that dish was spicy, so I ordered it anyways. When I got it, it had zero spice. It was bland, a small portion, and lukewarm. I had to ask for a side of parmesan because it lacked any flavor. They didn't ask if I wanted some fresh cracked pepper or cheese when my dish came either. My friends that got steak were not asked how they wanted their steaks cooked. Both came out very rare, more than either wanted or expected. We finally got dessert for the final course, which they only had two options, both were a chocolate cake type dessert. Not bad, but again very tiny portions, and for a seafood place I would expect a refreshing sorbet or maybe a key lime pie as an option. Our waitress came back and asked us if we were ready for checks and read us our orders back to make sure everything was correct, which she read them back to us correctly. However when we got our checks, two of them were wrong. We pointed it out and she fixed them, so we paid and she came back with our receipts. My friend split her check between cash and card, and instead of the waitress asking her how she wanted to divide it, she kept the cash assuming it was a $20 tip. So then we had to fix the check again, so all around it was","stars":3.0}
{"text":"When Yelp Talk speaks you damn well better listen so when I asked where I should take boo for her bday and was told Cochon I obediently picked up the phone and locked down a Saturday night 8:30 table for two. We took a cab to avoid a parking fiasco but we actually saw a few spots pretty close by. First impression upon walking in was that it was smaller than I expected but was a pretty cool layout and there was ample room between tables. I also ran into one of my hipster friends there so I knew this place must have an edge to it. When the waiter approached us we tried to order our appetizers but he told us that we need to give him our entree orders as well since it was a Saturday night. This was the first time this has ever happened and I really wasn't happy about it. Especuially since there were open tables the entire time we were there. Anyways, for apps I ordered the grilled duck hearts which were the special and boo got the escargot. Both dishes were excellent. I always say when it comes to hearts don't try to over complicate them. They were lightly grilled and drizzled with a bacon vinegarette. Simple and delicious. The escargot was very good however we don't really have enough experience with it to know what's good and what isn't. It seemed to be swimming in butter (which is definitely not a bad thing) and was very rich. I looked at the menu online prior to arriving and had my heart set on the crispy duck breast but when we got there we were told that the menu I was looking at is hardly ever updated and the duck was not available. The pork shoulder was though and was fatty, succulent, and delicious. Boo went with the shrimp and scallops over orzo (or was it risotto?) which she thoroughly enjoyed. Then came desert, unfortunately they were out of the bacon ice cream so we went with the rhubarb crumble (obviously not my chioce). It was really good. In fact everything was very good but nothing was actually memorable, you what I mean? I would have given them 4 stars for the food but feeling like we were under a time constraint was off putting and we probably won't be back for a while.","stars":3.0}

I've never actually sat in there and had a meal so I cannot speak to the service. However I can speak to the frustrating issue of calling in an order (waiting my time as suggested by whoever just took my call) only to arrive and somehow startle the staff by my arrival and request of a pizza.We stopped ordering from them for a couple of years because of the Spicolli treatment. \" whoa dude... you ordered what? When... Awwww bro hold on and let me check......\" That being said we decided to give them another shot recently as our go to Pizza ( Little Italy) place was closed. i reluctantly called in my order , arrived knowing I'd be waiting another half hour.....

I went to another salon a few days later and had to pay another $120 to get my hair recoloured. That Salon was appalled by the poor job done at the Rock, and first suggested I go back there for a redo. However, I indicated that I was not prepared to go back due to the poor attitude all around. As an aside, I also had a Brazilian wax at the same time at the Rock, and I saw later that this was also not done correctly. All in all, a waste of over $200.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"This is one of the newest CVS pharmacies in the city. Located on the corner of South and Delaware, you can park on the north side of the building (off Delaware) or pull into the drive thru (off South). Note that current construction on South Street limits you to pulling in from westbound only. The entrance is on the northeast side of the building. Inside, the space is clean and filled with rows of pharmacy items as well as some convenience store items where you can pick up seasonal items (yes, both Christmas and Halloween items are on display). There are grocery items as well including breakfast cereal that I hadn't seen elsewhere. I didn't use the pharmacy, so I can't really comment on that. I assume they are comparable to other CVS locations. One thing of fun to be aware of if you visit is that there are a couple cool murals on the outside of the building (see separate reviews for details). One is an instagram worthy butterfly wings on the east side while there is a shadowbox of giant butterflies on the south side. Review #3314","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Three stars is because the food gets an A and the service gets an F--that averages to a C I guess. I work in food & beverage. High volume, quick turnover, hungry and thirsty customers who demand service immediately, but I do my job with a smile on my face, giving the guest the benefit of the doubt and killing them with kindness even when they may not deserve it. We walked in and stood for a few minutes wondering where the host(ess) was. Later we were told to sit wherever we'd like but weren't given menus at all. Greeting the guest is something you should do within 3 mins of seeing the guest. Whether your busy is almost irrelevant. You don't need to take my order, just acknowledge your guest. \"I'll be right with you.\" We waited 10 mins to receive a menu then another 5 mins to get the drinks delivered. Our waitress' name was Julie. Friendly when she spoke to us but otherwise felt neglected. The pizza was delicious! We got the pepperoni classic. Have no complaints about food quality. Although the waitress did not check back to see how we were doing at all. The waitress did not refill the drinks either or ask if we wanted a refill. We didn't feel very welcomed, and not to mentioned the service was just lacking substantially. In order to keep customers coming back, it's crucial to understand that customer relationship management is a real thing in business. That fact is make or break in the restaurant industry. Work on the service to keep people coming back, because I would rather take decent food with exceptional service than great food with terrible service.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Look, I don't want to be a jerk, I like old things. But I don't like dirty things, and I can tell the difference. The bed comforter was the kind of cheap, polyester floral number you find at motels, but this one was torn, stained and clearly had sticky food bits stuck to it. I took it off the bed entirely. The bed itself was very, very soft, and the fitted sheet pulled off the mattress in the middle of the night because it wasn't large enough. Perhaps most strangely, none of the lamps in the bedroom worked, and there was no overhead light. I switched the sockets around, switched bulbs around, and I couldn't get them to turn on. All of this probably still would have earned the hotel 3 stars, but the bathroom pushed me over the edge. The shower is in desperate need of an upgrade - yes the hotel is old, and yes it is quaint, but there's no reason to be using a shower head from the 70's. The tub itself wouldn't drain and before i got too far into my quick shower, I was ankle-deep. This isn't a big deal for most people, but it is a kind of intense pet peeve of mine. One of the drinking glasses in the bathroom had a thick crust of detergent all over it (at least, I hope it was detergent) - no big deal, but I'm surprised housekeeping didn't notice. I dunno, it's a hard judgment. The hotel is QUIET and that's a miracle. The staff is well-intentioned, though maybe a little rough around the edges (the doorman told me I \"looked tired\" ). My overall feeling is: for the price, there are other boutique hotels in the area that are better, and there are plenty of chain hotels that at least have draining shower tubs. This might also be totally wrong, so really take this last part with a grain of salt: I think I might have overheard some elderly Japanese guests getting scammed. The concierge told them as they were checking out that they needed to pay a $10 telephone fee, and a $3 safe fee. They insisted that they'd already paid for their rooms. The man made no real effort to explain the charges to them, and at one point the woman held up her cell phone and asked, \"How can there be a phone charge if we used our cell phones?\" The concierge said, \"Oh, okay, I'll remove it,\" and then told them that it was \"Louisiana state law\" that they be charged a tax for using the safe. ???

It was such a unique and mouth-watering combination of flavors, and served on a beautiful wooden board, which enhanced its appeal. I am such a big fan of plantains, and Embermill got it completely correct! The generous portion of curry goat was soft, and had yummy authentic flavors. The portion of rice and beans that the curry came with was delicious, however impractically tiny, so we ate mostly meat for our meal which was a bit strange. The staff was fairly friendly and we ended up chatting with the owner (who is lovely), though we were not blown away by the knowledge or warmth of the service.

It was my first time into the salon so I called and they placed me with a Nouveau stylist. When I came in, they directed me upstairs to the waiting room for the eyebrow wax which was done in a nice, quiet room by a friendly woman. At a past salon, they did this out in the open so it was appreciated to have it done in a private room. When this procedure was done, she walked me downstairs to meet my stylist. I really liked the gesture of her walking me downstairs. The haircut was great, she spent a lot of time asking about what I wanted even asking questions I had never gotten in many years of going to different people for haircut. Even though I didn't fully know what I wanted, she recommended a couple things for my hair and did an excellent job.

Unfortunately, EVEN ON the weekend of Mardi Gras, the room service is unavailable from 1a-6a! This can be easily solved by a call to the Concierge and a local food joint will deliver. Secondly, no open windows in the hotel rooms leaves the air feeling stuffy and thick upon morning wake-ups.

Very tasty meat. The fried chicken Saturday lunch special was ok. I was expecting it to be a bit spicier maybe... cue the smothering of hot sauce. We were prepared after seeing the 25-30 minute wait warning and so were pleasantly surprised when it showed up after just 15, with a generous array of rice, beans and delicious warm potato salad as sides. The famous ferdi sandwich was tasty, though not the best Po Boy (ahem, Parasol's) that we tried in NO. It was supposed to come with debris (we were very excited about the prospect of this) however I thought this might mean there was more gravy involved- it seemed a little dry. Went all out and got some bread pudding too- one of the tastiest desserts! It came warm and delectable moist, stuffed with fruit pieces and bathed in caramel-butterscotch sauce. The staff were all so friendly and helpful that we couldn't help tip our waiter (who did incidentally and very generously deliver us free coffee), in spite of the \"instructions\" telling us not to...","stars":4.0}

There weren't too many people there, which was nice because the ceiling was low, and I can see how with a lot of people and a low ceiling I might have been more inclined to notice the horrific painting of what appeared to be an actual firebird on the west corner of the building. Regardless, the venue was clean and the bartenders were nice and gave generous pours. I overheard the guys taking tickets having a conversation about guitar strings that sounded so insightful and heartfelt I actually began to care about \"gut\" strings until I looked up what gut strings were.

They do have a nice mix of both including south indian dishes, but it is not the typical indian restaurant that this city seems to be full of. Everything that comes out of the tandoor oven is fabulous, from chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp, etc! The butter chicken is just what it sounds like and oh-so-good. The samosa chat is authentic style like you would get from a street vendor in Pakistan. The only thing on the menu that I haven't loved is the biryani, but my husband does and he's all about the authentic so go figure. The service can be slow sometimes, but the food is fresh and actually being cooked in the Tandoor oven, so it's always worth the wait!

We had a reservation but still waited 20+ mins for a table. When I discovered a sealing lid for olive oil in my bayoubaisse, the staff responded promptly and brought me a delicious substitute without an up charge. But I was surprised that that's all they did. I thought they'd at least comp our wine. The creole tomatoes were pale and watery, and the bayoubaisse needed salt (according to my dining partners). I'd say my food--while enjoyable--was forgettable: the experience, however, was great fun with the ambiance and company. And the pain perdu bread pudding was amazing. So, if you're okay with slow service and want to have dinner in an old New Orleans home, Muriel's is perfect. If you're looking for the best meal in town, I'd keep looking.","stars":3.0}

It would not compete with the best German restaurants I have visited, but it is very passable for a fan of that style of food. I enjoyed it.

{"text":"Husband and I were in the area on a mid-day errand and looked forward to trying another new-to-us eatery. It was a bit of a hot afternoon for noodles in broth, so we opted for other dishes: two dim sum items: a duck roll (juicy Peking duck wrapped in a flour pancake) and an order of steamed dumplings filled with watercress, shrimp and pork, and a dinner-sized hot pot of short ribs, string beans, and peppers. The duck roll and dumplings were the best part of the meal. The hot pot, with a flavorful brown sauce and full of vegetables with a nice crunch, featured cross-cut thinly sliced rib sections that were a bit of a challenge to eat due to their toughness. A sharp knife and fork were necessary to negotiate it. Since this is not a dish I have ordered before, I have nothing with which to compare it other than other short rib dishes where the meat was braised for a long time. Are short ribs prepared hot pot style expected to be exceedingly chewy? The restaurant had a pleasant, modern Asian decor and the bathroom was nice and clean!

I organized a farewell party there for about 20 people, and the waiters kindly agreed to keep separate tabs for everyone. When I went back a second time with just 3 friends, we sat in a more intimate booth, and the waitress was incredibly thoughtful and helpful as well. When I went with a large group, the food I got to try came from the shared plates section on the menu: the house nachos were very good, as were the hummus and the excellent hand cut Carolina sweet potato fries (those are really thick). My second experience was more of a dinner situation in which everyone had burgers. My Santa Fe burger (which comes with beef or turkey) could have been excellent. The brioche bun was delicious, the guacamole fresh, and the bacon crispy to boot. Sadly, the meat paddy was so incredibly thick that the beef completely overtook the other flavors. The burger turned out to be overly messy as a result, too. The salad that came with the burger (you can pick two kinds of fries if you prefer) was fresh and nicely seasoned. I hope this helps!","stars":3.0}

After we placed our food order, we waited 40 minutes for our meals, which were subpar at best. I ordered the pork belly tacos.

{"text":"Three dishes here are five stars, and the rest are just three. I'm a little surprised this was rated the #1 restaurant by Philly mag, but I will say I'd definitely come back for these three dishes only: - the babganoush: creamy, perfectly balanced in smokiness and sweetness, sprinkled with pomegranates, divine on the hot pita bread, it lives up to the raves - the chai latte: creamy, foamy, sprinkled with rose petals, totally divine, order this the moment you sit down - the cheese-rose water dessert: I forget the exact name but this blew me away with its crispy, toasted edges, cheesy and warm interior, and pistachio-topped crust, impeccably made The rest of the dishes were disappointing. That Fatteh dish everyone raves about? Yeesh! Such a bizarre, crunchy concoction with a confusing consistency and too-sweet taste. The lamb dish with the cinnamon was way too spiced and off-putting, and the hummus was forgettable. Also wouldn't recommend the tahini hot chocolate. The best part is the cotton candy they top it with (delicious!), but once that's eaten, you're stuck with an expensive Nestle-tasting drink. Just stick with those three dishes and you'll have a five-star meal.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"First time I've eaten here. It was crowded and I thought that was a good sign. It has kind of a snooty atmosphere, not welcoming and inclusive. It is situated in a part of town with lots of poor people (transients camping right around the corner) and people of color and the words \"exclusivity and gentrification\" popped into my head upon entering (e.g. upscale for a very specific and particular crowd). I'm not sure why people like to go eat at exclusive restaurants situated in the middle of barrios or \"hoods\" but whatever. I was not particularly impressed with the food overall. Not bad but not worth the price you pay. Stingy with the coffee...no decaf without paying more money, tiny cups. No vegan options (what's so difficult about making a tofu scramble instead of eggs). It's about time that restaurants provide choices for different kinds of eaters besides the meat and potatoes crowd. These are modern times after all and global warming is due in large part to the negative environmental effects of industrial animal food production.","stars":2.0}
{"text":"After living in the area for a year I am glad we finally got to enjoy a pint and some food. I actually tend to forget about this place as it is a little outside of the normal walking path and the few times we tried before seating was not available. I was recently reminded of this place as they participated in a local wing tasting competition and found there wings to be in the top three so just a few days later we came. Reasons I like this place and would go back. It has history being the oldest craft brewery in Florida. The decor shows this history and is great to look at while talking over a pint or having a small bite to eat. The staff was friendly and eager to serve us and make sure we were happy. We never had to wait for anything nor were we rushed. They also have a very good live entertainment schedule that is constantly changing. So before I finish I consider four stars very good and five stars the best of the best so I consider them very good. Where we were a bit disappointed was the food. We got the raves about pouting and although a creative idea I think it misses its mark unless you eat it within two minutes. We more enjoyed this as tater tots fried cheese curds and pork as three separate items. They were not easy to eat together but we're good separately. Ask for the sauce separately and dunk to your pleasure. We also had the homemade hummus which was good but the \"seasonal vegetables\" is what was upsetting. They consisted of sunburst peppers and carrots. They carrots had to come from a bag as they were all the same size and peeled from a machine. I went on a day of the local farmers market that was 1 block away. If you state seasonal vegetables you could have served beautiful tomatoes summer squash zucchini etc. I guess the point is don't claim seasonal if you don't want to put the effort in. The carrots were off putting by look and taste (the film they developed by being peeled a long time ago) I will be back to enjoy their staff and entertainment. Food will not be a priority for me here.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"I'll be forthright in saying that the only reason my wife and I visited Sakura was because we had bought a Groupon a couple months back. For the value of what the Groupon cost plus how much extra we spent while dining, it was worth the money. But would we ever go back and pay full price? Unfortunately, no. Sakura is not a bad sushi\/teppan restaurant, it's just average. We did not partake in the teppan, so I can't speak for that side of the restaurant, but the sushi was decent. There are pages and pages of sushi to choose from--at times it feels like almost too much--and they are all moderately priced when compared to the rest of Tucson's sushi establishments. My wife and I had no problems finishing both of our rolls and the sushi chef behind the counter was very eager to interact with us. Not a bad experience eating sushi at all. Where Sakura goes wrong is its appetizers and desserts. We ordered the Rangoon and for $8.95 we got five bite-sized servings of rangoon made with imitation crab. It was mostly cream cheese filling and very little imitation crab and while it was still tasty, it was not worth the price at all. The same thing can be said for the Tempura Ice Cream, which was basically a ball of ice cream with soft dough surrounding it. Again, it was tasty (it tasted like a funnel cake), but for $5.95 I would have rather just bought dessert at a grocery store... or a funnel cake.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"Two years later and I'm finally getting around to writing this. Rincon Beach did the catering for our wedding in 2009. It was an offsite event, and there is not a bad thing I can say about them. Marc (the owner) came out to our ranch (the venue) and we sat down and discussed everything. He put my dad's mind at ease about the financial part of the wedding. We worked with Melissa through out the entire planning process and she was such a delight. I felt like she was one of my friends by the end of the process. We decided to add the ceremony planning package (I'm an event planner so I didn't want to be doing ANY planning during my own wedding). This was by far the best decision we made. Unfortunately Melissa couldn't be at our wedding. Which was OK, she kindly handed over her assistant Jaime. Jaime was just as great as Marc and Mel. I felt like I didn't think about anything about my husband the day of. I would look at Jaime and she would just tell me what to do. In a very kind and not pushy way. She was perfect. That's my review on their service...now let me get to the food! People are STILL raving about the food. We had a steak, fish and veggie option. All of which I heard were amazing. Of course I didn't eat much, but I had the steak and it was perfect! One of my vegetarian friends said it was the veggie option she had ever had at a wedding. My favorite part was the appetizers. Since we were taking photos during the cocktail and appetizer portion of the event. The caterings staff brought the head tables large plates of appetizers so we could try them. I have never seen this at an event, and I thought it was brilliant. This goes back to their wonderful service! My friends still rave about the chicken won tons. All in all...Rincon is the BEST.

It's a perfect mix of modern (gray everywhere, my favorite home decor color), with older style of subway tiled bars and hexagonal tile floors. Yes, I had to spend time and Google the history more while we were waiting. I only wish I could have experienced it in its heyday. Not sure who our server was, but she was great. We stayed for a while as we ended up staggering drink orders (a beer to start, then a whiskey, the one bloody Mary, then another etc). She let us take our time and catch up too, not hurrying us or being annoyed. Between us all we had duck sliders, macaroni and cheese, traditonal burger, the German and the pork belly tacos. My impression was everyone enjoyed their food. The burger disappeared, we made our friend make the Wendy's \"$2.99\" joke with the sliders, the German had great flavor and the macaroni and cheese was ooey and gooey with real Bacon crumbles on top. The ketchup is house made and delcious. The tacos were good just cory was expecting soft tacos not fried, but he survived. He already said he is getting the depot burger next time. I have been craving some creme brulee which they didn't have in their dedicated and fancy sounding dessert list, but they did have a creme de pot (so custard) with house whipped cream and some sort of black sprinkles I missed the name of. Whatever they were, this was a perfect ending to my meal and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. The bloody Mary's were excellent, also house mixture. But the happy hour looks to be a good deal, about $2 off drinks and apps it looked like. I think while they have spendier items, they also have a good deal with cheaper options that aren't just olives or fries like you see elsewhere in town. I had been putting off visiting thinking it would be pretentious and break the bank, and while between us all we splurged for this meal, you come back and not spend much while still getting a lot of quality food. Also they have the bean board games (the name is completely escaping me right now) out front that we all had fun with too. Ideal for killing time if waiting per chance? As well also a huge luxury couch with games upstairs too.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"What I love most about TOCO is the fact that, unlike Goodwill and Savers, they make every effort to keep sets together and sell them that way. Meaning if you donate a set of dishes or a set of bedsheets, TOCO sells them as a set rather than splitting them up. Also, if you have old clothing that is no longer wearable, you can donate it here and TOCO will recycle it. This Is the only place I donate to.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Before it was the goal of every restaurant, bar, and cafe in America to have \"the world's best burger,\" there was Fuddruckers. Fuddruckers was one of the first chain establishments that understood the potential of the hamburger, and treated it with respect. Today, they have some fierce competition, but their burgers still hold up quite nicely. In fact, after going to a Fuddruckers in NE Philly about 11 years ago (which is sadly no longer there), I understood for the first time what a really good hamburger should taste like. Give this place the respect it deserves and stop in. Your mouth will thank you.","stars":4.0}

{"text":"Nimit Palace is located in a pretty generic looking strip mall on White Horse Road in Vorhees. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but on the inside it is surprisingly simple and nice. The space looks small but there is seating for 30. We went on a Sunday around 2:00 PM. There were a few other diners. The nice thing about Nimit Palace is that they serve their lunch special menu on the weekends. I had the Chicken Tika Masala and the Lamb Curry with Nan bread and this set me back $7.99! It was a decent size portion and the flavors of both dishes were very good. I always use the Tika Masala sauce with my rice and Nan, I love that stuff. My daughter had the Tandori chicken and my wife had Lentils (Dal Makhani) and a Saag Paneer. We shared all the dishes and we all were happy with taste and quality. We finished up with the Gulab Jamun and Rasmaiai and a Mango Lassi. Both desserts were not super sweet and had unusual but pleasant flavors. We really liked the Gulab in the honey syrup and served warm. Our servers were very friendly and attentive and made us feel welcome. I really liked Nimit Palace and it is serves very good Indian food at reasonable prices. We will definitely make a return visit and explore the menu further.","stars":4.0}

As of 11:00am I still have not received a call back from enterprise about the car I booked. I ended up in a panic this morning because I had a critical appointment at 9am and enterprise was unable to honor their reservation. Thankfully I was able to borrow a car from a neighbor very last minute. That will be the last time I ever rely on them for a rental.","stars":1.0}
{"text":"I'll be honest we only stayed here because one of our other hotels fell through and we needed something quick. We really weren't expecting much, but we were honestly surprised. Only one of the elevators worked which we thought was strange, but it never really bothered us. After a drunken night on Bourbon St, we discovered that the tiles in the hotel elevatorbsquished and looked like blood, which we thought was pretty cool. Our room was decent, but it was a little strange that there was a closet with a mirror hanging on the outside of the door right beside our bed.That creeped us out a little. There was 2 TVs. One in the room and one in the living area so we could watch different things if we wanted and we appreciated that. The bathroom was tiny tiny tiny and rather uncomfortable for my 6'5 300lb husband, but it worked. The breakfast left a lot to be desired as it was mostly just breakfast pastries and donuts. Also, I thought it was strange that I had to ask for water to drink because they only had apple juice, orange juice, and coffee none of which I drink. Overall we would stay here again we actually liked it much better than one of the higher rated hotels we stayed in.","stars":3.0}

This isn't the place to get the latest Dan Brown, but wander in with an open mind and you're likely to find something.

They also have a great urban planning\/city and art sections as well.This is a great independent bookstore that should be supported.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"I debated four or five stars because it was a little more expensive than I think it should be, but it's also a couple short blocks to the beach- 5-minute walk maybe? Super close. Plus hit the FREE Carriage Museum across the street to see some fun old stuff. On checking in the staff was super friendly but I forgot his name (young fellow with thick brown hair). We were early and the room wasn't ready yet but he was happy to take our bags for us to walk around while we waited for the room. We took the train up so we were thankful he was able to store our junk while we pounded pavement looking for food. He also gave us a map and some highlights which we really appreciated. Upon checking in, the room was great. A little small but it had a king size bed that was comfy and everything looked clean. Cheap champagne in the fridge, we of course drank it because why not. Bathroom was fine as well, larger shower stall which I appreciated. AC unit blows hard! Don't know why people complain about the noise of them because that's just how they're made. I'd rather have some noise and crisp cold air than something without good blowing power that's quiet. Plus, it helps with any outside noise (because we could hear some of the others in the rooms around us). Wine and cheese hour is great, cookies were kind of hard for my tastes but \"included\" is a good price. Breakfast was a nice spread of the usual - boiled eggs, pastries, bagels, toast, all the toppings, yogurt parfait, 4 cereals, oatmeal, OJ, coffee tea milk and cocoa. Oh and fruit - fresh whole fruit and some cut fruit. The place is really kept up daily. Gardeners and cleaners were constantly working all around. Wipe down the railing on the balcony? Great job guys. Lots of shrubbery and green stuff growing so that was superb too. Included bike rentals across the street were easy to access and helped us get around quicker than walking. Hot tub is also across the street and not here, but it was easy to get to even if it was disappointing. 2.5 feet deep, not very hot and super small - 6 people max. Oh well, can't win em all I guess. Overall we may stay here again if we venture back to SB. Location was great, staff super friendly, room clean, bed comfy and lots of \"included\" with your stay. I just wish it was a little cheaper. But I'm also aware that I'm kind of cheap, and SB is kind of an expensive area. PS 711 is a 2 minute walk for your late night munchies\/beer runs for the hotel. Also the market on the other side of the 711 had KY favorite watermelon peletas. Yum.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I called Automotive Sound and Protection in Norristown PA to inquire about installation dates before I purchased my Groupon. They informed me of install availability and told me to purchase through them instead of the Groupon site and took a $50 deposit from me. They then informed me the price for my vehicle would be significantly higher than the $119 Groupon price due to the vehicle type. I told them to cancel and refund my $50, Heather who is one of the owners then told me \"to go F*** myself\". To this point there has been no refund. I wish I would have read some reviews prior to calling them as it is easy to see the consistent pattern of complaints. As a business owner myself I always want other businesses to succeed but I think it is time for Automotive Sound to look in the mirror and make some serious changes if they wish to survive in a competitive industry.

They have soooo much stuff here. I'm scared to try anything else because I love what I've had so far.... Quick Tip: If you get the fingers and fries, please start off small with the fingers (3 max) because those fries are a killer. This place is also a bit pricey, 3 fingers is $3.69! I'm used to 3 wings at the corner store being $1.00 so I was taken back by this.","stars":5.0}

They put up stained glass so it doesn't feel like you are floating in a parking lot. It's got character. Also, we tried the sandwiches today. I'm usually not a bread person but these buns were seriously good. Soft, flavourful, very fresh.","stars":5.0}

But when you're trying to watch what you eat or have some dietary restrictions, it's nice to have a diner that serves a healthier version of good old diner favorites and new fresh options. The establishment is clean, the employees are friendly. We've gone at lunch time on the weekends and one time we had no wait, the next time just a short wait (like 10 minutes). Their two versions of huevos rancheros (one with bison, one with roasted vegetables & quinoa) are absolutely delicious! We've mostly stuck to the breakfasts so far because there are just so many great healthy options to choose from. And they've got lots of excellent options for the kids meals too!

We've been staying in room 266 during the first two nights, now we are in room 152, the one we got told, that has way better wireless LAN. Before I come to talk about the wireless LAN, I'd like to write about the rooms and everything else after we've been staying at 7 different days inns on the East Coast. The Days Inn on Baltimore Pike in Springfield, PA, is the worst we've been to. They are neither on the expensive, more on the inexpensive end of line but they are the only ones that do not offer any kind of breakfast, have the smallest rooms, no fridge and no microwave in the rooms. For a rate of $75 - $90 a night, at least the high speed wireless LAN should work as promised. And if it does not, the staff should not ask the guests to call the technical support on their own to try to fix things with them. Guess they are hiring a company that should care about the wireless LAN in this days inn but they do not really seem to care. I've called them twice, they are nice, friendly and try to help with things but even a reset of the router does not help at all. Currently we are asking for a huge refund. It's hard to work without having any wireless connection at all in both rooms. I'd recommend not staying in this days inn at all. I wonder if I can talk to the owner tomorrow to see how we can handle things.","stars":1.0}

Yes, this is very much geared towards convenience because the immediate surrounding areas (St Roch\/Marigny) are heavily populated by visitors. I realize this annoys locals, but I have a fondness for it because it reminds me of my beloved Korean delis in NYC (minus the 24 hour part). Their selection of vegan\/organic stuff is a humble beginning (though, 7+ bucks for packaged yuba noodles? I don't think so) but could use serious improvement, as it's regulated to a couple shelves in the refrigerated section. More vegan cheese, please! Props for the huge non dairy milk selection!

{"text":"This is a review of the highly regarded Townsend Restaurant during a Restaurant Week meal here. I can certainly see glimpses in the food of why restaurant critics have been very positive but based on my experience I can only give it a middle-of-the-road assessment. Basically the food quality is excellent - if only there were just a little more of it. I know I am one that has often been critical of restaurants in America serving too much food but here is one that serves too little. I get it that Townsend is haute cuisine and portions are on the small side (or you won't be taken seriously as a gourmet restaurant) but you probably need to go outside Restaurant Week and spend even more money to enjoy their taster's menu of 5 or 6 courses to feel like you have had a meal here. A lady at a table on the other side of the room was on her mobile phone and told whomever she was speaking with that she had stopped for a snack on Passyunk Avenue. I had to laugh when a Restaurant Week dinner is called a 'snack' but that's what it kind of is.(An expensive snack though!) I have lived in Provence in the south of France and though I probably have never eaten in one of the Michelin's starred restaurants, of course I ate out many times and in many awesome places and I don't remember portions like this. The first course was a Roasted Squash soup which I didn't know was soup when I ordered it because 'soup' was not written on the menu. One of the two girls at the table next to me also didn't realize she was ordering soup when she chose the roasted squash appetizer. C'mon - is it some kind of trend that you can't write the word soup on a menu? The soup was fine - all 7 or 8 spoonfuls of it. It reminded me of a roasted pumpkin soup in Vienna but it was not quite as tasty or filling. The bread course was good especially with the addition of a pepper dipping sauce. The main course was a vegetable risotto that was most delicious and very small. It would have been such a nice gesture - especially during restaurant week just to increase the portion even by 50%. A wonderful Huckleberry cobbler completed the meal. Service was cordial and efficient throughout dinner although I didn't really need to re-hear the list of ingredients of each dish that I ordered when it was served as I had just read them on the menu. I can imagine Townsend would be a great restaurant to go to when money was no object and you could indulge in more courses than three and try out some of their wines. However if you're searching for an opportunity to try out a fine restaurant during Restaurant Week and getting value for money, I'd look elsewhere! Tip - Be aware that an appetizer and an entr\u00e9e on Townsend's Restaurant Week menu incur","stars":3.0}
{"text":"We drove 45 minutes out of our way just to be able to have dinner and watch the sunset. Sam's did not disappoint. The wait was long, but it was a Saturday night. It took almost an hour to get a table. The one thing that we didn't like was that they won't allow you to sit at the bar to wait, because of Covid, but everyone is told to wait at the bottom of the ramp outside and be just in as close of quarters. I just didn't quite understand that and the wait would've been more manageable had we been able to have some cocktails while we waited. They did create a new cocktail on their menu, it was a strawberry basil bourbon and it was fantastic. We also enjoyed some of their draft beers from Florida microbreweries that were very good. We did order the nachos for an appetizer and they came out on basically a cookie sheet. They were loaded with toppings and were absolute perfection. So much goodness and value. We were so full from the nachos we weren't sure if we were going to order more food, but couldn't pass up the seafood pot. We got the ultimate pot of crab, shrimp, clams and oysters, sausage, potatoes and corn. It was all so full of flavor. It was $30 and absolutely loaded with enough food for two. We shared. We still had to bring all the sausage home and it was enough to feed both of us for breakfast with some eggs. The view of the sunset was fantastic, the building and bar and deck are everything you want for a tropical Florida feel. We would definitely come back again.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Much like how actual contemporary jazz musicians tend to talk more about Ambrose Akinmusire than say John Coltrane, you'll find more locals infatuated with Moore's than most any other hot chicken spot. This isn't to say that Hattie B's or Prince's or Bolton's is the equivalent of something as nuanced and revolutionary as John Coltrane, but they're the equivalent to the fact he's what non-jazz artists think of when they think \"jazz.\" Moore's Hot Chicken, by all means, shouldn't work. It's in a strip mall in between five other restaurants. Moore himself can be intense if you waste his time ordering. Not to mention that every single time I've gone, the only person in the kitchen is Moore himself, and rarely maybe one or two people sitting to eat. So why do I consider this the best hot chicken in the state? Well, food at it's root is about personal preference above the intricacies of public opinion. Although you might at first doubt the personal taste of one person, me hello there, I have been a local in nashville my entire 26 years of living, and have been fortunate and privileged enough to eat at the finest restaurants across the world, including in Faroes, Scotland, Paris, Bahamas, etc. I've always tried to retain a sense of exploration and interest, always willing to try and savor the unique tastes and preferences in flavor of those who love what they love to make. I myself, however, am not much of a cook. To the best I can I'd rather leave that to the professionals trying to get by. All this to say, I might have only my experiences to draw from, but those experiences are colored by a myriad of individual, real, and careful people. And the reason I enjoy Moore's is because it is honest and real. There's no attempt to draw you into a false sense of security and anticipation about your meal. It speaks for itself. He doesn't need to smile and garner your interest. The food does it for him. The hattie B's and Party Foul's of the world fill you up with drinks and sensation to justify their meals. It is an experience laden with the false satisfaction of transitioning from simple tourist to knowledgeable traveler. You go back home to Dublin, Ohio and accidentally happen to book a bowling lane next to the sad family of your uncle's widow so at some point you bring up that, \"nashville is a blast, so fun and active. really took my mind off of things. we hit the pedal taverns and we got hot chicken, which was so good, oh my god you should try it. yeah it's really actually spicy, not as much as i'd have thought but I get what they mean about 'hot chicken' now.\" and she smiles at you politely, but both of you are just filling in the air because nothing you can say can really get to her core and help her because you never were that close to your uncle.

{"text":"Embassy Suites Hotels - 110 West Washington Street Indianapolis, IN 46204 - Room 1723 * The ventilation system was very noisy, I could hear the main roof fan suction & supply noise. Better built buildings install sound traps on the suction & discharge sides of their fan systems. This is necessary on the main air conditioning & heating systems & bathroom ventilation systems. If you are on the lower floors the noise will dissipate as it travels away from the fan. But the closer you are to the roof the noisier the fan noise will be. I was one floor from the penthouse or top floor. I called the front desk they sent a maintenance person, he said he would checkout the noise to eliminate it. He didn't reduce the noise level at all, and I never heard back from him or the hotel staff about the noise. * The drapes in the bedroom didn't close all the way, there is a gap. The white transparent drape is installed closest to the window in one room and installed the opposite way in the other room. Not a major problem, it's an indication of not paying attention to the details. * Only one tissue dispenser (it was in the bathroom) none in the living-room, bedroom, kitchen. * The sink in the bathroom backs up and needs to be cleaned out with a snake. I called the front desk they sent a maintenance person. * The light level in the bedroom or living room was too low, it was hard to read in too many locations. * The living room sink cabinet's outside surface has not been cleaned in a long time, it is very dirty. * Not enough electrical outlets for computer or phone\/tablet use. The computer desk in the living room didn't have any convenient outlets, I had to plug in next to the sink. * NOW THIS IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE: At 0100 on the checkout day (I stayed two nights) I was awakened by a very loud noise coming from the bathroom wall. I called the front desk and told the person about the loud noise. He said he never heard about this problem before, but he didn't think it was necessary to send anyone to check it out. I believe it was because he knew about this problem, if he didn't I would think he would want to investigate it. HE WAS NO HELP AT ALL! I stayed in this room two nights, this was the first time I heard that noise, it lasted until 0241, then went away. My educated guess is the noise was water hammer, refilling their water tank. But it was definitely water hammer for that 1 hour 41 minute period. The ventilation noise continued from day one until I checked out. * To add insult to injury: I had a horrible stay, and when I check my credit card charges, I found Embassy Suites overcharged me $505.44. On my checkout day they charged my card the correct amount, then 4 days later charged me","stars":1.0}

Cafe Soho is more of an experience, which may be overwhelming for some. They have music videos playing on TVs, which was kind of neat because you get some KPop while you dine. However the music does get a little loud at times, so be weary. The food was really good! Ok, I should clarify, we only ordered the wings, but it was really good. I'm hoping to go back and try something else. We had to leave before we could really dine, so we asked one of the waiters to box our food to go. Someone from the restaurant came up to us as we were leaving to make sure everything was alright, which was really nice. I guess it is weird to leave right after getting your food. Now for the important stuff: They do have some street parking in front and there is a lot around the corner (I'm not sure if we legally parked there).

While at an event in Orlando a couple of years ago we found what became our favorite Cajun style seafood place. It was so good we would, once in a while, drive to Orlando just to eat there. Well the Tasty Cajun is just as good, with a similar menu. The menu is limited to crawfish, shrimp, clams, and blue and snow crab, with some combinations. However, that is what we went for. You don't have to do a huge menu if you do well the things you do offer. The food is served in a butter garlic sauce with 4 levels of spice. The x-hot could be hotter though. The shrimp were very large and fresh. We didn't order crab, but noticed when preparing some they were still moving going into the water. Overall, great food. The restaurant is small in a little strip center, and seating is communal at several long 12 top tables. (If you don't like that, the food comes out plenty hot to take home.) The waiter was clearly new, so a bit timid, but he did fine, and checked with us just enough. I reserve a five for perfection, but think this place deserves a 4.5.","stars":4.0}

Their office manager Carissa came in and tried to guilt trip me claiming that it was my fault I needed more surgery because I couldn't afford to get the crown within 2 weeks after my root canal. I refused to pay for an additional R.C. knowing something was fishy so she tried to make it seem that they were so gracious and Dr Kim was going to pay for my second root canal herself. I knew there was something wrong but was at their mercy financially at this point as they had maxed out both of our dental credit cards. I literally cried knowing I would have to go through another procedure. I do not numb easily and it is painful. Carissa did not know that my husband was in the waiting room and when she finished guilt tripping me about a second root canal she came out in to the front office and began to make fun of me to her staff and in front of patients saying \"She is crying back there\" My husband was absolutely shocked. I called her later to confront her. No responsibility for her behavior was taken other than offering 280 dollars back and did admit that they screwed up in getting me scheduled back in time for my crown placement that I had to wait for due to an unexpected extra 300. The charge cards they maxed out on one tooth should have covered everything and then some. I have yet to get a detailed summary from Care Credit to see what they charged on it. At their mercy now financially, I followed through and had another root canal and crown placed which was made by the assistants in the office. The crown was not fitted right and has caused so much pain that I am now seeing an Ear Nose Throat doctor for possible nerve damage because the pain from this tooth has been radiating in to my jaw and now ear. Dr Melanie Kim adjusted this crown twice and still claimed nothing was wrong with it and insisted that it was the tooth behind the crowned tooth that was causing the pain. Unfortunately, this dental office's exorbitant costs from just one tooth, rendered us unable to purchase yet another root canal for the additional tooth she claimed needed RC treatment. In desperation to get this pain over with after 5 months of them messing around with this one tooth my only option seemed to be to extract the other molar she claimed was the problem. So X rays were taken and a date scheduled. Upon arrival on the day of surgery Dr. Kim looks at the x ray that she should have looked at the week before only to tell me that she cannot extract the tooth. They set me up with their oral surgeon on yet another date. I had been in pain now since","stars":1.0}

{"text":"The place has a large room, is beautifully decorated and looks modern. There is a bar on one side and tables and booths on the other separated by a wall decorated with bull fighting related pictures. We were excited to hear about a new latin restaurant in our neighborhood. At first we thought it was a Cuban place based on what we read about the owners, but it turned out to be primarily Mexican with some Cuban dishes. We went there for lunch a few days ago expecting to find something Cuban on the menu, but the lunch menu was strictly Mexican, so I asked the waitress about it and she brought out a different menu. We both ordered Lech\u00f3n Asado, one with fried yuca and the other with fried green plaintains (tostones), both come with rice and red or black beans. At first the food tasted good, we were hungry and had been anticipating the food at El Toro. But once we dug into the meal we noticed that the tostones were definitely not fresh. They tasted like the frozen Goya variety you can buy at a supermarket. The rice was OK, but you could tell it was made in a rice cooker and not the traditional way, in an iron pot. While the pork and beans were OK, the dish lacked authenticity. At $19 per serving this was not a good deal. Not sure we would return, even to try their version of Mexican food.","stars":3.0}

Even though I would have liked the sambosa to have been a little more filled, they were delicious. I ordered the mix grill, which came with a chicken kabob, meat kabob, and a kafta kabob. My favorite was the chicken - really moist. Kafta was also very good. Dish came on a bed of rice, topped with a little veggie-curry mixture of potatoes, carrots, and peas, and also a piece of bread.

{"text":"There are a plethora of cupcake shops in the Whyte region, yet I always find myself coming back to Crave to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings. They have one of the best recipes in town! The cakes are moist and flavourful, with a decent variety of flavours to choose from. The real highlight of Crave for me is the icing. Icing is the moist important part of the cupcake, imo, and Crave does is completely right. Their cream cheese icing is amazing! Just the right amount of sweetness and the perfect texture. The flavours come in the usual vanilla and chocolate, but also have fun lemon-lime, coconut, and so on for you to try out. The cupcakes are reasonably priced. About $3.50 for a full sized and $1.70 for a mini. My favourite thing to do is grab a half dozen of minis so I can try a whole bunch of flavours! They are the perfect size and the lot costs $10.95! The cherry on top of this awesome shop is the parking lot out front. No hassle trying to find Whyte Ave parking for your cupcake fix!","stars":5.0}
{"text":"Our visit here was quite unfortunate which is the very reason why it took me this long (almost 7 months to write this review). Our senior pup (17.5 years of age) was in a lot of pain, had bad dementia, and was really not in a good place anymore, albeit she seemed happy with us on occasion, anyone could tell her quality of life has declined and we had to make the worse decision any caring pet owners would ever have to do. We asked if we needed to make an appointment initially (in person but I didn't go) but were told to just come in. We came in on a gloomy Tuesday, fitting for what we had to do. I came in and went straight to the receptionist desk. The receptionist was very kind. Immediately after finding out why we were there, she took us into a private room to gather all the information, take care of the payment and left us there for as long as we needed before sending in the doctor. We ended up with Dr. Thomas and he was very compassionate and understanding about the situation. They took her out for the IVs and came back wrapped in warm blanket and left us alone again for as long as we needed before sending the vet once more for the final process. It was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever had to go through but the respect and compassion the staff and the Vet showed us helped so much. A few days after her passing, we received a condolence card from Dr. Thomas and a week and a half later, we received a notification regarding her ashes being ready for pick-up. I wish I could give this place so many stars for being there for us during one of the toughest times in our lives.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"My best friend & I spent the weekend in Philadelphia for Made in America. We were in dire need of great food! So we asked a friend who was familiar with the area & she recommended Honeys' Sit N Eat. The location was pretty good! I was able to find parking quickly. We caught the brunch rush so there was about a 15 minute wait, but it seemed like 5 mins. The restaurant itself is small & tight knit but that makes it all the more amazing! The ambience was extremely fitting, cool, comfy & somewhat of a southern vintage feel! I loved it! My best friend & I actually ordered the same thing just in different variations. We built our own omelets with a side of potatoes ( I had the Latke & she had home fries) homemade biscuit (SO GOOD) a buttermilk pancake & fresh squeezed OJ. The list of ingredients for omelets was pretty long. The first 3 fillings are complimentary then there's a $.75 charge for any additional. I had chorizo, tomatoes , scallions & cheddar. Yum! Everything was fresh! Delicious! The presentation was even good! Our waitress was a sweetheart as well, making out dining experience even more delightful. We spent about $20 each which is great for brunch! Oh! Honeys is CASH ONLY! So be prepared, there was an ATM inside but it was out of order. Whenever I go back to Philadelphia I'll for sure be visiting Honeys'","stars":5.0}

Unfortunately, so much potential and hope leads to so much disappointment. I've tried several times before writing a review, mainly to remind myself to not be caught up in all the glimmer and remember the fools gold...the food. The presentations were well executed but the food, across multiple dishes and visits, lacked flavor and authenticity....for some reason everything seem to have a smoked paprika dusting (smokey flavor is not a personal preference unless it's turkey or Gouda). Unfortunately, it seems to be an overpriced restaurant with mediocre \"Mexican\" food banking on the neighborhood's increasing demand for restaurant\/bar diversity. That being said, the owners' other restaurants , Hawthorne's and Cambridge are consistently great.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I lived in Suwon, South Korea for one year and grew to love Korean food. I was excited to hear about Seoul Fresh and it's convenient location at the Circle Center Mall. I went to see a movie at the mall theatre and thought it would be the perfect opportunity to grab something quick at Seoul Fresh. There were only two options; a chicken bowl and a steak bowl. I ordered the steak bowl which was a very simple version of bulgogi Bimibop (a traditional vegetable, beef and rice bowl, with spicy Korean sauces, with a fried egg on top). The flavor was good , and the dish was very filling. Ideally, I would like to see more choices at , Seoul Fresh, and I would also like to see them add a couple more ingredients to their bowls. However, if you're in the area, and looking for a decent place to grab something healthy and quick, Seoul Fresh is a solid choice.","stars":3.0}

{"text":"I wanted to like this. (Especially for the cost of admission which was well over $100 for our family of 4.) However, our experience was spotty. We enjoyed some aspects; the highlight was the fantastic art pieces created from trash that was washed on shore in the \"Washed Ashore: Art to Save the Sea\" exhibit. The art was impactful and the kids were really fascinated at the types of items that the artist used, as well as disturbed at how serious of an issue this is. I love that Audubon chose to display this wonderful art-- if my kids were interested in this very serious issue after seeing the impressive art, then surely, so too would others. What we didn't enjoy was that on the day we visited, the aquarium was overrun by field trips. Of course, kiddos and schools should visit the aquarium but it seemed that there had to have been fire codes broken by the sheer number of screaming kids. I seriously wondered if the capacity of the building was exceeded. It also only took an hour or two to go through the exhibits, and after paying so much money, we would have expected to want to spend more time there.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I really would like to say something great about this quaint little cute bakery that's in the perfect location on Judge Perez. We ordered a cake from them for my nieces 6th birthday. Her theme was Uni Kitty, which is this cute little cat. When I picked up the cake I noticed that it was extremely plain and the decorations were minimal. I felt like I could have purchased something similar if not better from Walmart or Rouses. The main reason we decided to go with Mad Batter was because of it's called Mad Batter and we assumed that they would be very creative. When we ordered be cake we thought that the photo would at least cover the entire cake, but instead it only covered about a quarter of the cake leaving the remainder bare... I don't understand why a bakery named Mad Batter wouldn't be more creative than that especially for $80!!! I'm an extremely disappointed. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the cake was very moist... it wasn't the best tasting but it was fresh. With that, I'll just say that I wouldn't recommend them and I don't plan on ever using them again.","stars":2.0}

{"text":"I would recommend All Pro Lawn Services without hesitation. We have them mow, edge, blow weekly. We tried a couple other services in the past but none of them got it that we like our lawn to be kept on the longer side. They insisted on mowing it so short that it would scalp areas and just not look very good. We don't have that problem with All Pro. They cut it the length we want, edge all of the gardens, and clean up after themselves better than I did when I was doing it myself. We have also used them with Fall cleanup (I hate racking leaves) and were pleased with the exception that they pruned some plants that shouldn't have been pruned. Next time we will either mark those plants with ribbon or something or walk the yard with them before they get started. They are also really good when it comes to billing and customer communication. Very easy to get in touch with them and they have always responded quickly to anything we have needed. Oh, they also do fertilization and bug care on the lawn. They always notify us in advance of when they will be here and tell us what they are doing and what we need to be aware of like stay off the grass or water it in, etc. It's a bonus that the crews speak English and that it is nearly always the same crew that does our service. Long review but it might save others the frustration of trying to find a good company in a field as crowded as it is in Treasure Valley.","stars":5.0}

We brought a bottle of wine ($15 corking fee- not awful split between 4 of us), which was a nice a way to save some cash. The food was very good. I had a salad to start- nothing to write home about (a little heavy on the dressing for my taste). My second course was a flatbread which was very good, and my entree was the Scallop Rissotto. These were definitely some of the best scallops I have had in a while! The desert was by far the highlight. It was some sort of chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream and a caramel sauce on the side. All 4 of us got this and could not stop talking about it. We really enjoyed the atmosphere, and the decent food on top of it made for a great night!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant We arrived 7:15pm and had to wait to put our name on the waiting list was 10 minutes. After a 30 minute wait we were seated where we waited another 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. Our bread was brought to the table, excellent seasoning and perfectly crisp. The salads came out after 15 minutes wilted and bland. The wait for our meal was so long that the bus boy began coming by assuring us that the food was almost ready. At 9:15 our meals arrived-- My fianc\u00e9 and mother in law ordered the catfish, family friend got the fried chicken, and I the white wine shrimp special. Ooohhh lord-- The catfish was salty with bitter greens, the chicken under seasoned while the macaroni tasted of boiled pasta topped with shredded cheese and then baked. White wine special was room temperature, smelled of bleach, and looked like a bunch of leftover sides thrown onto one plate and called an entree. After 2 bites of the white wine special, I sent the disappointment back to the kitchen with my waitress. Shortly my waitress and some lady come back to the table asking if I want the food left on the table or boxed. I explained once again that I didn't not like the food. The lady (who I later found out was named Tracy) tells me that the food was prepared correctly and my not being pleased is a \"personal preference\". Shortly after receiving and paying the bill I asked for the lady's name and found out it was Tracy. As we are preparing to leave Tracy comes out AGAIN to ask once more if I wanted my meal boxed up (the one that has now been sitting wherever for 30 minutes). My mother in law and I both reiterated that the meal was displeasing and no, we did not want it. Tracy begins explaining why she came back over, but at this point I was ready to leave the restaurant and not return. We walked out the front door ready to leave-- only to be followed by Tracy who yells to the \"security guard\" that she wanted to make sure he was still out there. Avoid Dooky shits at all costs unless you like terrible food and horrible service, go around the corner to Willow Maes.","stars":1.0}

My finger was cut while he was clipping my cuticles, and instead of just blotting with paper towel, he rubbed roughly to the point I had to pull my hand back. Then as he was filing the dip, there was clearly a spot missing color, he looked at, but then didn't fix it until I said something. I had to file some of the corners when I got home because they were sharp even though my nails were rounded and I noticed that they were bumpy.

{"text":"I went in on Friday the 13th because I was having severe abdominal pains, leg pain and back pain. When I got there they only dealt with the abdominal pain and decided I was constipated. After buying medicine they prescribed and taking it for two days I was still in pain, if not worse pain. I went to another urgent care and took their assessment of me being constipated and told it to the new doctor, wanting new meds. Fast forward to Tuesday and I'm in bed crying from pain. My boyfriend left work early to rush me to the ER. After being 2 cat scans, a pelvic exam, an ekg, and an ultrasound, I was diagnosed with DVT (deep vein thrombosis - blood clot) in my thigh, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) from my IUD and a UTI (which they claimed I had no infections after giving them urine). The IUD caused my PID, caused an infection in my veins and gave me DVT. Had they told me to go to the ER when I originally went because I had more symptoms that weren't related to constipation, I might not be in the pain I'm in right now. Thankfully this was caught on early, but had I just kept on believing this was constipation, I would be having a worse time right now. I don't remember the doctors name, but I know it was a male.","stars":1.0}

Secret tip : This place gets crowded. Parking lot isn't the largest real estate in the country either. Get here around 8:30pm and you'll beat the rush hour. You're welcome.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I went on a Sunday afternoon to this beer garden in Irvington. There wasn't any special event going on, so there wasn't any food available, or entertainment like a party or movie. Just a nice open space with pergolas, a variety of tables, and a fire pit. I will also say that going by myself didn't help any since there was nothing going on but people with their dogs drinking beer. Getting here is also odd. You can see the venue from Bonna Avenue, but you can't drive straight back to it. There is a fenced off private parking lot directly north of the garden, so you have to enter on the gravel (and somewhat bumpy) driveway on the east side of Coal Yard Coffee and then drive back behind that building to use the gravel lot east of the garden. There is a metal ramp to get up to the garden level and then most of the patio area is a wooden deck. I did find it odd that the area by the fire pit is not level with the deck and has a different base. I wasn't watching and nearly stumbled when I stepped off the 1 1\/2\" drop while going towards the pit seating. During my visit, I didn't notice any wait staff, just a guy sitting inside the building behind a counter. I couldn't read the handwritten names on the taps, so I had to ask what they had available. After I learned that they don't do flights, I settled on trying their Oktoberfest (a German Marzen ale). They serve in plastic cups and I noticed a number of covered trash cans around the patio for convenience. The beer was okay, but not my favorite. The patio was nice, but I could sit on my own porch and drink a beer. I thought the bartender would be a little more welcoming when I mentioned it was my first visit and when I asked about flights, he said I should just go to the regular brewery on Washington Street. They had no intention of serving those here. My advice? Watch their Facebook page for an event. Go with some friends and bring your own food to snack on. Otherwise, it is just a nice place for the locals to hang out and gather with their dogs. Review #3178","stars":3.0}

{"text":"In town overnight for a conference and looking to avoid chain restaurants, we popped 2.3 miles over from our hotel to try Jockamo's. What a great decision that was. Go there now. Setting is hip without being hipster. Food is fresh, delicious, and a good value, to boot. Breadsticks, house salad, and some house special pizzas hit the spot -- Slaughterhouse Five, Chicken Pesto, and a zippy Creole with crawfish were our choices. We had to debate what not to get, so many great creative pies on the menu. And service was outstanding. Only one wish -- that the owners install some sound-absorbing acoustic panels. Noise levels on Sunday early evening were high as voices bounce off of concrete floors and wooden tables and chairs. Nothing soft in the place to keep the peace! If you have the chance, noise aside, go eat some of the best artisan pizza you'll ever have in a pretty darn good setting.","stars":5.0}

Made reservations online through Open Table which were very easy to do. Loved that since not many bars offer reservations. However, when we arrived at 5:15 for our 5:30 reservation they said they were clearing off table for us. We waited till until 6pm to sit, missing the start of the game. We then didn't get a server until midway through the second quarter. We had the cheeseburger which didn't taste like anything but the fries were great. Wings -- eh. Tasted like frozen Tyson boneless Buffalo wings. With how unorganized it was, we probably won't return but it's not a bad place.

I felt like that got me nowhere so I called DoorDash myself and they got in contact with the store, and since I ordered fron the store directly DoorDash was not able to help me get my refund but told me the manager named JT could help with my refund. I called wingstop again and upon speaking with JT he immediately started claiming that all items were In the bag when they left the store. I asked him what does that mean for my refund and he hung up on me. I called again and JT claimed he didn't hang up on me and was being extremely rude and sarcastic. He said that he wanted to give me my refund but when he talks to his general manager she's going to say no, but id have to go to the store to find out. Terrible customer service all the way around.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Pascucci's last Saturday night and hadpetty poor service with good food. We ordered the weekend special which includes 3 courses and a glass of wine for only $23 which is a great deal! However, our waitress was so unbelievably incompetent she pretty much ruined our meal. For starters, we didn't receive our glasses of wine until after we were halfway through our salads and the entire time we could see them ready and waiting at the bar-side for her to deliver. Finally, I caught a busser and he was willing to deliver us our wine and extra side of salad dressing which we asked our waitress to bring and she neglected to do the first time. The busser and very polite hostess continued to assist us and the surrounding tables. Our waitress was not only not helping us but her entire section was not happy with her inability to properly wait their tables. She seemed so unaware and oblivious to her poor decision making that finally she got the hint from one of the 4 tables that she was screwing up. The next big mistake was after our dinner plates arrived when our waitress came over and asked if everything was good and I responded with \"the food is really great\", and she replied with \"I'm sorry the service hasn't been so great, the bartender is new\". I was even more infuriated that she's was trying to blame the bartender!! Our drinks and others were waiting for over 15 minutes at the bar for her to deliver. The bartender made the drinks to order without delay and all 4 tables kept looking over there. I truly debated getting up and bringing the wine over myself! Again the food was good, but the service was probably the worst I've had in years...","stars":3.0}

Honestly the TNT shrimp appetizer was the star of the show but it was very overpriced for the amount given... especially because it came in the tiny shrimp cocktail cup.

The bar is also novel and it made me think of a whirlitzer. There is also a great beer garden in back, which I look forward to visiting in the spring. The service is great and there's a nice, chill atmosphere. While there isn't a large beer selection, they do have local and imported beer. They have Stella Artois, so I was happy.

That being said, Barney's is one of the more expensive places in the area. On average, their prices are about 10-15% higher than local competitors. I would probably chalk that up to the usual dealer markup. Unfortunately, I really have to gig them on their maintenance department due to current policies. I went in a couple months ago to get new tires and was told that they generally don't work on bikes over 10 model years old (mine's a 92) due to \"potential liability\" concerns with older bikes and that I would need to bring in my rims in order to have new tires put on. I understand if they wouldn't want to work on electrical systems, carbs, or other parts that are hard to find these days and\/or are somewhat fragile due to aging and wear\/tear, but telling me to take off my rims and bring them in to have tires put on is pretty absurd.

On the day of the wedding the staff was incredibly accomodating- Sarah, Michael, Francisco and the other staff members made everything easy from start to finish.

When we arrived, the staff was confused and very disorganized, nobody knew which group they were to work with and no preparations for us had been made at all. Our consultant asked minimal questions and just started grabbing dresses off the rack asking us, \"Is this good? How about this?\" She didn't know anything about the dresses or the designers. She then took us to our \"fitting area\" which was just a large shared room with other bridal parties. They gave us 2 fitting rooms for our 4 girls and said we had to share. Even though we had BOOKED 4! Then... to top it all off, our consultant took off as she was double booked. Another lady offered to grab us correct sizing but out of the 3 dresses the first consultant had provided us to try, we didn't like any of them.Nobody offered to bring us other dresses or even any suggestions AT ALL! We packed up and left without so much as an offer to help further or even ask if we were leaving. It was an absolute joke!!

First - they really need a display for the donuts. Right now they're crammed on a couple of plates under glass domes. Would be nice to see the donuts and have them labeled. Old fashions are great and the chocolate cake was really good. Unfortunately, all of the donuts are very dense & cakey with none of the light, fluffy kinds. The spoiler was while we were sitting there an employee started mopping the floor. With bleach. Right at our table. I had to move my feet. That smell was enough to drive us out.

{"text":"I got married on October 24th 2015 and used La Rouge for my bridal hair and makeup. My entire bridal party also used them for their hair and makeup. Everyone looked gorgeous! La Rouge did a really good job of highlighting everyone's natural beauty and not making anyone look overdone, which fit our wedding. We got married at the SB Natural History museum, and so it was a rustic\/organic\/bohemian (i guess?). La Rouge did a great job of matching our makeup to that type of vibe. I did extensive research when looking for hair and makeup for my day of. My main criteria was price. After looking at all of the highly rated bridal makeup artists on Yelp, La Rouge was by far fairest in pricing. Not only were they fair in price, but extremely easy to work with. I was able to easily schedule a trial for a Saturday (which costs extra with other makeup artists) with the owner Rachel. She took the time to assess my skin and walk me through the pros and cons of getting airbrush makeup since I had never done it before. She also spent time walking through the \"inspiration\" photos I had sent over, asking me what exactly I liked with each one. The whole process took about 5 minutes, and from there she was off, checking in with me along the way to make sure I was happy with what I seeing. After the trial, it was extremely easy to make my deposit to save our date. La Rouge does electronic invoices, which makes it beyond easy to stay up-to-date on the numbers of services order, cost, etc. Whenever I made a change to the number of services needed, it was just a quick update to our electronic invoice, with no need to send attachment after attachment with the updated amount due. This made it easy for me to communicate with my bridal party on what services they were down for, as well as how much they owed me for them. Day of, Rachel and her team arrived promptly at the location where me and my bridal party were getting ready. They were fun, relaxed, polite, and truly added to the overall positive atmosphere of that morning. There were a few of my bridesmaids that were running a bit late, and Rachel was beyond flexible in switching up the schedule to make sure everyone got the services that they needed and that we were still all on time. In terms of gratuity, it is automatically added to the invoice if you order more than 5 services. For me, that wasn't a problem at all. It was actually nice to be able to check that off list, since day-of I was busy prepping tips for all of our other vendors. I can't recommend Rachel and her team enough. Also, if you're wondering if you should do airbrush or not, I recommend doing it if you have oily skin. I tend to get oily in my T-zone throughout the day. The airbrush makeup was wonderful- didn't","stars":5.0}

She immediately diagnosed his very aggressive cancer even though it was in the very early stage of his cancer. A lot of vets can miss this diagnosis this early but she was spot on. I did meet with 3 other specialist to get a surgical and chemo plan in place, and they all agreed that it was Osteosarcoma. My dog is almost at a year post diagnosis while most dogs are gone the first 3-6 months. Because of Dr Morrison's skill and knowledge Kingston is here today. The team does pretty well with my helicopter mom ways, and I'm sure they understand that it is just a stressful time when a family member is sick and you feel helpless at what can be done. It's great that they are open 24 hours and on weekends. They have never tried to have me do more than needed with my dog, and I'm usually the one wanting to do the extra bloodwork and exams.

{"text":"This place was an okay farmers market on a Sunday morning. I have a couple gripes that I think other visitors have as well. First, Saturday is the artisan market (more crafty) and then Sunday is the classic market (still crafty but farmers too). So basically on Sunday morning... I am expecting farmers more than artists. However, it seemed evenly split, maybe more crafty stuff. We came at 11 am mind you and the veggie stands were super picked over (or maybe small in general). It's also a very very cramped plaza. People walking into each other... craft booths were taking up clear walk paths through the plaza so occasional traffic jam. My thing is this. Some people come to farmers markets to just buy food. Just food. Some people want to come for an experience... food, some arts, some paintings, and some kinda entertainment (music, native american talk when I was there). Obviously, I am the other group, I just want lots of food booths with fresh produce\/product, an environment where you can walk and browse without hit someone, and pretty much that's it. Basically we left and we went to the farmers market down the street which was much better. There are some unique booths at this one so I still think it's worth checking out and seeing if it's your thing.","stars":2.0}

It also comes with a complementary hot drink for free, or cold drink for an additional $1. I'm a big guy and I always leave full after one bowl. It's comparable to a large bowl of pho.

We had pizza and Parmesan garlic bread this time. Next time we'll try the calzones and mac 'n' cheese. The only downside to this place is that the marinara dip is served cold and the drinks are served in cans (even for dine-in). They would change this if they could, but their franchise overlords will not permit it. This did not detract significantly from our experience. Update: Came back to try the mac 'n' cheese.

On a recommendation I called Anton's to come over for one last bid before we made our decision. I'm so glad we did! The salesman that came for the bid was friendly professional and offered advice that wasn't pushy. One thing that I appreciated right away was Anton's sales. He had seen the service sticker from another company, which he so happened to had worked for in the past. Explained the differences about the two companies (which made Anton's stand out more) and never once said anything bad about the competitor. As a sales woman myself I admire and respect when people choose the high ground when it is way easier to bad mouth the competition. Unlike the other bids I received, Anton's was the quickest to come back and the most detailed. I was given pricing for different models and also what the rebates from Ameren were. Installation day came, and it went smoothly. The team showed up on time and was courteous and professional. They took great effort to ensure that my house was just as they found it. From the crane to the clean-up it was more than I could hope for. I am looking forward to continuing business with them in the future. Oh and the price- they were about 3k and some change under the company we were originally going to go with!","stars":5.0}

Sandwich heaven. Still savoring it hours later. Oh, and the fries were excellent too. Plus they have a small but very solid and varied draft selection.

There were also signs at the cash bar, cautioning that there would be no intermission during the 90 minute play. I'm sure many people with small bladders appreciated this particular heads up. When I entered the Maclab Theatre, three ushers helped me find my seat. I found the sections and seating were pretty straightforward but I appreciated the help from the ushers. I sat in section B, row G and seat 3. My ticket was only about $30+. It was an awesome view for this low price. I was kind of glad that I didn't buy the more expensive seating! You can get a great view from pretty much any angle. Although from the extreme sides of the stage, you would obviously get more of a side view of the actors. In addition, the rise of the seats allow you to easily see past the person in front of you. As I'm petite, this is an important feature for me. It's not fun to have your view obstructed during a play. The acoustics were pretty good! I didn't have a hard time hearing the actors even though they didn't have any microphones. However, someone with hearing difficulties might have some trouble. In this case, it may be beneficial to get seats closer to the stage to hear the actors more easily. Overall, I enjoyed watching an amazing play in the Maclab Theatre. I've seen shows in the other theatres\/venues at the Citadel and they've all been wonderful experiences!

Waitstaff has been hit and miss on the occasions I have been there. Trainwreck usually has decent live music acts though, which is nice to just veg out to while sucking back some beers. Can't get over the holier-than-thou vibe though. Get some new attitudes and I'll update my review.","stars":3.0}

Would not order again for that price. Grilled chicken sandwich: chicken fit a little over half of the bun so when they cut it in half there literally was one bite of chicken on that roll. I also ordered a side salad in place of my fries, they charged me $3 extra for a super tiny salad. Wish that would have been mentioned or they could have given me my fries too then. Since it cost $16 for a sandwich and tiny salad Fried chicken sandwich was good nothing amazing We will not be coming back to eat, possibly drinks another time, but there's just too many other good places in the area to bother.","stars":3.0}

But I am also discerning in my pizza tastes, when you've eaten as much pizza as I have, you learn a thing or two. Pizzava stands the test of taste and time. The test of taste is that fresh out the box experience. Generous sauce, the perfect cheese balance, edible crust (yeah, I sometimes throw away the crust to focus on the headliner), and an appropriate amount of toppings. The test of time, it tasted good the next day. The generous sauce really helped with the test of time because sometimes the sauce is overcome by the crust and cheese after a night in the fridge. Not so! I was just as pleased day two as day one!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"I had an A\/C unit that stopped working and the issue seemed to be electrical in nature. A very nice technician named Mike came to the house and did a great job explaining his efforts and ultimate did fix my problem. The low rating is because of the pricing structure that Riteway used. 77.00 for a diagnostics. Expensive but okay. Mike then replaced a single board fuse (a 10 part) and charged me 130 dollars. Then Mike suggested replacing the blower motor capacitor, which he cited for 120 dollars. I turned this down because I had already located the capacitor on Amazon for 10.50. Mike then indicated that within a short time, my furnace blower motor could fail, and he quoted me 1,100.00 dollars, but I found the OEM motor online for 200 dollars so there is 900 dollars of markup and labor. I have had the same motor replaced on a sister unit within the last two years and it only takes the technician 45 minutes to change the motor out, so this markup and labor is insanely high. (Previous motor total replacement cost was 390 dollars. The upshot is that Riteway offered great service to our household but they are obviously putting the squeeze on their customers rather than taking care of them.","stars":2.0}

The food was absolutely delicious, the service was great, the music was perfect and the overall atmosphere was wonderful.

This is the second food place I have dined in since the pandemic started last year. But I am so happy that this is the second place I came to. I have told so many ppl about our experience this past Sunday and how wonderful Sunday Brunch is here. Everything that we ate was delicious. Seriously there was nothing that we did not enjoy! Oh and did I mention that the passion fruit Mimosas were the best way to wash down our food. Yes I can't wait to come back again and bring my boyfriend, family and friends with me.

I have never had eye lashes extensions or brow lamination.. I was nervous.

If you see this in the next two weeks or so do stop in! Perhaps your an old regular fan like me catching one last taste of that yellow gravy or maybe you have never been here but just love a meat and three (well two in this case but trust me it's still plenty) Its worth getting to before October 30th. The chicken and dressing is the absolute best. I recently waited 45 minutes for them to cook up a new batch and my patience was rewarded. You will also like the catfish or the beef tips. The chicken is pretty solid too but I've always thought a bit pedestrian. I'm not a meatloaf fan myself but my friends are and that always brings them back. There will probably be a line but they move quick as everything is served to go in a Styrofoam three section container by some very nice hosts. Anyways they have sold this location to a developer so I will not be surprised this time next year to be either visiting a new restaurant (probably very fancy and overpriced...) or bemoaning the addition of three or four new tall and skinnies at this spot. It really will be a loss for East Nashville. I was asking several customers recently inside if they had any thoughts on a similar restaurant nearby and nobody could really come up with a place that just does a menu right like this place and is welcoming to everyone. It is rumored the children of the owners are hoping to open their own place up. If they can produce solid comfort food like this i really hope they succeed.","stars":5.0}

The food was awesome, service was great and I really love the ambiance here. It was a very busy night given the occasion, but the entire staff and our waitress were on the ball. The staff was all dressed in sparkly party attire, which was a nice touch for the night. I ordered the Baby Kale and Beet Salad and the Spinach Ravioli. The salad was great, but I especially loved the Ravioli. I'm not one for thick heavy pasta dishes, but this Ravioli was prepared very thin. In fact you could see the spinach right through it. It was really tasty! The rest of the table ordered the Seared Tuna, Salmon Sashimi Pok\u00e9 Bowl, Braised Short Rib. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Dessert was the only thing that did not impress me too much. We ordered the Smores Cheesecake, and the Cookie and Brownie Sundae.

It was like actual fresh mint leaf flavor, and not the usual \"green\" mint that ice cream has - it was very tasty but I was shocked at first because my brain was not expecting fresh-crushed-in-a-mojito-mint flavor, at all. I can't wait to go back and try more - including the toasted marshmallow topping.","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Visiting family and they were nice enough to order for us. They ordered baby back ribs and bbq chicken with green beans, corn, mashed potatoes and french fries. The baby back ribs were overcooked, fall-off-the-bone mush. The chicken was a little overdone and the texture was rubbery. Also, everything was bathed in bbq sauce... I'm not sure what part of Texas this is supposed to represent but it is definitely NOT central Texas bbq. 2-stars as the rolls were pleasant (had a really subtle sweetness and were soft) and the corn was cooked perfectly al dente and was sweet with black pepper to create a slight flavor contrast. The mashed potatoes weren't bad but nothing to write home about. I can't comment on the green beans as I didn't partake. Hard pass from me for its bbq offerings. The other items might be better? IDK, but for what I did eat, I can't give anything higher than 2-stars. Note, that this was ordered for pickup so there are no star ratings for customer service.

They rearranged the entry for (presumably) more seating. We had a seat very close to the door and it was rather cold - not the end of the world. Ordered the spinach melt with fries, daughter went with a cheeseburger and fries. Melt was very good - larger in size, served on nice bread with tomato. Fries were hot and fresh and what I would describe as \"Shoestring boardwalk style\". Not a fan. Too little potato and too much grease. Sort of like the basket filler you get at a Long John Silver's. Daughter liked them though - she had half of mine. Noticed that the Roost was listed as a place to visit (!) from a customer who was in town on business.

We highly recommend it!","stars":5.0}

{"text":"Due to the over saturation of Chinese style restaurants here in Tucson, I was extremely pleased with brothers noodle shop. I tried the beef noodle soup and the pork cabbage dumplings. Both were cooked perfectly. quality of both dishes were present. however, I am big on meat quality and unfortunately it lacked in the beef soup. not to take away from the overall dish. the general appearance of this restaurant is humble and not very \"Americanized\". I personally didn't mind it, as most local Tucson owned restaurant poses some \" mom and pop feel\". As for the price, it was a little steep for just soup and dumplings. ranged in the $20.00 range. and food quantity was acceptable. However, I've been told in the past, new business usually have higher prices there first few opening months. Besides you pay for what you get! Which is quality! The staff was friendly, not as welcoming as I would have personally like them to be. It was often hard to understand them, but we managed! No harm done. I would recommend anyone who enjoys noodles to try this place. As the other reviews stated, its a great place to enjoy a quick bite.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"We made our way to Sanctuaria for our Valentine's Day date. We were thankfully it wasn't very busy and we were able to be sat in the greenhouse. That was a pretty cool environment! It wasn't too cold but I'd recommend a pullover or jacket. It's tapas and meant to be a little slower paced but our experience was really slow service. It took about 10 minutes to just get us waters. And another 15 minutes for our drinks. We had hoped to try more tapas but after 75 minutes, we'd only been able to get two plates. The food was delicious and our waiter was very kind. We felt bad for him because he kept apologizing for delays However, we needed to have faster service so we paid up and went to Urban Chestnut.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times. No meal has ever been great. The food is average and expensive. The portions are a good size. The sauces are all very strong, so I recommend getting them on the side. All the food is very rich and heavy. The salad bar is great and tastes fresh. We've ate dinner and Sunday brunch several times. Both are about the same. Tonight I had the steak frites. The meat was very fatty and each piece was cooked to a different level of medium to rare. I prefer more consistency. French fries are good and so is the trout almondine. The brownie dessert is good. The strawberry cake is better. The bread could be a little browner as it looks like it isn't done. The restaurant is dark and intentionally looks old even though it's fairly new in Cool Springs. Excellent service and food is timely. Nice bar area. Sit by the fireplace in the winter.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this Continental before, as it a favorite place of mine to people watch on the sidewalks of Old City. The food is decent, the drinks are fun and the atmosphere is cool. Some people avoid trendy Starr restaurants, but don't listen to them! This particular location can be a lot of fun. Sitting outside on the 2nd Street side, facing Cuba Libre, gives you a great view of their salsa dancing and the people walking to all of the bars down that way. Sitting on the Market Street side allows for people watching as they head to Penn's Landing. Inside is a different vibe altogether. It's a big restaurant, with three main sections of different atmospheres. The last time I went, I noticed two of my fave's were gone- the szechuan fries and the blackberry mojito. That made me sad :( There's honestly something for everyone though and the food is meant to be shared. Special Note: Save room for dessert and walk to Franklin Fountain or Shane's Candy Shoppe, basically right next door!","stars":3.0}
{"text":"I can't believe we've lived in Santa Barbara for more than 3 years and just finally tried ABC. I guess I've always thought the Paseo tasting rooms were fancy and intimidating and got used to frequenting our favorites in the Funk Zone, but I'm so glad we finally stopped and joined the wine club because they are quickly becoming a favorite. The wines are all interesting and quality but also affordable. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. They rotate the tasting menus frequently so there is always something new (we've been three times in a month and always took something new home). Definitely a must-try in Santa Barbara.","stars":5.0}
{"text":"This review is for the Jaeb Theater. Who knew that there were different theaters at the Straz Center? (Watch it just be me). I went to a performance of Disenchanted (a Disney princess variety show where they sang about what happens when it is not happily ever after) and was a little stumped when choosing a seat, because I did not understand I was going to be in a different theater than the main one. The set up for this theater is very different. Basically, there are rows of tables and four seats to a table. There are three tiers of tables in the Orchestra Section. We were in the last row of tables (front seats of the table) and I could still see ok, but I was a little miffed that I didn't realize that this was the set up and chose better seats. It is definitely a small theater, which makes audience interaction easy. It gave the whole night a more laid back vibe. It is also kind of fun sharing a table with someone else (hopefully you get good table mates). I like the theater, but next time I'll know to choose seats as close to the front no matter how far to the side they are!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"One of the largest Starbucks in town. Therefore has more space for added extras in food and coffee extras and seating. Service has always been friendly. Seating at tables, round tables, lounge like chairs, at a bar looking out to West End\/Harding and outdoor seating. Many meetings have been held in this Starbucks. Parking is shared with the strip mall but always a place to be found. Early am coffee drinkers are moved along nicely, so one doesn't feel like, \"Oh Snap, I should have skipped coffee this am\". The milk and sugar station remains filled and tidy and the tables and bar are clean. One of the top Starbucks in town due to size and hospitality combined. Others also have great quality service, but not the space. Close to many other places, Grocery, Liguor store, Mexican, Sushi, Sandwich place, Office store and Drug store AND close to 40 and 440. Looking for a meeting coffee place close to everything with great service and clean, BAZINGA, here it is!","stars":4.0}
{"text":"amazing service, very attentive and non intrusive to your dining experience. great spot if you're looking for ramen as well, they have a decent selection and I was able to try the miso and black garlic tonkotsu, both were solid broths and noodles. the toppings were flavorful for the ramen as well. we also had spicy tuna which was very flavorful and a decent size, and some at our table ordered the combo unagi (eel) and other combo rolls, which they enjoyed. I would go back and try out their vegan ramen just to see if the broth is water or if they worked hard on developing a decent flavor with it. The spot is small enough for a group of 4 but any more than that, then find a different spot.","stars":5.0}

It is the bar for working class old men AND aging alcoholic hipsters to pick up liver failure. But I do enjoy cheap, stiff drinks especially after a nasty break up and The Hub is the only place to go. Perfect for 30somethings with a tolerance.

{"text":"I thought it was just okay. My husband went to First Watch in Sarasota and loved the food, so he convinced me to go to St Pete one for breakfast last Sunday. The location isn't great. Right on a busy road. Not enough parking. We parked in the back (Walmart parking lot) and walked over. Busy place! We waited about 10 minutes and then were seated. It took a while for our server to come by (they were busy though) and she was very nice. We ordered coffee. It comes in a thermos and one keeps it on the table for easy refill. My decaf wasn't as hot as I like it... I ordered the special, turkey waffle with fruit cup. My husband got hash and eggs. Presentation was great! The waffle was yummy. However, it needed more flavor. Turkey doesn't have much and there didn't seem to be enough apple to balance it out. My husband said, \"the hash was dry. Not as good as Sarasota.\"","stars":3.0}

It is a bit ridiculous to pay 2.70 for a pastry you finish in 4 or 5 bites, but it's really good. The coffee here is (apparently) good (I don't drink the stuff) and it looks like their actual food is really overpriced. But whatever, the experience that I've had here is pretty solid. Always nice to stop by in the morning for a treat. Some complaints: their hours are terrible, especially over the summer. Basically whenever there aren't annoying penn undergrads around (any of the holidays) the place is closed any time you'd want to go. Including weekends and mornings till 9 am.","stars":4.0}
{"text":"This is the place New Jerseyans come to deal with the bureaucratic red tape that goes along with securing and maintaining the privilege of driving in the Garden State. Licenses, Registrations, Titles, Suspensions, Renewals and Appeals, all take place somewhere in this large (formerly Sears) facility. Parking is difficult despite all the government buildings in the area, and the lines for accomplishing anything seem to stand still for hours at a time. Still, the employees do their best to address your problems, and there is seldom an outburst of frustration. Yesterday, I represented someone who was to have his license suspended for two years due to some bad decisions several years ago. We appealed, and had a short hearing with a hearing officer to explain why this punishment would be an extreme hardship for him and his family. We were successful in reducing the suspension to 6 months. Still difficult, but much more manageable. We all left satisfied. I can't claim that is the result for everyone else who must venture into this giant labyrinth to deal with the autonomy of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, but the faces on those emerging from its dark doors attest that survival is assured.","stars":3.0}
{"text":"We have returned twice thus far in 2016. Service was exceptionally slow both times. During the first visit of 2016, the waitress apologized to our table for being slow because they had had their company party the night before and they were busy sharing pictures with each other. This was during regular lunch hours and the place was only 10% full, if that. There were four of us, we all ordered different items, but none of them were particularly exceptional save for the Yellowfin Tuna Cones. Those were very tasty, but very tiny. On the second return trip a few weeks later, we got the tuna cones again so my husband could try them. We had the soup of the day, which was a gumbo over mashed potatoes. It was tasty and I'd order it again, but it seemed like a comfort food you'd find in the Midwest. Again, the service was exceptionally slow and the restaurant was not particularly crowded. All in all, I feel like the food isn't as memorable as it once was, but it is decent. The service, however, really needs to pick it up. This is not the type of place to go if you are are looking to spend less than an hour+ on lunch.","stars":3.0}

Well, it happened twice! When we went there the second time, their system was not working properly and unless we paid for it, he would not let us bowl. Well, the boy at the counter did not even know at first about our reservation since the manager booked it and did not bother telling the front desk person. Then when that guy could not figure out how to use the register computer, the manager told us that our groupon had expired, at least that's what his system said. Well, we contacted groupon and confirmed the groupon was still valid. So because AMF's computer was malfunctioning, he would not let us bowl unless we paid. You have to look hard in order to find such a bad customer service and a manager who does not know what \"customer service\" is. As a manager, they can go around system malfunctions like that and still make a customer have a decent experience. Well, not this place!","stars":1.0}

Options start with a ride or lettuce base and from there you choose to proteins (cooked or raw meat or seafood) and as as many veggies and fruits as you'd like. Top it of with a sauce and a crunch and it will be the best meal you've had in a while. Today I came for some self care and reflection. I wanted to write in my journal while having food that would fuel me and it a bright sunny spot. Main Street Poke fulfilled all the requirements today. The staff is always friendly and patient while customers choose what they want. They've got great suggestions and will let you sample anything.

They have a nice choice of of meat and veggie combo sandwiches, panini, and wraps. With so many wounderful, healthy choices it was hard to choose. I went for Chipolte Turkey Breast with spicy organic greens, bacon and a choice of a sauce. I chose to have it in a wrap. All of the flavors blended together like a symphony. My husband started with Potato Leek soup. Yes, it was good. How do I know? I Tasted it, that's how. Sorry I got lost in my wrap so I don't recall what he had. Dessert, Mmmmmmm!! Season Fresh has home made Gelado. I had the Chocolate Orange, and my husband had a delicious creamed filled Italian pastry. The cafe also has an Espresso Bar, I had a very good Iced Cappucino. Fresh Squeezed Juices, and Smoothies are also items that might interest you. It's not a big cafe but there is an outdoor area that seems to be shaded. To my husband, good find honey!","stars":4.0}
